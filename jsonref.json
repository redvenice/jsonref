I\u0027m not clear on that.\u0027  Following the move, more than 50 pubs and breweries including Greene King, Heineken and Budweiser pleaded with the Government to extend support to avoid thousands of local venues going bust.In a letter to the Chancellor Rishi Sunak they said: \u0027It would be nothing less than heart-breaking if, having survived through the last nine months, pubs now face ruin with the end of the pandemic in sight.\u0027The support the Government has given us up to this point would all be for nothing, a colossal waste of resources. The looming disaster is avoidable, but only if you act now.\u0027Last week Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin announced he would shut down more than 50 of his pubs across Wales after the First Minister banned the sale of alcohol in bars and restaurants following a sharp uptick in infections, especially among the under-25s.The pub chain founder accused the First Minister of \u0027talking cobblers\u0027 about the coronavirus health risks and ruled out opening his pubs just to sell food and soft drinks in Wales, explaining it would \u0027not be viable to open\u0027. Under the new guidelines, pubs, bars and restaurants will only be allowed to remain open until 6pm and operate as takeaways afterwards. And they will not be allowed to serve alcoholic drinks under a scheme like that in place in Scotland for weeks.The move prompted bosses to issue a rallying cry and urge the Welsh government to provide \u0027proof\u0027 that their customers are more likely to catch Covid-19 in their establishments.Mr Martin said: \u0027I don\u0027t want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their First Minister, but he is talking cobblers.\u0027There is very good evidence that lockdowns, and this is a type of lockdown, simply don\u0027t work. There is lots of examples of that throughout the world. This scare tactic that so many people are going to die are nonsense in my opinion.\u0027Mr Martin went on to say it would not be viable for his business to remain open amid the restrictions.He continued: \u0027We are closing. It will not be viable to open. We tried it in Scotland when they brought in similar rules to Wales for a few weeks, but it was ruinously expensive.\u0027You can open for food, which is quite a big percentage of our trade, but what happens is a lot of people go out for a glass of wine, or a pint with a meal, so you lose a lot of your food sales as well. Overall, it is not viable.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c901a69f19276b4548ef34b62fbd3fdef9942c7a/0_98_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2b275b1b445d06ec23cd2ca3123340","title":"10 ways to maintain all round wellbeing this winter","story":"With the temperature dropping and the nights drawing in, it’s time to take extra good care of yourself and prepare for a fresh start in the new year As we stare down the barrel of winter with the added pressure of new lockdown restrictions, there’s never been a more pertinent time to focus on our wellbeing. For many, the unprecedented nature of this year has had a negative effect both physically and mentally, but with the end of the year fast approaching and the promise of a fresh start in 2021, now is a great time to give mind, body and soul a much needed overhaul.“This year, few of us have looked after ourselves the way we deserve to be looked after,” says personal fitness and strength trainer Matt McCormack (@mattmccormackpt). “Due to no fault of our own, we’ve neglected to give our bodies what they need, and anxiety and stress levels for many have been understandably sky-high. The temptation may be to put off making changes until the new year, but now is actually the ideal time to toughen up our bodies if we want to face the winter and life’s next chapter in the best possible shape.”So whether your aim is to feel trimmer, stronger or happier, the time is now – and yes, whatever the weather.1 Give booze a breakIf that sounds like a ridiculous suggestion with the festive season just around the corner, you don’t have to go completely dry as a bone, but a more mindful approach to how much – and what – you’re drinking could make a huge difference to your physical and mental health. “We all know that drinking to excess isn’t great for our bodies, so implementing some small changes to your drinking habits is really beneficial,” says nutritionist and founder of LunchboxDoctor, Jenny Tschiesche.“Try swapping some of your weekly alcoholic drinks for something like kombucha, which still feels special, treat-like and is very on-trend.”When choosing a non-alcoholic drink, keep an eye out for the sugar content – check the label and choose those drinks that are green for sugar when you can. It’s also a good option to aim for some entirely alcohol-free days throughout the week, so try downloading Public Health England’s Drink Free Days app, which can be found on the Apple App Store and Google Play.2 Keep a journalMove over meditation, there’s a new tool in town to achieve a clearer, happier mind: writing. According to some mental health professionals, keeping a journalis one of the best ways to release mental blocks, understand your feelings and attain your goals. You may have kept a daily gratitude list to remind yourself of things to feel thankful for, but trying a more expressive approach to writing can be a way of hacking into the deepest parts of the brain, helping us recognise our needs.Invest in a nice notebook and aim to write for 10-15 minutes each morning. Think of how you’re feeling, what you’re worried about, someone you’re angry with, hopes for that day – and see what comes out.3 Download a fitness appSometimes we all need a helping hand, so why not lean on an app? Whether it’s to track your diet, plan a workout or record your daily physical activity, checking in with your phone or smartwatch is a great way to help you keep on top of your health and fitness goals – and set new ones when the time is right. “I see it all the time with my clients, especially during this time of the year,” says McCormack.“They lose track of what they’re eating or drinking, which then spirals into bad choices and habits, quickly followed by negative thoughts. But using a fitness app is a brilliant and simple way to regain some control and keep your health and fitness in order.”Apps such as MyFitnessPal are free to download and can help you keep an eye on what you’re eating, the number of steps you’re doing, and even make everything feel more manageable, which is often half the battle.4 Get a flu jabWith the spread of Covid-19, it’s easy to forget that it’s also important to protect yourself against the flu – especially so if you’re in a high-risk category for coronavirus, as research has shown you’re more likely to get seriously ill if you get the flu and contract coronavirus at the same time.The good news is that by getting a flu jab, you’ll help reduce pressure on the NHS and social care staff who may be dealing with the pandemic. Changes including social distancing, hand washing and wearing protective equipment have now been made to ensure it’s safe to get your flu jab at GP surgeries and pharmacies, so go and book one in for peace of mind.5 Seek out supportWinter can be lonely. Anything from weather conditions to potential restrictions due to the pandemic could keep us from loved ones this festive season. Plus the reduced sunlight can reduce our body’s production of serotonin, potentially making us feel low and more alone.Kate Lucey, author of Get a Grip, Love, says that right now we need to make the effort to talk to each other – but with our voices and not just a WhatsApp or text message.“We’ve become a bit scared of phone calls,” she says. “Don’t plan it, just dial. Send a voice note if they don’t answer, and even if you have to play phone tag you’ll get there eventually. Voice action is so much more nourishing than a message.”Conversation keeps us feeling connected so make a list of three people a day that you could contact – and make it happen. If you’re not able to get in touch with someone, or you’d just like to find out more about managing your mental health and wellbeing, head to nhs.ukoneyouevery-mind-matters.6 Invest in supplementsIt’s that time of year when we can’t make vitamin D from sunshine. To keep your bones and muscles healthy it’s best to take a vitamin D supplement every day between October and early March. This is especially important as many of us have been indoors more than usual this spring and summer.“The majority of us don’t get the sufficient amounts of vitamin D through our diet, and with sunlight limited at this time of year, in my opinion, we should all be supplementing,” says Tschiesche.You can get vitamin D from most pharmacies, and supermarkets and other retailers. Just 10 micrograms a day is all you need – it’s the same for the whole family.7 Stop smokingThinking of knocking smoking on the head in the new year? Why wait? By quitting now, you’ll reap the rewards almost immediately. Longer-term benefits include reducing your risk of lung problems, heart problems and various types of cancer. In the short term, if you stopped now you would be free of nicotine, finding it easier to breathe and have a pocket full of surplus cash by the time you’re singing Auld Lang Syne. Plus, you’ll have the hard bit out of the way.“Quitting smoking is always a fantastic idea,” says Dr Catherine McCullagh, a trainee GP. “But people don’t realise that you can feel the benefits immediately. Contact your GP or pharmacist about the various options available to help you quit – often they can refer you to a smoking cessation clinic where you will receive specialist advice.”8 Get outdoorsThe great outdoors might be wet and wild right now, but a winter walk (find one near you at walkingbritain) is the best way of blowing away the cobwebs. Fresh air has higher levels of oxygen than indoor air, so getting outdoors for a brisk 20-minute walk each day is good for your lungs, blood pressure, circulation and heart rate. Plus, more oxygen is thought to result in greater brain functioning, improving energy and concentration skills – perfect for anyone working from home.Entice your kids out with a homemade scavenger hunt. Make a checklist of 10 things – such as acorns, feathers, yellow leaves – and head to the woods, only returning when you’ve found them all. Not close to woodland? No problem. Even a walk around the streets with a list of items to spot – a black cat, three buses, Christmas trees in windows – can turn exercise into a fun, and free, game.9 Light a scented candleBurning a scented candle doesn’t just achieve peak winter ambience, it can also do wonders for your wellbeing. The combination of essential oils in some aromatherapy candles – such as lavender, rose or lemon balm – can relieve anxiety and reduce stress.And there’s more ... stuffy noses and congested chests can be eased by burning peppermint or eucalyptus. Sleep can be helped by a chamomile or sandalwood candle – just remember to blow it out before your head hits the pillow – and energy may be boosted by the scent of bergamot, cinnamon or ginger.10 Treat yourselfWhen it comes down to it though, 2020 has been hard enough. For long stretches of this year, we haven’t been able to enjoy a sit-down meal at a restaurant or the comforts of a Sunday roast at the pub. While it’s important for us to take care of our bodies, this winter really isn’t the time to start feeling guilty and deny ourselves a little taste of the good stuff. We’ve missed out on enough this year, thank you very much.So have a treat and reach for the chocolate when you want to, whether it’s milk chocolate, or dark chocolate – which is generally a bit lower in calories and sugar – just enjoy. Of course, moderation is key, but as Francesco Petrarch said: “A little bit of sweetness can drown out a whole lot of bitterness.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Following on from Land of Ibeji, Sanne de Wilde and Bénédicte Kurzen travel to Mojiang in Yunnan for the second chapter of their project about the mythology of twinhood. The area has an exceptionally high percentage of twins, celebrated in its annual tropic of cancer twin festival The first chapter of this project was called Land Of Ibeji. West Africa, and specifically Yorubaland, has 10 times more twins than any other region in the world. Ibeji, meaning “double birth” and “the inseparable two” in Yoruba stands for the ultimate harmony between two people. “Shuang bao tai”, 双胞胎 is the Chinese word for twin, which translates as: 双 double 胞 womb 胎 embryo.These legendary twin wells are located in the nearby village of Hexi, where 100 families have given birth to 10 sets of twins. Tales abound in local folklore, recounting how one pair of twins has transformed into two magic wells. The wells are a popular destination for newly wed couples, as the water is believed to increase fertility. It is said that many couples come to drink from the wells hoping to get pregnant with twins, especially important when China’s one-child policy was in place.Mojiang has been hosting the tropic of cancer international twins festival for the past 15 years, attracting thousands of twins and visitors from all corners of the world. The festival brings together the multiple dimensions of the role twinhood plays in Yunnan and in China: the Hani sun celebration, the unusually high twin fertility rate, the Taoist immortal figures, and recent Chinese government policies have all encouraged old religions and beliefs.Tales about twins abound in local folklore and in centuries-old Taoist traditions. In Mojiang, an entrepreneur saw the twin legend as a possible economic venture that could go hand in hand with the colourful sun festival of the Hani people. Now every year, thousands of visitors flock through streets crowded with vendors, while Hani people proudly wear their traditional outfits and sing songs.The more generic Chinese culture, which has been infused with the Taoist cosmology, philosophy and beliefs, uses an endearing representations of twins: “the laughing twins” or “He-He Er Xian”, which translate as “the immortals of harmony and union” and as the “two gods of harmony and union”, and are usually bald and smiling. These two immortals symbolise perfect partnership and express the idea that harmony is more profitable than strife, and are a centuries-old wedding gift.The photographic approach extends beyond appearance, to show the twin as a mythological figure and a powerful metaphor for the duality within a human being, and the duality we experience in the world that surrounds us. It reflects the “other”, the double, the doppelganger, our shadow self, our reflection in the mirror. This visual narrative and an aesthetic language, exploring new documentary strategies, is meant to reflect and empower the culture that celebrates twins, with symmetry, resemblance and reflections as tools.To highlight the “magical” and “supernatural”, to visualise that what can not be seen, two colour filters were used in certain pictures, amplifying the duality of two perceptions coloured differently. Purple referenced the mythology and storytelling: Mojiang is geographically tied to the tropic of cancer and is said to have a special “feng shui” and to be a ying-yang balancing point, which results in purple vegetables and the famous purple rice (a sign of prosperity and fertility) in the region. Blue is used to refer to water, the beginning of life and the magical twin wells.Layers of portraiture, double exposure, landscape and still life come together as a visual narrative translating the mythology of twinhood. Various photographic genres have duality as a key theme: the metaphor and the literal, the visible and the invisible, the material and the spiritual.There is a fascination for twins around the world. Although many of the myths and stories about twinhood have faded or been forgotten, it is a recurring theme weaving through biblical and cultural storytelling, philosophy and even science. Think of the Gemini stars Castor and Pollux, Romulus and Remus creating Rome, and Plato articulating the dual nature of humanity.The mythology of twinhood becomes a way to address themes such as identity, genetics, economy, religion, environmental issues, the one-child policy, censorship, cultural tourism and demographics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cff795fdd7e9b1fb1c1d89863c62d1d8b5a41fa/0_263_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355dc9f3ff402308bf8e9af5490f411d","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Paris, wildfires in California, a monolith in Utah, the conflict in Ethiopia and the enduring impact of Covid-19: the most striking images from around the world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b655adba461c848b12217bb31b5c661e57e19866/0_211_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b68d4026b198c4fa8783e0c21b290244","title":"the beauty of starling murmurations in pictures","story":"Copenhagen-based Søren Solkær , best known for taking photographic portraits of big names in music and film such as Björk and David Lynch, has spent the past four years capturing starling murmurations.

In total they have vowed to pay back more than £2bn to the UK government.The business rates holiday was announced by the government in March to help retailers that were forced to close during the national coronavirus lockdown. However, supermarkets and other essential retailers that were allowed to stay open through the pandemic reported big sales increases and have come under pressure to repay the financial support. Their position became increasingly untenable, especially after their decision to resume idend payments to shareholders.Amazon will repay £2m in business rates relief it received for its food chain Whole Foods Market, according to the real estate adviser Altus Group.However, Marks \u0026amp Spencer and the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose, have refused to follow suit even though they also benefited from strong food sales during the pandemic. They argue that they need the government support because of the financial strain placed on their clothing and homewares businesses during the crisis.Kingfisher said it had repaid the £23m it received under the government’s job retention scheme.Its chief executive, Thierry Garnier, said that “returning the UK and Irish business rates relief in full is the right thing to do”.He said Kingfisher, which owns the B\u0026ampQ and Screwfix DIY chains, had reported a strong sales performance since it reopened its stores in late April and early May, helped by higher demand for home improvement during the pandemic.Pets at Home – £29m"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3919e3ded06f2bfc3aa87071ca28fb47c5b77798/0_121_4330_2598/master/4330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40841891bbd6b196046cc9d1ead75fcd","title":"uk covid savings haldane bank of england","story":"Bank of England’s chief economist says spending spree could help Britain bounce backExcess savings of about £100bn built up by UK households during Covid-19 lockdowns are now being spent and could speed up Britain’s economic recovery, according to the Bank of England’s chief economist.Andy Haldane told the Daily Mail there was “huge pent-up demand”, and that a big spending spree could help the economy bounce back more quickly than forecasters expected.Haldane said the surge in saving had not been evenly balanced across society. While many office workers have saved money by working from home, thousands of other people – especially younger workers and women – have lost their jobs in the hospitality and retail sectors.“Nonetheless it did mean there is a pool of excess savings – excess because they weren’t planned,” he said. “As people’s incomes held up and spending was restrained, they have amassed around £100bn of excess savings.”High streets were packed with Christmas shoppers as shops reopened last week. “Consumer spending has come back at real pace,” Haldane said. “Households have shown unbelievable resilience.”Even during the November lockdown in England or other local lockdowns, when restaurants, pubs, cafes and non-essential shops were closed, many people bought other things instead, such as takeaways and patio heaters, he said.Haldane also predicted some “catch-up in social spending” although some of the money that could not be spent while pubs and restaurants were shut is “gone and lost forever”. Once vaccines are given to people to protect them from coronavirus – starting in the UK on Tuesday – this spending should accelerate.Haldane said: “You are not going to go to the pub twice as much when they’re open again, but there will be some catch-up in social spending. There is plenty of scope there for the vaccine to release more of that pent-up demand.”Accidental savers working from home have not had any commuting costs and have been unable to spend on holidays either. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that better-off families saved, on average, more than £300 a month between March and September, while the poorest households were £170 a month worse off.Haldane also believes the pandemic could help improve the UK’s poor productivity by increasing firms’ investment in technology and training in digital skills."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f856eeab7338348cd1cc875e9bb25fe5429fd103/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4db0d8b901fe197ae51957581826a256","title":"mike ashley frasers group debenhams uk house prices ftse pound brexit business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsUK house prices are rising at their fastest pace in over four years, as the pandemic drives some families to move into larger houses away from the city.Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, explains how Covid-19 is driving the market: “With mortgage approvals at a 13-year high, the current market continues to be shaped by a desire for more space, the move from urban to rural locations and indications of a trend for more home working in the future. The current stamp duty holiday is also pushing up demand. Galley points out that the recent price rises actually outstrip the saving since chancellor Rishi Sunak temporarily suspended stamp duty on properties up to £500k.It is interesting to note that the stamp duty saving of £2,500 on a home costing £250,000 is now far outweighed by the average increase in property prices since July. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould warns that some store closures are inevitable even if Mike Ashley pulls off a late deal for Debenhams.Mould also predicts Ashley will push for rent cuts -- as Debenhams collapse was partly caused by being trapped in expensive, long-term leases by its former private equity owners:“To no great surprise retail kingpin Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group is in for Debenhams at the 11th hour.“Ashley has been the great dealmaker of the high street in recent years and after JD Sports pulled out of its own deal for the department store it felt almost inevitable he would throw his hat into the ring.“Having acquired another ailing chain in House of Fraser in 2018, you can see what Ashley’s playbook is likely to be with some store closures a relative certainty, perhaps even more so given House of Fraser and Debenhams stores will often sit cheek by jowl. He will also look to drive a hard bargain with landlords.“Ashley might be interested in some of Debenhams’ in-house brands which he might then be able to sell in other outlets.“The queues outside Debenhams since lockdown was lifted in England suggest the wider Debenhams name still resonates with shoppers although there was also likely an element of opportunistic bargain hunters inspired what they expected to be a big closing down sale.“If the brand had that much appeal Debenhams arguably wouldn’t be in the mess it is now. It failed to adapt to the changing retail landscape and was left looking sluggish by its rivals.“Obstacles to a deal remain, time is short and Frasers itself acknowledges the Arcadia administration process as an obstacle given it iswas the main concession holder in Debenhams stores.“What seems likely is that the recent consolidation and failures in retail will not be the end of the story with the weaker players facing a big reckoning after a desperate attempt to salvage Christmas.”The organisers of the Paris Air Show, the biggest event in the global aviation calendar, have announced its cancellation in 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.The show had been scheduled to take place between 21 and 27 June 2021, and its website was advertising opportunities to exhibit up until Monday morning. The next show will take place in June 2023, the show’s organisers said.The Paris air show is the latest in a long line of trade fairs and shows that have been cancelled because of the pandemic, including the biggest motor shows. The UK’s Farnborough air show in July 2020 was hastily reorganised to run online (Farnborough alternates with Paris and runs in even-numbered years).The global aviation industry has been particularly badly hit by the pandemic, forcing airlines and aerospace companies to drastically cut spending.Orders for new planes - usually a key feature of behind-the-scenes talks at air shows - have slumped to record lows, with demand not expected to recover to 2019 levels for four or five years.The Paris organisers said their decision was “inevitable” because of the large number of visitors the show attracts. Those exhibitors who have signed up will be fully refunded.Patrick Daher, the chairman of aerospace company Daher Group who also chaired the air show, said:“We are obviously disappointed not to be able to hold the 2021 edition of the Paris Air Show. After many months of all trade show activities being suspended throughout the world, the entire international aerospace and defence community was very much looking forward to being able to meet. We have already started work to ensure that the 2023 edition celebrates the resurgence of the aerospace industry on an international scale.” The pound’s weakness has helped to push the FTSE 100 up to a new nine-month high.As well as the Brexit talks, investors are digesting reports that the United States is preparing to impose sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials, for disqualifying elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong. The Covid-19 pandemic continues to rage in America too. More than 23 million people in Southern California are now under the harshest lockdowns in the United States, as Covid-19 cases hit record levels in the country’s most populous state.Shares in UK-focused companies are also falling this morning, as Brexit worries ripple through the City.Here’s Ranko Berich, Head of Market Analysis at Monex Europe, on the pound’s weakness this morning:“Sterling remains firmly on the Brexit headline merry-go-round, and this morning is selling off after assorted anonymously sourced reports indicating that the threat of no-deal Brexit is looming large in the market’s mind for the umpteenth time. “The Sun newspaper - hardly an impartial outlet on this topic - is reporting that Boris Johnson is set to walk away from trade negotiations as early as this morning. The UK may indeed be just about to withdraw from negotiations, but equally, this morning’s Sun story could also be part of a bid by Boris Johnson to sell an incoming deal as a hard-won breakthrough, or indeed a negotiating tactic. For now, the added uncertainty has been enough to send sterling reeling to its lowest levels against the euro since October, and significantly raise bets in fixed income markets for negative rates from the Bank of England.Ricardo Evangelista, senior analyst at ActivTrades, says the markets are getting anxious about the Brexit trade deal talks...The markets are showing signs of nervousness, as the talks between the EU and the UK continue with both camps’ positions remaining far apart on the issue of the so-called level playing field. As time begins to run out, the base case scenario for the majority of investors is still that an agreement will be reached before time runs out.However, the clock is ticking and every day that passes without an agreement being reached increases the pressure and raises the stakes, forcing investors to start factoring in the possibility of there being no deal in place by December 31, at the end of the transition period.The pound has also dropped sharply against the euro this morning.Sterling has slumped this morning amid fears that Britain and the European Union will fail to reach a free trade deal.The pound has tumbled by two cents against the US dollar to $1.323, a hefty slide, as negotiators began a last effort to overcome their differences on several key issues.Back on Friday, the pound hit its highest level against the US dollar since May 2018, on hopes that negotiators were close to a breakthrough.But the failure to reach agreement over the weekend on issues such as the level playing field between the two sides, and fishing rights, is worrying investors this morning, knocking sterling back to a two-week low.Michel Barnier, EU chief negotiator, briefed ambassadors from the 27 EU member states on the situation this morning - one diplomat told Reuters that he was very downbeat.The diplomat, who was at the briefing, said Barnier told the envoys that differences between the EU and London persisted on the three main issues that have long ided them, and that the ball was now in British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s court. Ireland’s foreign minister has also warned that no progress was made yesterday, ahead of a crucial European Council meeting on Thursday. Our Politics Live blog has all the details:Games Workshop continues to defy the crisis on the high street.The hobby group, which sells Warhammer fantasy figurines to a loyal fanbase, has swelled its sales and profits again.Games Workshop racked up sales of £185m in the last six months, up from £148m a year earlier. That’s lifted its earnings to at least £90m before tax, up from £59m.We are delighted with the global team performance in the first half given the back drop of major projects and some government restrictions. Games Workshop has been booming for several years now, with customers keen to buy products like Blood Angels Death Company Intercessors (£27.50) and Kraken-eater Mega-Gargant (£120) to compete in a tabletop conflict. The company is now worth over £3bn, with new, simpler rules and better engagement with its fan base paying off.As the FT explained in September:What pulled Games Workshop shares out of their rut was the arrival of Kevin Rountree as chief executive in 2015. The company had previously been at war with its best customers, firing off reams of cease-and-desist letters to internet fan sites for breach of copyright.Mr Rountree rebuilt bridges with the community, having recognised the marketing value of social media. Or as we wrote last year, Games Workshop succeeded by “ruthlessly recruiting followers, and creating vast, fascinating worlds that diehard players never want to leave.” Professor John Colley, Associate Dean of Warwick Business School, says Mike Ashley will be hoping to take the profitable parts of Debenhams, through these last-minute rescue talks.“Mike Ashley has learnt the best way to buy a business is out of administration as there is no debt and all contracts can be renegotiated. This is ideal as his real strength is negotiating efficient and low cost supply chains.“Administrations also mean the buyer can take the profitable parts and leave the rest. For Debenhams, Mike has waited for ‘last shout’ - that is the announcement of liquidation - to get the best deal. The good news is it is likely some stores and jobs will be retained.“If he is successful Debenhams is likely to take on the same feel and appearance as his House of Fraser stores, lacking in soul, with cut down ranges and much reduced floor space. However, that is much better that the alternative - major closures and hollowed out town centres.”In other retail news, DIY chain Kingfisher has joined the ranks of companies repaying their business rates relief.Kingfisher, which owns B\u0026ampQ, is waiving £130m of property tax relief. This takes the amount handed back in the last few days to over £2bn, since Tesco created a domino effect by deciding to return £585m of relief.Kingfisher enjoyed a sales boom this summer after the first wave of Covid-19, as people looked to improve their homes to make remote working and studying easier.So, like the supermarkets and retailers such as B\u0026ampM and Pets at Home, Kingfisher has now concluded that it can’t justify keeping the money (which was awarded by ministers back in March as part of Covid-19 relief efforts).Andy Cosslett, Chairman of Kingfisher, hopes the money will be used to help those struggling in the pandemic, saying:Kingfisher is in a sound financial position with continuing positive trading momentum, due to both strong consumer demand and the benefits of our strategy.We are pleased that we are in a position to do this, and hope that the money can now be redeployed by the government and local authorities where it is needed most.”Retail analyst Nick Bubb says it’s “extraordinary” that Mike Ashley is “still pursuing his dream of buying the bankrupt Debenhams”.If Ashley did pull it off, Debenhams would join House of Fraser, Sports Direct, Game Group, Evans Cycles and Jack Wills within the Frasers empire. Frasers reportedly bid £125m for Debenhams in October, but then walked away from talks saying the £300m price tag was too high.Bloomberg has a good take on Mike Ashley’s last-ditch bid to buy Debenhams:Debenhams has 124 stores, all rented, and if a deal is completed Frasers could operate them on a 12-month license while determining how many stores could be saved, said a person familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified as the matter is confidential. Debenhams declined to comment on the talks with Frasers Group.The person said any deal with Frasers would have to be better than the liquidation value of Debenhams and negotiations with FRP Advisory, the administrator that has been in control of the department store since April, were likely to centre on a value of around £280m.But the collapse of Philip Green’s Arcadia business - which runs Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge concessions in Debenhams stores - could makes a rescue trickier.“We have found that Debenhams has been overly reliant on Arcadia for many years,” said Chris Wootton, financial director of Frasers, in an emailed statement.“As well as no end in sight to the outdated business rates regime which unduly punishes the likes of Debenhams, it may may this a bridge too far for the Frasers Group.” Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Could Mike Ashley save Debenhams from liquidation?Days after the venerable UK retailer’s administrators started to wind it down, Ashley’s Frasers Group is in talks to, possible, rescue the business - which employs 12,000 people.Frasers told the City this morning that it is negotiating with Debenhams about a possible rescue deal.However it cautioned that time is short. The collapse of Arcadia (Debenham’s biggest customer) last week makes a rescue package more complicated, the company adds.Here’s the statement:The Company confirms that it is in negotiations with the administrators of Debenhams’ UK business regarding a potential rescue transaction for Debenhams’ UK operations. Whilst Frasers Group hopes that a rescue package can be put in place and jobs saved, time is short and the position is further complicated by the recent administration of the Arcadia Group, Debenhams’ biggest concession holder. There is no certainty that any transaction will take place, particularly if discussions cannot be concluded swiftly Yesterday, the Sunday Times reported that Ashley was “racing to seal a last-gasp rescue of Debenhams”, adding:The Frasers Group tycoon has revived his interest in taking over the struggling department store chain at the eleventh hour. The move could save Debenhams from liquidation: the 242-year-old group had seemed set to disappear from the high street for good after JD Sports withdrew from the running to buy it from administrators last Tuesday.Ashley’s group, which owns Sports Direct, and advisers to Debenhams are trying to thrash out a deal that could value the chain at more than £200m, depending on how much stock is left. Frasers would operate Debenhams’ 124 stores under 12-month licences.Last week, former Debenhams chairman Ian Cheshire predicted that some parts of the UK business could be saved, which could protect some of the 12,000 jobs on the line.“(There) is a fantastic business inside it, probably 70 stores, and a very good website which I’m sure someone will be buying, so I don’t think all these jobs are going."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c0965bc44c12babbf79bc0d01433409fca65400/0_15_3151_1891/master/3151.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=74aa2910723f6418c47eaa50ac6f776e","title":"from a sensational sauna to a ufo bedroom 10 amazing swedish designs you wont want to miss","story":"When cutting-edge creativity meets fantastical landscapes, the results can be quite breathtaking … take a look at how Sweden is inspiring an architectural revolution• New national restrictions apply from 5 November, please consult government advice before planning to travelFrom the ancient wooden dwellings of the middle ages to the experimental postmodernism of the 1960s, Swedish architecture has charged through countless different styles and eras, bending European trends to its own Nordic context while also creating an independent vernacular.The country’s architects now frequently lead the field, and a vibrant tradition of modern design has resulted in great experimentation and innovation over recent decades – from spectacular feats of civic engineering to hip saunas and the coolest hotels, all wonderful for the visitor to behold.These are 10 of the most design-forward buildings and sights for cultural travellers to lay their eyes on:1. Öresund Bridge, MalmöA road and railway run parallel across one of the world’s longest cable-tied bridges then, at an artificial island, disappear into an underwater tunnel as if being sucked down a plughole.This incredible 16km (9.9-mile) structure seems to defy the possibilities of engineering, while creating a valuable trade and transport link between Copenhagen, in Denmark, and Malmö, Sweden’s third largest city. The Öresund Bridge section alone is about 8km (5 miles) long and will be familiar to British TV viewers as the setting for the Scandi-noir drama The Bridge.2. The Sauna in Frihamnen, Gothenburg In a land peppered with sleek designer sauna huts, both private and public, which showcase the ingenuity of talented architects, for one to be widely praised by design critics as the country’s most spectacular is quite an accolade. The Sauna in Frihamnen, which opened in a newly fashionable area of Gothenburg in 2015, immediately caused a sensation with its striking metal form, built from rusted corrugated steel. The design made extensive use of other recycled materials, too – 12,000 glass bottles were used in the construction of the changing rooms alone. Happily, it’s free for anyone to use, alongside an outdoor pool by the river in which to cool off.3. Treehotel, Luleå Swedish LaplandA global accommodation gamechanger when it launched its treetop cabins in 2010, the Treehotel has come to be one of the most recognisable and lusted-after places to stay in Scandinavia.Suspended 4-10m above ground in a spectacular Lapland pine forest are seven cabins, inidually designed by renowned architects, among them the Swede Bertil Harström, who is the only one to have created two treehouses – the UFO, resembling a flying saucer, and Bird’s Nest, whose exterior is a frenzied mass of sticks and branches.Guests go cross-country skiing through forest, watch the aurora borealis, kayak, and feast on gourmet meals of wild moose with foraged berries. There’s time, too, for fika picnics, which embrace the Swedish tradition of having a cosy break for coffee and cake with friends.4. Artipelag, VärmdöArtipelag, a vast exhibition centre that celebrates art, architecture, Swedish design and food, sits in a natural environment of pine trees, cliffs and magnificent views, about 20km (12.4 miles) east of Stockholm. The aim of the architect Johan Nyrén was to create a building in harmony with its surroundings and the elements. As a result, a crackling fire welcomes visitors into the entrance hall, from where they see seawater glittering through floor-to-ceiling windows. In the cafe and patisserie, a huge rounded gneiss rock protrudes through the floor. Outside, larch boardwalks skip across rocks and water to a sculpture trail through the forest. To make the visit even more special, gallery-goers can travel to Artipelag through the Stockholm archipelago on board a 19th-century ship.5. ArkNat shelters, High CoastEvery year since 2017, groups of young architecture students have taken to the 130km (81-mile) High Coast Trail in north-east Sweden to design and build beautifully crafted wind shelters and resting places for hikers as part of the ArkNat project. The High Coast, a Unesco world heritage site of granite cliffs and rocky islands, stretches from Hornöberget in the south to Örnsköldsvik in the north. Along the trail it’s a joy to stumble across and take time to appreciate the ArkNat spots, such as Forest Cradle, a curvaceous floating wooden day bed in the forest near Mount Skuleberget. For 2021, the project moves from the High Coast region to the southern county of Skåne to provide a fresh crop of inventive havens along glorious walking trails.6. Kalmar konstmuseum, KalmarOne of the country’s most interesting contemporary art museums, the Kalmar konstmuseum, on the south-east Baltic coast, was the result of an architecture competition that attracted almost 300 entrants. The winners, Martin Videgård Hansson and Bolle Tham, envisaged a black cube housing four floors of exhibitions, studios, a library and offices, with views over the sea and the city. In contrast to the dark, wood-clad exterior, the interiors are of smooth, pale concrete where light and shadow play. The Kalmar konstmuseum won Sweden’s most prestigious architecture prize, the Kasper Salin Prize in 2008, its inaugural year.7. Icehotel, Jukkasjärvi, northern SwedenThere can’t be a traveller on earth who hasn’t heard of the magical Icehotel, 17km (10.5 miles) east of Kiruna and 200km (124 miles) north of the Arctic Circle, which was the world’s first when it opened in 1989, and has reinvented itself extravagantly every winter since. Between October and December each year, dozens of artists and collaborators chip away at ice from the Torne River to form spectacular new suites – one may be full of ice toys, another a frozen winter garden. The newly created ice extravaganzas are available for occupation from mid December this year to the end of March, but one section of the hotel, Ice 365, now remains open year round, using solar energy to freeze rooms. If you can’t fit in an overnight stay, day visitors are welcome at the ice bar and exhibitions.8. Naturums, nationwideIn many countries, visitor centres at nature reserves tend to be lacklustre prefab cabins devoid of style. Not in Sweden, where 31 design-led naturums (nature rooms) in national parks and nature reserves are examples of architectural brilliance. The centres host activities, exhibitions and provide information about the beautiful areas they inhabit, yet even their own aesthetics are cause for admiration. Naturum Vänerskärgården-Victoriahuset’s facade of wooden strips, for example, was inspired by the reeds and driftwood of its surroundings at Lake Vänern – the EU’s largest lake – and features a hotel, too.9. Sara Cultural CentreNot far from the Arctic Circle, the city of Skellefteå is building the Sara Cultural Centre, which, at 20 storeys high, is expected to be the world’s tallest wooden building. Due to open in 2021, the structure will house a theatre, art gallery, museum and the city library. There will be a hotel and a restaurant, too, both of which will have panoramic city views. Designed by architect Oskar Norelius, this futuristic building pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved in timber construction, while at the same time having a low environmental impact thanks the renewable nature of wood. Additionally, its green roof will contribute to thermal insulation, enhance bioersity and delay rainwater run-off.10. National Museum, StockholmIf any building exemplifies Sweden’s ability to pay homage to its past while embracing the future, it’s the National Museum. Opened in 1866, it is not only one of Europe’s best preserved 19th-century museum buildings but one of the most modern thanks to a five-year renovation that was completed in 2018. While the building’s symmetrical facade was restored to its former glory using stone that matched the original, the interior was sensitively updated to allow more of the museum’s vast collection of art to be displayed in a contemporary manner. The museum also gained a glass roof, a lift and a new restaurant that serves classic Swedish cuisine with a modern touch, think elk stew with pickled red carrot or seared cured salmon with cucumber salad.Welcome to Sweden when the time is rightTo discover more about architecture and design in Sweden, head to Visit Sweden were you’ll find even more places you won’t want to missGet advice about travelling to Sweden, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at gov.ukforeign-travel-advicesweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4b256e746b79a35f6ae76347238900ec3b63d11/0_272_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a584eaf0b6766d034cee0d89ee0b9547","title":"teachers in the uk coronavirus what has this term been like","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers about their experience of managing this term during the coronavirus pandemic The start of this academic year has been unlike any other, with teachers managing student bubbles, staffing problems, and additional hygiene rituals.

Finally, life has been breathed into Tottenham’s season. Rehanne Skinner said her introduction to management in England’s top flight “could not have gone any better” after a 3-1 defeat of Brighton.Having moved her team into the club’s Hotspur Way training facility full-time, the former assistant to Phil Neville at England had a very short time after the international break to make an impact, but the win, a performance full of fight and a late penalty for the USA superstar Morgan have transformed the fortunes of the previously winless side.Skinner had said before the game it was “a lot to ask in a short space of time to turn things around”. After, she was “really pleased” with how much had filtered on to the pitch.“They’ve come into the environment, listened to what we want to get out of it and then bought into how we want to play moving forward,” Skinner said. “If you have that you get in a position where things will start to translate into the game a bit better.”Skinner has a much kinder run of fixtures than the one that led to the departure of the co-managers Karen Hills and Juan Amoros. They played top-five teams seven times in their opening 11 games in all competitions, leaving Skinner to inherit players who have gone through test after test against the best in the league.Her attempt to lift spirits swiftly appeared to have worked. Early pressure on Morgan as she skated towards the box led to a generous free‑kick and Kerys Harrop stepped up to whip it into a top corner, grazing a hand of the Brighton goalkeeper, Megan Walsh. At 11 minutes it was Spurs’ earliest goal this term.A hat-trick from Australia striker Sam Kerr helped Chelsea past a resilient\u0026nbspand manager-less West Ham and ensured the Blues stay three points behind\u0026nbspleague leaders Manchester United with a game in hand.England\u0027s Rachel Daly had equalised for the Hammers early in the second\u0026nbsphalf following Kerr\u0027s opener but two more goals from the former NWSL and\u0026nbspW-League top scorer ensured the Chelsea had done enough before a late own\u0026nbspgoal from captain Magda Eriksson.Arsenal remain two points ahead of their London rivals in second after\u0026nbspthree goals in just over 30 minutes crushed Birmingham for a 3-0 win. Hannah Hampton\u0026nbspsaved a Kim Little penalty to keep her team in the game before goals from\u0026nbspforwards Caitlin Foord and Jill Roord and another Little penalty ended\u0026nbsphopes of taking something from the game.Manchester City\u0027s 3-0 victory over Everton, to leapfrog them into fourth,\u0026nbspwas marred by injury to US World Cup star Rose Lavelle. Having scored a\u0026nbspcracker for the US against their World Cup final opponents the Netherlands\u0026nbsplast week, Lavelle was making her second league start for City before being\u0026nbspforced off at half time. First-half goals from England striker Ellen White,\u0026nbspcentre back Gemma Bonner and Canadian forward Janine Beckie had already\u0026nbspensured the win.Bristol City earned their second point of the season in a 1-1 draw after taking the lead\u0026nbspagainst Reading just before half time on the counter. Emma Bissell\u0027s goal\u0026nbspwas cancelled out by Fara Williams but a dominant Reading could not find\u0026nbspthe win.Brighton struggled to carve out chances, with signs of Skinner’s aim of putting her team “in a position where we’re making it difficult for teams to break us down” showing. But just past the half-hour a wild and unnecessary attempt at an overhead clearance from the Australian Alanna Kennedy caught Brighton’s Aileen Whelan in the head and Inessa Kaagman rocketed the ball in to equalise from the spot.Spurs, though, were dominant and Morgan looked to be starting to settle and find her fitness on her return from the US camp in the Netherlands. Making her second start, and fourth appearance, the two-times World Cup winner forced a fine save from Walsh towards the close of the first half.As energy started to sap, Brighton saw more of the ball and had the odd chance. Fliss Gibbons’s long-range effort did not having enough power, though.Morgan had the ball in the net at the far post in the second half but was flagged offside, and it would be the 20-year-old Addison who edged Spurs towards victory, the forward going on a driving, dribbling run, skipping round Walsh and slotting coolly home.Morgan would finally score to ease nerves after Kaagman rattled the bar. Victoria Williams shoved Ria Percival and Morgan slotted in the penalty. There were high-fives all round and it would be her last action she retired to the stands with the other substitutes before turning round and asking her husband, Servando Carrasco, whether he had missed her first goal since the World Cup and pregnancy as he bounced a grumpy baby Charlie up and down.The win lifts Tottenham to ninth, doubles their points tally, and suddenly things don’t look quite so bleak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9418e2c633d0dfda64cfb4afd334083d8179b10b/0_24_3564_2138/master/3564.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=876a6a8cc9464eafff26dac37f037181","title":"premier league 10 talking points from the weekend action","story":"Another resurgent Frenchman for Chelsea, Mourinho has Kane purring and there was a Zaha masterclass to savourThere were long years when it seemed José Mourinho had lost his touch as a man motivator of star players. At Real Madrid, relations broke down with the club’s galácticos his alliance with Cristiano Ronaldo was lukewarm at best. Second time around at Chelsea, there was frostiness with Eden Hazard, while Paul Pogba and Mourinho cold-shouldered each other at Manchester United. At Tottenham, Mourinho made it his business to get close to Harry Kane, and the results have been scintillating. In the same style that Mourinho made Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba into Premier League greats, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic flourished at Internazionale, Kane brims with self-assurance and brings the best from those around him. His partnership with Son Heung-min that supplied Spurs’ goals is perhaps the club’s finest since Alan Gilzean was nodding them down for Jimmy Greaves more than 50 years ago. John BrewinWhen a club appoint a manager with no experience, mistakes will be made and patience will be necessary. Mikel Arteta worked for Pep Guardiola, but there’s a difference between inheriting some of the best players ever, and inheriting, well, this. So Guardiola’s admiration for Arteta must be qualified: he has no idea what it takes to do Arteta’s job, never mind whether Arteta is capable of doing it. Arteta, though, is his own man, and might consider how he presents that. Belligerently bragging about how many crosses his team put in is not exculpatory when they’ve scored two goals – a penalty and a header from a corner – in seven league games, and though he often says the right things, it’s hard to detect any charisma in how he says them. He needs time, but he also needs to show players and fans why they should give it to him. Daniel HarrisFew could question the job Nuno Espírito Santo has done for Wolves, even allowing for the club being handed a significant leg-up by their owners’ close relationship with the super-agent Jorge Mendes. Nuno, Mendes’s first ever client, has made good use of the rich talent brought to the club. Here comes the “but”: Wolves would not be everybody’s idea of appointment viewing. They almost always play with the same caution and reserve their zen-like manager shows in his public appearances. At Liverpool, the plan was going well until Conor Coady got a little overexcited against his former club – one he has been linked with a return to – and allowed Mohamed Salah in to score. It was the champions and there was no Raúl Jiménez but it is still tempting to wonder just when Neto, João Moutinho, Rúben Neves and Daniel Podence will be allowed to fully express themselves. JBLiverpool may have lost Virgil van Dijk – and what seems like 3,679 others – to injury, but they remain second in the league and favourites for the title, with good reason: the squad are settled, have the best manager around, and are always good for a goal. But perhaps the biggest difference between them and the rest is one of attitude. They don’t go into games hoping to win or expecting to win, they go into games knowing they’ll win – and the majority of times, they do. So though they took on Wolves – one of the Premier League’s most awkward opponents – with only seven first-teamers and with Fabinho playing out of position, it was no great surprise to see them ease to victory. Of course their best players are better than Wolves’ best players, but the authority with which they established their superiority was not a factor of talent but a factor of mentality. DHThis was an afternoon waltz wherein Crystal Palace shared the load but it is impossible to escape the reality that they are a different proposition with Wilfried Zaha in the team. Eberechi Eze was cute in possession and Patrick van Aanholt gallivanted down the left flank, while Jeffrey Schlupp was busy and Christian Benteke, too, was quietly efficient in attack. Hodgson expects Jordan Ayew and Michy Batshuayi, both of whom were introduced off the bench in victory at West Brom, to knock down the door of his office before hosting Tottenham on Sunday, but it is Zaha who makes them sing. After having a hand in four of Palace’s five strikes at the Hawthorns, he has now scored or assisted 10 of their 16 goals this season. “He is difficult to stop because he has excellent feet,” Hodgson said. “But what he has worked hard to add is goalscoring. If Wilf can keep that up it bodes very well for us.” Ben FisherMatch report: West Brom 1-5 Crystal PalaceSébastien Haller was one of West Ham’s best players against Manchester United: a constant threat in the air, tirelessly pressing, creating space for his teammates with clever movement. Alternatively, Haller missed a golden opportunity to put West Ham 2-0 up just before half-time when he rounded the goalkeeper and then slipped over. The 6ft 3in Ivorian international has ided opinion among West Ham fans since his £45m move in July 2019 and this was not a game to settle the debate. Haller has looked much better this season than last: busier, more confident, more involved in buildup, more like the all-round striker he was at Eintracht Frankfurt. And yet: nine goals in 42 games is not why he was brought to east London. Haller may well come good with time. But with the January window looming, there’s no guarantee he’ll get it. Jonathan LiewGareth Southgate must have enjoyed his afternoon, watching two England goalkeepers right at the top of their game. Both Jordan Pickford and Nick Pope produced a succession of excellent stops to keep the scores level and leave each Everton and Burnley a little disappointed with just a point, and there seems little doubt that as shot-stoppers the pair have few domestic equals. What Southgate might have noticed, though, was that Pickford, presently his first choice, struggled a little at crosses and corners, often grateful to have someone as tall as Yerry Mina to reach the ball and head away the danger.

That is almost double the number in October 2019, when there were 340,220 northern claimants.But the government’s “one size fits all” approach to compensating affected areas takes no account of the fact the UK entered the global pandemic with deep, growing ides between and within England’s regions caused by decades of centralisation and 10 years of austerity, IPPR North said.“Covid-19 makes the challenge of reducing regional inequalities even greater than before – especially for a government whose election platform rested heavily on a promise to do just that. ‘Levelling up’ is the latest in a long history of initiatives that refer loosely to regional rebalancing … to date, however, it is also one of the most striking for its lack of detail on how rebalancing is to be achieved,” the IPPR North’s report says.A £4bn levelling up fund for England was announced last month, to pay for “local infrastructure that has a visible impact on people and their communities”.“Unfortunately this will be a centrally administered fund, thereby missing an opportunity to strengthen devolution, build on the local knowledge and expertise of combined and local authorities,” IPPR North says.Covid has affected the health, livelihoods and future prospects of people in different ways, depending on where they live. It has “created new regional inequalities and deepened old isions”, the report adds.But there are fewer job opportunities in the north compared with the rest of England, IIPR North found, with 0.7 jobs per person in the north, lower than the English average (0.74 jobs per person).In addition, median wages are lower in the north than England as a whole, with 5 million northern workers paid less than the real living wage.The director of IPPR North, Sarah Longlands said: “Our regional ides are severe and growing, we face a climate emergency, and Brexit is just around the corner, so a recovery from Covid-19 that simply restores the status quo – which has failed so many northerners – would be unacceptable.“We need to challenge old, reductive assumptions about our economy because they’ve failed to create the conditions for a good life for everyone in the north. In particular, we have to stop assuming that the centre knows best and commit once and for all to a clear programme of regional devolution in England. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past … This is a wake-up call. Is the government listening?”An Treasury spokesperson said: “Recovering from coronavirus is the biggest challenge the UK has faced in living memory and we can’t shy away from the fact our national recovery will be difficult. But we are totally committed to levelling up opportunities across the whole of the UK as we build back better.“Whilst we have taken unprecedented action to protect jobs through the furlough scheme we have also taken significant steps with new investment in green technologies to create thousands of high-quality jobs in the north, setting out plans for freeports, and investing £100bn in infrastructure to boost growth.“Our new £4bn levelling up fund will support the fabric of everyday life, including high streets and train stations. The Treasury is also reforming the green book, which appraises the funding of projects, to focus on regional impact, as well as plans to open a new Treasury office and our new UK infrastructure bank in the north in the coming year.“The civil service has committed to relocating 22,000 civil service roles outside of London and the south-east, as well as a step change in investment in skills to boost people’s chances of success wherever they live.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dea521ed870cedd162695c6f324c78529382496/360_0_3425_2055/master/3425.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=03a45179433890120030f39573efd3e0","title":"tell us what are your best tips for recovering from a hangover","story":"We’d like to hear your tips for avoiding a sore head in the morningChristmas and New Year celebrations will take place on a much smaller scale in 2020 – but that doesn’t guarantee they’ll be hangover-free.

And with this funding, Roxi is ready to start to roll out on other platforms and in other countries.”The funding round, the first to bring on an institutional investor, includes figures such as Henrik Holmark, the former finance chief at the music service Pandora, and Chris Wright, the founder of Chrysalis Records. Other backers include Lorna Tilbian, the chairman of Dowgate Capital and a former board member at the ad group M\u0026ampC Saatchi, and Roxi’s chairman, Rupert Howell, a former senior executive at ITV and the publisher of the Mirror.Existing investors include the McLaren Group founder, Ron Dennis, and Paul McGuinness, the former manager of U2.If Roxi can hit its growth targets it is understood to be looking to make an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 2022. Interest is booming in businesses attempting to tap into the music streaming phenomenon, with the world’s three biggest labels – Universal Music, Warner Music and Sony Music – also shareholders in Roxi.Hipgnosis, a London-listed firm offering investors the chance to cash in on the royalties from songs by artists from Bon Jovi to Beyoncé, has raced to a £1bn valuation. In August the British music tech startup MelodyVR, which films and streams gigs fans watch with virtual reality headsets, bought the streaming pioneer Napster with the aim of creating a “truly next-generation music service”.Edward Spencer-Churchill, the co-founder and partner of Sun Capital Partners, said: “We are excited by Roxi’s opportunity to deliver unique, fun music entertainment experiences into the home.

We have not been given further details yet.Perhaps constituents will get the chance to ask him about their local hospital, Hillingdon hospital. On Friday a report from the Care Quality Commission rated it as inadequate.This is from Eric Mamer, the European commission’s chief spokesman 5pm in Brussels time is 4pm in London.On Saturday No 10 and the European commission said today’s call would take place “on Monday evening”.A temporary contraflow is to be set up on the A55 on Anglesey in north Wales to hold lorries that are turned away from the port of Holyhead from 1 January, the Welsh government has said.HGVs turned away from the port will be stacked while they sort their paperwork or redirected to other sites if there is space.A business park on the island is being prepared as a stacking site and should be ready by mid January and the government is also negotiating to use a truck stop. The Welsh transport and North Wales minister Ken Skates said: Introducing a contraflow is not something we want to do but it has become the necessary thing to do. The uncertainty we face means we have to take every step to protect the port and town of Holyhead from disruption.A former court of appeal judge has been appointed to lead a review into how the Human Rights Act (HRA) is being interpreted in UK courts, my colleague Owen Bowcott reports.The review will run alongside a parallel review of the way judicial review operates.Lawyers have been worried about the government’s plans for human rights law, particularly after it emerged in March that Boris Johnson was refusing to commit to applying the European convention on human rights as part of a UK-EU trade deal.But today, in its news release about the new review, the Ministry of Justice stresses that the government remains committed to the ECHR. It says:The UK remains committed to the European convention on human rights. The review is limited to looking at the structural framework of the Human Rights Act, rather than the rights themselves.Penny Mordaunt, who as paymaster general serves as a minister in the Cabinet Office, will respond to the urgent question on Brexit (see 11.03am), No 10 has said.Some readers have been asking why so little is being said this morning about the Commons debate on the internal market bill this afternoon? If the government reinserts the clauses allowing it to overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement (in breach of international law), doesn’t that crush all prospects of a trade deal? And why isn’t the EU saying so explicitly, as the pro-European Labour peer Andrew Adonis was yesterday?The bill remains a stumbling block, but this evening’s vote will not be the final word. If MPs do vote to reinsert the offending clauses into the bill, it doesn’t become law automatically. The bill will return to the Lords on Wednesday and peers are likely to remove them again. (The government lost the first ision last month by 268 votes.) So the government still has time to abandon these aspects of the bill as part of an overall trade agreement. (Some of them would become redundant anyway one involves giving the UK government a say over tariffs for goods that might be heading for the EU market, but under a free trade deal there would be no tariffs.)It is thought that Michael Gove is likely to be discussing this with Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission vice-president, in Brussels today. Gove and Šefčovič are co-chairs of the joint committee, the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement. Earlier I said they were attending a meeting of the committee. That’s wrong. It is actually a political meeting outside the formal joint committee process. They will “discuss issues related to their work as co-chairs of the joint committee”, the Cabinet Office said.And why is the EU not vocally insisting this morning that the offending clauses in the internal market bill will go? Out of tact. It wants a deal, it knows the UK government understands its objections, but it also accepts that it would be easier for Boris Johnson to drop the contentious provisions in the bill seemingly as a gesture of goodwill, rather than as an obvious climbdown forced by the EU.There are two urgent questions in the Commons today, one of which covers the end of the post-Brexit transition and is addressed to Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister. But Gove is in Brussels for a meeting, and so one of his ministerial colleagues is more likely to be replying.James Cleverly has also condemned as “completely wrong” Millwall fans who booed players for taking the knee at the weekend, while saying this did not denote support for the political aims of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.The comments by Cleverly, a Foreign Office minister who was formerly the Conservative party chair, contrast with the view of George Eustice, the environment secretary, who declined to criticise the Millwall fans’ behaviour yesterday.Some of the 2,000 fans of the south London club, attending a home game for the first time this season, loudly booed the knee-taking, adopted by players in English football this season in solidarity with victims of racial injustice.Asked about this on Sunday, Eustice said BLM was “a political movement that is different to what most of us believe in”, and did not condemn the booing.But speaking on LBC Radio, Cleverly said the players were “acting in a way that demonstrates solidarity with those people fighting racism and those who have been the victims of racism. Booing that is completely wrong, I’m totally comfortable saying that.”But Cleverly added that he thought existing anti-racism campaigns in football should be given more exposure, saying BLM were “pushing a very extreme political agenda”.James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister, sought to adopt a reassuring tone as he answered questions about the UK-EU trade talks when doing the morning broadcast round on behalf of No 10 this morning. Here are the key points from his various interviews.The vast majority of the elements of this agreement have been resolved and we’re now hanging on a small number of important areas where we don’t have agreement.We’re nearly there but we are not quite there yet. And it may well be that we will not be able to resolve this in the timescale we’ve got, but we’re nearly there.Whilst it would’ve been lovely to get something earlier than this, it’s not completely surprising that it’s going to the wire but we’ll keep negotiating hard on behalf of the British people to get a good trade agreement.I think a deal is possible and we’ll keep working towards it until we get it.Outside the EU we can actually sign trade agreements more quickly with more countries than previously, so we do indeed hold all the cards.I think if the EU recognise this they will see that actually making a few small but significant concessions can get this deal done and that will be in their interest and in our interest.Countries can trade perfectly well without a formal trade agreement, as Australia does with the EU, There have been people trying to paint the idea of us leaving without a trade agreement as some kind of Armageddon. It is less preferable than having a trade agreement but ... you can trade successfully with the EU without a formal trade agreement.Yesterday ITV’s Robert Peston reported on the contents of a government document setting out the “reasonable worst case” for what no-deal might involve. The scenario may not involve Armageddon, but it’s not that far off either. There is a link here.This is from Nigel Farage, who as Ukip leader was instrumental in creating the conditions that led to the UK voting to leave the EU in 2016. He currently leads the Brexit party, which is struggling to find a role in UK politics now that the Conservative party is associated with a hard Brexit position.(Quite why he is conflating the migrant boats issue with the trade negotiation isn’t clear, other than to insinuate that the French are inherently unreasonably.)RTE’s Europe editor, Tony Connelly, has posted a thread on Twitter with the full comments from Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, this morning.Here are some more reports from reporters who cover Brussels on what happened when Michel Barnier briefed EU diplomats this morning.From my colleague Daniel BoffeyFrom the Wall Street Journal’s Laurence NormanFrom the Independent’s Jon StoneThe pound is down this morning following reports that the UK-EU trade talks are not making progress, Bloomberg reports.Sky News doorstepped Lord Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, in Brussels this morning as he arrived for the latest round of meetings. When asked what was happening, all he would say was that he was still “working very hard”.Good morning. After numerous false starts (and apologies for any reporting on this that may have been misleading), we have finally, finally arrived at what will be the decisive week for the UK-EU trade talks, or even the decisive 2448 hours. Or at least that’s Whitehall consensus. A deal agreed in the next day or so could be approved by the EU summit starting on Thursday and then rushed through parliament next week. Other timetables would be conceivable, but much more problematic.Here is our overnight story on the talks.This morning Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has been updated EU ambassadors in Brussels on developments. Here is the latest updated filed by Reuters within the last few minutes.British and European Union negotiators have still not bridged gaps on the three main issues standing in the way of a post-Brexit trade deal and the talks could still go either way, an EU diplomat said on Monday.Despite intensive negotiations until late last night, the gaps on level playing field, governance and fisheries are still not bridged. The outcome is still uncertain, it can still go both ways,” the diplomat said.He was speaking after a briefing for EU member states’ ambassadors to Brussels by the bloc’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier.“EU-UK negotiations have entered the endgame, time is running out quickly,” the diplomat said. “The EU is ready to go the extra mile to agree on a fair, sustainable and balanced deal for citizens in the EU and UK. It is for the UK to chose between such a positive outcome or a no deal outcome.”And these are from RTE’s Europe editor, Tony Connelly.Here is the agenda for the day.12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold a lobby briefing.12.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is expected to hold a coronavirus briefing.12.15pm: Vaughan Gething, the Welsh health minister, holds a coronavirus briefing.After 3.30pm: MPs resume their debate on the internal market bill. The government is reinserting the clauses taken out in the House of Lords allowing the UK to over-rule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement.Early evening: Boris Johnson is due to hold talks with Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, about the UK-EU trade talks.Also, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission vice president, are holding a meeting in Brussels. They are co-chairs of the joint committee, the body set up to oversee the implementation of the withdrawal agreement.Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

But an hour before the start of play it became apparent this game was in doubt when neither team appeared at the ground.The announcement of a delayed start was then followed by the match’s full cancellation. Monday’s second ODI will not take place until Tuesday at the earliest, and the entire tour is in jeopardy. England still have an enlarged 18-man squad here – down from 23 during their 3-0 series win in the Twenty20s – and the new “best-case” scenario is described as two back-to-back 50-over matches at Newlands on Tuesday and Wednesday.Little is certain after England were told at 5pm on Saturday that two members of staff at the Vineyard hotel – the base for both teams – had tested positive for the virus, one of whom had been working in close contact with the tourists.The England camp was immediately tested again that evening and two positive results came back in the morning. All players and support staff were then forced to isolate in their rooms, although this was later relaxed to allow everyone bar the two positive cases some limited use of the outdoor areas.In the joint statement announcing the cancellation of the match, these were described as “unconfirmed positives” and it is understood that England’s medical lead on tour, Dr Moiz Moghal, has requested independent verification of the results.The two cases in question are reporting no symptoms and there is said to be a query over unusually high levels of viral load shown up in their respective PCR tests England’s suspicion here is that two false positives may have been returned.If the cases are confirmed following this new analysis, the two unnamed members of the touring party face a 10-day isolation period before being permitted to leave South Africa, pushing them beyond the team’s departure via charter flight on Thursday.Anyone deemed to be a close contact – at least 15 minutes face-to-face in the 48 hours before their latest round of tests – may also have to stay behind. The bulk of the squad are due a rare Christmas at home, although Lewis Gregory, Liam Livingstone, Tom Curran, Jason Roy and Sam Billings are meant to head to Australia for the Big Bash League.There remains an obvious will among the top-level administrators of both boards to get some more cricket played before the end of the tour. However the sense of unease at this prospect is growing.For Cricket South Africa, already struggling financially, a wiped out three-match series would see it lose an estimated £1.5m and threatens upcoming visits by Sri Lanka, Australia and Pakistan during this home season.The England and Wales Cricket Board, meanwhile, will be reluctant to abandon a tour early in response to a relatively small number of cases given the precedent this may set before a packed 2021 home summer that includes a lucrative visit by India.There is clear frustration, however, that after an English season which did not return a single positive test result during the visits of West Indies (men and women), Pakistan, Ireland and Australia, the biosecure set-up in South Africa has not worked. The first of the home side’s three positive cases was detected by initial screening on 18 November - before their players came together in Cape Town - with the second, two days after their arrival, believed to have been successfully isolated also.There was then a 10-day gap before a third player reported symptoms at the start of this apparent recent outbreak, leaving the hotel owners and CSA baffled as to how the integrity of the so-called bio-secure bubble had been compromised.The hotel staff have been staying on site throughout the tour, with the perimeter guarded by security and overseen by the Claremont police.The two squads cannot mix and there is a rota for common areas, which are cleaned in between usage.No one can enter or leave for matches or training unless in an assigned vehicle – the drivers also stay on site – and though golf has also been permitted at nearby Boschenmeer, players do not come into contact with outsiders and there are strict hygiene protocols in place.All hotel staff were retested on Saturday and returned a full set of negatives on Sunday. Further confusion comes from the fact that two positive staff members have been working in different designated zones throughout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ee85ff8c076aac7ff978f9ccd1a57b99ff081b/477_277_5244_3147/master/5244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f329c2b671f210e0a94e911d3609c19","title":"panto  how theatre cancellation affects local economy covid malvern","story":"Covid puts paid to Malvern staging Peter Pan – and a possible £500,000 at the box office – but there are wider implicationsIn a normal year, Malvern Theatres would now be in final rehearsals for its annual pantomime.This year it was due to be Peter Pan, the panto about the boy who refuses to grow up, and the curtain should have been going up on Thursday.But for the first time in two decades, the main 880-seat auditorium in the Worcestershire spa town’s theatre will not be echoing to the sound of hundreds of children shouting “he’s behind you”. Uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying restrictions prompted Malvern Theatres’ chief executive, Nic Lloyd, to decide back in May to cancel the year’s box office highlight.From a financial point of view, it was a difficult call – and one that will not only have an impact on the venue.

Without the Christmas season you have no chance of breaking even,” Lloyd says.“The panto is crucial for the theatre, as we are unsubsidised, but also for the local economy, to which the theatre is a huge contributor.”Last year’s show, Aladdin, played 34 performances from 12 December into January and almost 31,000 people went to see the show – more than the population of Great Malvern itself – and it grossed just shy of £500,000 at the box office.Pantos guarantee packed houses over several weeks – often supporting venues for the rest of the year – and generate more than £60m in annual revenue for Britain’s theatres, according to the trade association UK Theatre.For Malvern, unlike many other theatres, the loss of the panto will be a financial blow but not a mortal wound.The charitable trust that runs the Theatres has received a £971,000 grant from the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund, as well as donations from audience members, which Lloyd believes has secured its future until March next year.The town at the foot of the Malvern Hills is a perennial draw for walkers but it also boasts a rich cultural history, including 135 years of theatre performances on the current site.In more recent times, Malvern Theatres’ reputation has drawn audiences from Birmingham, Bristol and Wales, all about an hour’s drive away.And these visitors do not only support the venue. According to Sheffield University research for the Arts Council, the contribution of the Theatres to the local economy has been estimated at up to £21m a year.That comes as no surprise to local traders. “The panto pulls in people,” says Nigel Morris, rearranging Christmas decorations in his homeware shop, Rhubarb Home, down the road from the theatre. It is one of two shops he runs in the town with his wife Sara and son Jack.“There is a matinee, and an evening performance, so people get here earlier, grab a coffee and usually have an hour or so to kill in town,” he says.Despite the lack of panto, trade seemed to have bounced back after lockdown, says Morris, as he sells fairy lights and baubles to a steady stream of customers.Shopping for festive decorations on their lunch break, solicitors Victoria Knight and Emma Grantham say family trips to the pantomime are an essential part of the Christmas season. “I don’t tend to go to anything at the theatre but the panto,” Knight says.“It’s not going to be same this year,” says Tom Floyd, the owner of Abbey Road Coffee, a vegetarian cafe a few hundred metres from the theatre.Before coronavirus, the coffee shop was a popular haunt of the actors and technical staff working on productions. In the past few months, Floyd has noticed more customers in the morning but afternoons are quiet.AJ Bains is optimistic that in 2021 trade will return to the Mount Pleasant hotel he manages at the top of the town’s high street. But, for now, he is missing room and restaurant bookings from theatre patrons.“We do a pre-theatre menu normally, and we do really well out of it. We’d usually have quite a few covers booked,” Bains says.In a year without thousands of theatregoers, Malvern Hills district council is trying to boost trade in December and beyond, says Sarah Rouse, the leader of the council.“We are looking at what can we do in January because usually the panto rolls on until then,” she says. “It was very disappointing, everyone loves the panto, but the reaction was, what can we do to counter it?”The council has appointed a new staff member tasked with managing the town centre’s recovery from the pandemic, and extra Christmas markets have been booked.While there won’t be a pantomime dame gracing the stage, Malvern Theatres will not remain dark during the festive season. The foyer has been decked with fairy lights, and rehearsals have begun for a festive play, The Snow Goose, which will run over 70 minutes without an interval for four nights during December. It also plans some film screenings and a comedy magic show for kids."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f5f0fca41c9473e126bacb019c3029c367793ff/640_568_3149_1889/master/3149.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTUucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e00b7a532887c902dad7be103741bf9e","title":"amazon echo 2020 review the best sounding smart speaker under 100","story":"Pros: bass you can feel as well as hear, great sound, Spotify, native BBC radio, Alexa, Bluetooth, 3.5mm input, made of recycled materials, interesting design, AZ1 chip.Cons: potential privacy concerns of a smart speaker, Alexa-only, AZ1 chip not active outside US yet, general knowledge not quite as good as Google Assistant, wider footprint compared with cylinder design."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fa9d3ccd952ea5f3583ac25c7414871d6e7da7c/0_113_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e22aedc984ea6a91b09b161b3a95ba67","title":"biden options democrats republicans cabinet","story":"Transition team plans for possibility that Senate Republicans – depending on Georgia runoff contests – may aim to stonewallJoe Biden has had a fairly smooth cabinet appointment process so far, but there are rumblings that it could get choppier, and speculation that the Democratic president-elect may take a leaf out of the Donald Trump playbook to try to get the team he wants.Publicly, Democrats are hopeful that the confirmation processes for all of Biden’s cabinet nominees will go smoothly. But looming over the Biden team’s planning is the possibility that Republicans in the Senate decide to stonewall a nominee, blocking confirmation of anyone Biden puts forward.Their ability to do that will rest on who wins two Senate runoff races in Georgia. If Democrats win, they wrest control of the vital upper chamber away from Republicans. But if Republicans triumph, it raises the prospect they can stonewall any Biden nominee for a specific cabinet position.In that scenario, one option for Democrats would be to follow Donald Trump’s example and controversially install cabinet officials under the “acting” moniker, where they are not confirmed but serve in that role regardless.In the later period of his administration, Trump made a habit of appointing acting heads to federal agencies, thereby circumventing the usual confirmation process, even with Republicans controlling the Senate.“Frankly, it’s not an unhelpful precedent,” a Senate Democratic aide said of the idea of Biden appointing acting cabinet secretaries in the face of a Republican blockade.If Democrats control the Senate, the Senate majority will almost certainly move in lockstep to confirm Biden’s nominees as a demonstration of the incoming president’s promise to “lower the temperature” of American politics. If Republicans control the chamber, gumming up confirmations is a tempting way to generate leverage with a new president who has promised to work with the opposing party.It’s unclear which of Biden’s nominees Republicans will find most objectionable.So far, the most opposition Republicans have sounded on any of Biden’s nominees has been over Neera Tanden, the president of the progressive Center for American Progress. Biden nominated Tanden to run the Office of Management and Budget. Drew Brandewie, the communications director for the Texas senator John Cornyn, one of the highest-ranking Republicans in the Senate, tweeted that Tanden has “zero chance” of getting confirmed.The Ohio senator Rob Portman, a former OMB director, told reporters he supported a hearing for Tanden but that she is “problematic as a nominee, and I would hope the Biden administration would reconsider nominating her.”If Republicans retain control of the Senate, Portman will chair one of the committees that handles Tanden’s nomination.Republicans are expected to aggressively fight at least a few of Biden’s nominees, not just Tanden. Conservatives have already started to signal a critical interest in the dealings of the consulting firm the secretary of state nominee Tony Blinken helped co-found, WestExec Advisers.Biden transition team officials, congressional Democrats, and veterans of the process are hesitant to think about a worst-case scenario like a Senate blockade over multiple nominees. The Biden transition team has set a goal of meeting with every member of Congress, according to a Biden transition official. The team is also in the process of setting up meetings between nominees and senators, the official said, a sign that the incoming administration still hopes it can engineer some bipartisan support.“Over the course of just the last eight days, President-elect Biden has put forward a group of experienced and committed nominees who will rebuild our relationships in the world and build back our economy,” the Biden transition team spokesman, Sean Savett, said in a statement.He added: “The process of engaging with Democratic and Republican members and offices is already well under way and it will only pick up in the weeks ahead. While we fully expected disagreement with some members of the Senate, we have no doubt that the American people fully expect the consideration and confirmation of qualified nominees.”Phil Schiliro, the former White House director for legislative affairs during the Obama administration, said he expected the confirmation period for Biden’s nominees to be similar to past ones.“I don’t think it’ll be aberrational,” Schiliro said. “In part because we’ve just had an aberrational presidency where norms have been broken repeatedly, and I think there are Republican senators who have had a real problem with that whether they can articulate it or not is one thing. But there’s been a real norm where there comes to confirmations for the cabinet that’d be done expeditiously and professionally and I would expect that’s going to happen again.”The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the highest-ranking Republican official in the chamber, for example, broke longtime precedent on supreme court nominees when he refrained from allowing a hearing on Barack Obama’s pick of Merrick Garland. More recently, he went back on his own logic for refraining from holding hearings on Garland when Republicans quickly moved Amy Coney Barrett through the Senate’s hearings.In other words, there’s precedent for McConnell and the current crop of Republican leadership to buck longstanding Senate traditions. It’s also normal for a few cabinet nominees to not make it through the confirmation process.Schiliro noted though that Biden has a “history of good relationships with the Senate even though the Senate has changed a lot. There’s still a fair amount of members he has good relations with and there’s goodwill and trust.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8628b06d7fc8fd07bc5b112fc20778985ab1fc91/0_37_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a032bda6cefc1e645940161c61e2e02a","title":"are you getting the pfizer coronavirus vaccine this week in the uk","story":"We’d like to speak to people who are due to be given the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine in the coming daysThe Pfizer coronavirus vaccine is due to be rolled out in the UK this week, with the first people to receive doses on Tuesday.

Nor has the economic fallout been a leveller.”He called on the government to “get behind a proper examination of the issues of how Covid has impacted on inequality, particularly on the delivery of their levelling up agenda” and added: “It’s made the task harder of levelling up but also made it more urgent. And the truth is, we don’t have a levelling up plan from the government, we don’t have a cabinet minister … we simply don’t have a level of leadership with this agenda.”The link between deprivation, ethnicity and an increased risk from Covid-19 has been well established, with black African men nearly four times more likely to die from the disease than white men, according to the UK’s Office for National Statistics. analysis shows for the first time how these disparities exist even among communities living side by side. It drills down to more than 300 neighbourhoods comprising nearly 2.7 million people in England’s 10 local authorities with the highest infection rates, almost all of which are post-industrial towns in the north-west.It found that across England, average salary was likely to indicate an area’s infection rate, meaning places with higher average earnings were more likely to have fewer Covid-19 cases. But in the 10 worst-hit local authorities, an area’s proportion of BAME residents had a stronger correlation to its case rate, compared with salary, age and deprivation.In these 10 worst-hit councils, the 26 areas with a majority of BAME residents and an average salary of below £25,000 had experienced 7.1 cases per 100 people. This is almost double the average rate in the 22 mostly white areas where most people earn more than £35,000 a year.Tim Elwell-Sutton, an assistant director of the Health Foundation, described the findings as “very stark”: “You’re seeing areas right next to each other having very different experiences of the pandemic and that bring things home.”Residents from a BAME background are more likely to live in cramped housing with several generations under one roof, working in public-facing jobs in healthcare, hospitality or warehouses, and are more likely to use public transport, experts have said, increasing their exposure to Covid-19.“At least in part, these factors are a consequence of structural racism and it has left ethnic minorities more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic and could have been predicted,” said Elwell-Sutton.He urged ministers to put health inequalities at the heart of the government’s levelling up agenda, arguing that the focus on infrastructure and the economy risked leaving structural issues as “the preserve of the Department of Health”.He added: “If we’d been healthier at the start of the pandemic we would have done much better and particularly if that gap between the most and least deprived wasn’t as big then we would have found it easier to weather this.”Kerslake said the government needed to invest not only in infrastructure but also skills and combating deprivation, and properly fund local authorities to rebuild public health capacity. “If you were to pick out one thing that left us much more vulnerable to this pandemic it has been the denuding of resources for public health and local authorities,” he said. A failure to do so posed a “real risk” that existing health inequalities would widen, he warned.Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen council, said his area had suffered a “double whammy pandemic effect”, which he said was worsening the health and economic costs.Residents and businesses urgently needed more financial help from the Treasury, he said, adding that more deprived areas to be prioritised for the vaccine when it is rolled out more widely early next year. He called for a longer-term plan to move new middle class jobs to struggling northern towns post-Brexit.“The inequalities revealed by this analysis absolutely confirm our own local analysis,” he said.“We have higher Covid rates due to higher structural risks, so we risk being in tier 3 for longer, possibly months, and so our local economy is massively more impacted. This increases deprivation which is itself a major driver of higher rates of Covid-19 transmission.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/370b661c1c9941e1a64d9188f4972d7d14572248/0_361_6720_4035/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e0e058e4a5763ccd54d2502b7bc04b4","title":"england inequality covid infection rates blackburn","story":"While local authority has highest infection rate, cases are not spread equally – and ethnicity is key factorFrom his fishmongers in the Blackburn suburb of Bastwell, Zohar Mahaldar sees and hears it all. “It’s getting very frustrating,” he said. He can’t quite believe how many people he has to shoo out of the shop for not wearing a mask, despite Blackburn having the highest overall Covid-19 infection rate in the UK.People don’t want to take responsibility for their own health, he complained. “They say, ‘but it’s written by the almighty!’ They think if it’s Allah’s will, he will protect them. But I say to them: ‘Allah also gave you a brain’.” It’s suicide not taking Covid seriously, he said: “And suicide is haram in our religion. It is not allowed.”On Monday, one of Mahaldar’s neighbours died from Covid-19. In November, he himself contracted Covid – a dangerous proposition for a man who had five heart attacks in 2018. He was fine after three days but his wife and teenage daughter suffered longer: “I still hear people saying it’s just flu, but I know that’s not true.”One in 10 people in Bastwell have so far tested positive for coronavirus during the pandemic, more than anywhere else in Blackburn. Despite a mammoth local testing effort, cases in this tightly packed neighbourhood continue to cause concern. Last week there were 32 cases, the equivalent of 427 per 100,000 people, almost three times the English national average.Blackburn with Darwen has seen the highest Covid-19 infection rate of any local authority in the UK this year, but cases are not spread equally across this hilly pocket of post-industrial Lancashire. In some communities – the whitest, wealthiest ones – there have been a quarter of the infections seen in Bastwell, proving that while Covid-19 can hit both prime ministers and paupers, it is not a great leveller.On Thursday afternoon Louisa Lord, who owns Tockholes stables as well as working as a pharmaceutical dispenser, was taking 22-year-old Hector, a handsome Highland pony, for a trot. She was unsurprised to hear that her village had the lowest infection rates in Blackburn, with the equivalent of three in every 100 residents testing positive.“It’s much easier to isolate up here and keep your distance,” she said. “We are very lucky.” Dave Watson, a retired teacher out for a walk, agreed. Did they think Tockholes folk were more careful or just luckier to have more space? Bit of both, they thought. “When you go down to Blackburn and see people not wearing masks and not bothering to sanitise or meeting in groups it does upset me because we are doing our bit,” said Lord. But she didn’t think Tockholes should be treated differently or released from tier 3 ahead of Bastwell. “We’re in it together,” she said.Mohammed Khan, Blackburn’s Labour council leader, blames 10 years of austerity for increasing “structural inequalities” in Blackburn. But he accepts that in South Asian-majority communities, such as Bastwell, high Covid rates “can be attributed more to cultural reasons than those of poverty – if one person gets infected in a multigenerational household, all the household members are getting infected. We also have a lot of people from these communities working on the frontline in health and social care, domiciliary care as well as in professions such as taxi drivers.”Back over in Bastwell, Hanna Malluk, a nail technician, was handing out flyers for her new beauty business. She has had Covid, along with her husband and four young daughters. Some employers in Blackburn aren’t taking the virus seriously enough, she said: “They let the rules slip.” She knows people who have been pressurised to go to work in factories when they had symptoms and they complied, unable to afford to self-isolate. “It’s not just employers, it’s employees who need to stand up for themselves and do the right thing,” she said.Many local people have made big sacrifices to keep themselves and others safe. Khadim Hussain’s wife died four months ago and he now lives alone, never leaving the house other than to cross the road to his shed, where he was painting a new banister on Thursday. His daughter leaves shopping at his doorstep and he has not hugged his 14-year-old granddaughter for many months. “My granddaughter is my heartbeat. I would so love to hug her, I always say, ‘when I see you, my body fills with two pints of blood.’ But I am scared.”He suggested young people were flouting the rules, meeting in large groups: “There’s this total disregard. They must have parents, grandparents. My wife recently passed on and when I went to her grave there were a lot of new graves in the Muslim sector.”Yet in many parts of Bastwell a sense of fatalism remains. Sitting behind the counter in his corner shop, Asid Bage talked of the importance in the Asian community of seeing family, believing many people were still seeing relatives from other households. He had been worried about catching Covid at the beginning of the pandemic. Now, though: “I leave it for god. It’s my livelihood. I can’t afford to close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5506bbae024e5c47d71ee00f322709e58a5daf83/295_239_2075_1245/master/2075.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9a04545857594ac54e3d0f4d2249f557","title":"coronavirus live news giuliani tests positive for covid california braces for lockdown","story":"California confirmed record new cases on Sunday South Korea expands testing amid case surge Biden picks California Attorney General Becerra to lead pandemic responseSchools, restaurants and courts in Greece will not reopen until 7 January, the government’s spokesman Stelios Petsas has said.Greece was forced to impose a nationwide lockdown in November, its second this year, after an aggressive rise in Covid-19 cases.

The number of new Covid-19 infections per day in France is unlikely to fall to a 5,000 target by 15 December as the population is not sufficiently respecting social distancing measures, one of France*s top coronavirus experts said today.Eric Caumes, head of infectious diseases at Paris hospital La Pitié-Salpêtrière, told LCI television that if the French are not cautious enough over Christmas and year-end holidays, it will lead to a third wave of the virus in mid-January.President Emmanuel Macron has said the French lockdown that started on 30 October could be lifted on 15 December, if by then the number of new infections per day has fallen to 5,000.“No, I do not think this target can be reached as the trend downward stopped, it is stabilising. So it will be difficult to reach that target,” Caumes said.French health authorities reported 11,022 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from the 12,923 new infections detected the previous day.It’s back to school today for some New York City schoolchildren, weeks after the schools were closed to in-person learning because of rising Covid-19 infections.The city’s public school system, which shut down in-person learning earlier this month, will bring back preschool students and children in kindergarten through fifth grade, whose parents chose a mix of in-school and remote learning. Special education students in all grades who have particularly complex needs will be welcomed back starting Thursday.Middle school and high school will remain all remote at least until after the holiday break, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said.We have facts now for two straight months of extraordinarily low levels of transmission in our schools, our schools are clearly safer. This is what our health care leaders say. Our schools are safer than pretty much any place else in New York City. So, I really think everyone in the school community can feel secure because so many measures are in place to protect everyone.De Blasio announced on 29 November that school buildings serving younger children and special-needs students would reopen with coronavirus testing increased from monthly to weekly. Masks and social distancing are required at all city schools.About 190,000 students will be eligible to return to school buildings starting today. After closing schools in March, New York City was one of the first large US cities to reopen school buildings in September, but the majority of parents chose online-only learning for their children.Children whose parents chose the hybrid model were previously inside physical classrooms from one to three days a week, but de Blasio said some students will now be in their school buildings five days a week.That’s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along – and stay tuned for the latest with my colleague Haroon Siddique. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Some of England’s most ethnically erse areas have suffered up to four times more coronavirus infections than mostly white neighbourhoods only a few miles away, a  analysis reveals, as health experts said the UK had paid the price for failing to tackle structural racism.A study of England’s 10 worst-hit council areas found huge disparities in the effect of Covid-19 on residents living alongside one another, with densely packed Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities bearing the brunt of the pandemic.The World Health Organization is holding discussions on Monday about the feasibility of trials in which healthy young volunteers are deliberately infected with coronavirus to hasten vaccine development – amid questions over whether they should go ahead given the promising data from the frontrunner vaccine candidates.Some scientists have reservations about exposing volunteers to a virus for which there is no cure, although there are treatments that can help patients. However, proponents argue that the risks of Covid-19 to the young and healthy are minimal, and the benefits to society are high: Indonesia received its first shipment of coronavirus vaccine from China on Sunday, President Joko Widodo said, as the government prepares a mass inoculation programme. The vaccine still needs to be evaluated by the country’s food and drug agency while his administration prepares to distribute it across the vast archipelago of 270 million people, Jokowi said.Britain is set to administer the first doses of the PfizerBioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday, with the NHS giving top priority to vaccinating the over-80s, frontline healthcare workers and care home staff and residents, Reuters reports. The PfizerBioNTech vaccine needs to be kept at -70C (-94F) and only lasts five days in a regular fridge. For that reason, it will first be administered in 50 hospitals. About 800,000 doses are expected to be available within the first week.Provincial governments across China are placing orders for experimental, domestically made coronavirus vaccines, though health officials have yet to say how well they work or how they may reach the country’s 1.4 billion people, AP reports. Developers are speeding up final testing, the Chinese foreign minister said during a US meeting last week, as Britain approved emergency use of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine candidate and providers scrambled to set up distribution.Even without final approval, more than 1 million health care workers and others in China who are deemed at high risk of infection have received experimental vaccines under emergency use permission. Developers have yet to disclose how effective their vaccines are and possible side effects.China’s fledgling pharmaceutical industry has at least five vaccines from four producers being tested in more than a dozen countries including Russia, Egypt and Mexico. Health experts say even if they are successful, the certification process for the United States, Europe, Japan and other developed countries might be too complex for them to be used there.However, China said it will ensure the products are affordable for developing countries and has been actively pursuing deals across the world.A plea from Dr. Anthony Fauci for people to “wear a mask” to slow the spread of the coronavirus tops a Yale Law School librarian’s list of the most notable quotes of 2020.The list assembled by Fred Shapiro, an associate director at the library, is an annual update to “The Yale Book of Quotations,” which was first published in 2006, AP reports.

It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat. As much as 70 per cent of Irish consumers’ virtual spending leaves the country as people shop overseas.It doesn’t have to be that way. As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies. That would save jobs and keep businesses going.So our 100 became 200, and is now becoming 400.Jump to: Toys Food and drink Art and gifts Jewellery Clothes Books Music and tech Sporty stuff Health and beauty Everything elseTOYS nimblefingers.ie  A Dublin toyshop that has been making children and their parents happy for generations.

Video: Bryan O’Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTina Tulley, manager at the An Post Dublin Parcel Hub in Dublin 12. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienSomeone in Lucan is getting an electric scooter for Christmas. It arrived by ship from Poland early on Thursday morning and found its way to An Post’s mail centre campus – two large warehouses near Ballymount, west Dublin, where 3.3 million packages are now being sorted and sent every week.Over the next 24 hours, the scooter in its packaging will be unloaded, wind its way along a complex carousel system and be placed inside another truck and brought to the Parkwest staging centre before finally arriving at a front-door destination some time on Friday morning.It is the journey of just one parcel. But take your eye off it for a split second and it becomes lost in a sea of brown and white cardboard, countless thousands of tonnes of which are trundling through the postal system in the build-up to a Christmas that, due to the pandemic, is more reliant on postal delivery than ever before.On a steel gantry overlooking the sprawling machinery (An Post has invested €30 million in its “ecommerce campus”), floor operations manager Maurice Ebbs (51) is as enthusiastic about the process as the children will be about the presents on Christmas morning.“There has been unbelievable change,” he says. “The volumes in the last couple of years it’s probably more than trebled.”He knows all about change. As a 16-year-old junior postman in the mid-1980s, he started out delivering telegrams from the back of a motorbike.In many ways that encapsulates where An Post is today – with letters ever dwindling, growing volumes of smaller consumer packages, ordered online, represent the future. At the mail centre, they funnel by at high speed around a spaghetti junction of conveyor belts, scanners and bins that fill much of the 45,000sq ft of noisy warehouse space.As Ebbs mentions, this year’s weekly seasonal throughput is more than triple the previous record of one million packages set last year.A quick glimpse among the huge pallets and boxes reveals Christmas gifts and deliveries from the likes of Zara, Arnotts, Hampers \u0026amp Co, and HP Nutrition. Amazon arrows are omnipresent. A vast array of random consumer goods – everything from guitars and bags of barbecue coals to surfboards and trampolines – fill two kilometres worth of trucks, back to back, on a daily basis.Things “start” at 7am but never really stop – there is just a two-hour window for machine maintenance.Full trucksRoss Tredt (36), a process area manager who oversees the trucks, says there has been “no let-up” through the pandemic. The trucks he oversees reverse up and pull away every 20-30 minutes, each holding 2,000-5,000 packages. They never stop.Does he dream about parcels? “Nightmares! It’s just been non-stop.”But the pandemic has been a tale of two postal systems for chief executive David McRedmond.“The really good news, though, is strategically it’s moved us forward about two or three years. We were going to go through this gradual decline in letters and gradual increase in parcels instead you have just seen a jump – like that. So we are now really operating where we would have expected to operate in, say, 2023.”All around him the shiny new machines are purring and wheezing to keep up with this abrupt fast-forward. From the trucks, parcels are fed on to a series of connecting conveyor belts, slowed and evenly spaced by human hands before being funnelled through a scanner, which records the barcodes, and then tipped into destination-specific bins.These in turn are loaded on to yet more trucks and dispatched to 113 delivery depots around the country. Much of the process is automated, a far cry from the human handling of 10 years ago that would, says director of international mail Cyril McGrane, have potentially added another 24 hours to delivery times.Today they process up to 12,000 parcels an hour – compared with 1,000 in the manual days – which on Wednesday alone added up to a total of 167,000.“It’s mind-blowing scale change,” says McGrane, who predicts the surge in activity will last well into the January sales.Fish gutsIt is not all pristine Amazon packages and square boxes. Paula Robinson and Donna Nolan work in the international section, unloading the one or two trucks that arrive from the airport at 6am each morning.They work closely with customs officers and have encountered everything from second-hand clothes to “bush meat”, fish guts and any manner of rotten food products that “ooze out” and destroy neighbouring parcels.“Some days we have to go home and fumigate ourselves,” Paula laughs, although like everyone else they describe their job with a certain affection. Even bizarre Christmas gifts have a home to reach.Over the next year An Post plans to adapt its systems for ever more efficiency, moving the emphasis further away from letters. But McRedmond is keen to bring the public along, and savvy PR moves during the pandemic have helped (the idea of distributing five million free postcards last March was based on similar St Patrick’s Day versions once gifted by Senator Feargal Quinn).“We became very motivated by really being a front line in the pandemic, and in relation to how people think about An Post, I think it has changed it,” he says.But will the old romanticism of the village postman delivering letters be pushed aside by a tide of ruthless automated efficiency? “I think we want to achieve both,” McRedmond replies.“It’s a really important part of what An Post is, that human connection. So we’ll always have postmen and postwomen, we will always have them.“But they’ll now be in an electric van they’ll now be calling at different times of the day they’ll now be on slightly different routes. So, yes, there will be changes but for the consumer, for the person living at home, they’ll still know their postman or postwoman. That’s really important but the whole system behind them will be completely different.”"},{"url":null,"title":"class gap more affluent students dominate high points courses","story":"The class gap in higher education is revealed in new figures that show affluent students dominate high-points courses such as medicine, finance and engineering.By contrast, students from disadvantaged areas are more likely to study courses in areas such as childcare, sport and secretarial studies.The findings are contained in new research by the Higher Education Authority (HEA), which examines the socio-economic profile of tens of thousands of students attending universities and institutes of technology.The study also reveals striking contrasts in the profile of students attending inidual third-level institutions.Trinity College Dublin has the highest proportion of students from affluent areas (36 per cent) and the lowest proportion of disadvantaged students (5 per cent).It is followed closely behind by other Dublin institutes, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and UCD.By contrast, Letterkenny Institute of Technology has the highest proportion of students from disadvantaged areas (25 per cent).In general, institutes of technology were more likely to represent the local community in their student intake, while there was a more affluent student profile in the university sector.Using the new data, colleges will be rewarded with additional public funding if they admit more disadvantaged students.This year, for example, colleges received about €42 million for measures to support students from target groups to access and participate in higher education.Overall, across the higher education system, students from affluent backgrounds are over-represented while students from disadvantaged backgrounds are under-represented.This class gap is likely to raise questions over whether our system of grants and access schemes is generous enough to support students from worse-off backgrounds into higher education.The findings are based on deprivation index scores, which measure the relative affluence or disadvantage of a student’s home address.The report covers all publicly funded higher-education institutions for the first time and 94 per cent of third-level students.Lack of ersityDr Alan Wall, the authority’s chief executive, said the figures showed the higher-education student population did not yet reflect the ersity found in the rest of the population in Ireland.“This detailed data set provides policy makers and institutions with a comprehensive knowledge of patterns of access and disadvantage that will assist them in developing and implementing targeted approaches to advancing equity of access,” he said.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said it was his ambition to ensure third-level education was accessible to everyone, regardless of age, race, geography or gender.“In order to achieve that aim, we must ensure that our policies strengthen the participation of students in higher education, and to do that we need accurate data and evidence,” he said.He has announced a review of the Susi grants scheme and is planning a series of new targets in a new National Access Plan, which aims to boost the number of under-represented groups at third level.The HEA’s head of access policy, Caitríona Ryan, cautioned against comparing inidual colleges against each other because each institution serves a unique region.For example, Donegal is categorised as the most disadvantaged county in the State, while parts of Dublin are among the most affluent areas nationwide.She said all colleges had access initiatives in place to boost the numbers of disadvantaged and under-represented groups, such as students from the Travelling community, students with disabilities and first-time mature students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429082.1607276373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how can the class gap in higher education be bridged","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Hernandez, president of Letterkenny Institute of Technology student union. Photograph: Joe DunneOn any given day, Mary Hernandez sees the financial struggles facing students at Letterkenny Institute of Technology (LYIT) up close.“Huge numbers here are on Susi grants, but many are just outside the limit to get them and find it very difficult,” says Hernandez, president of LYIT’s students union.“You have students who don’t have digital devices or don’t have wifi at home, or can’t afford to get to college by bus or car.”Based on the findings of a new study by the Higher Education Authority, LYIT has – by some distance – the highest proportion of disadvantaged students in the State.Some 25 per cent of the 5,000 students at LYIT are categorised as disadvantaged based on their home address just 3 per cent are categorised as affluent.This compares with a national average across the higher education sector of 10 per cent who are disadvantaged and 20 per cent who are affluent.LYIT also has the highest proportion of students reliant on grant aid, and the lowest average household income (€35,800 compared with a national average of about €50,000).About 250km away in Dublin, the picture – in many respects – is very different.The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has one of the highest concentrations of students from well-off areas.A third of its Irish students are categorised as affluent (33 per cent), while a small minority are categorised as disadvantaged (5 per cent).It has one of the lowest proportion of students in receipt of Susi grants and one of the highest average household incomes (€55,000).These figures exclude international students, who account for about 60 per cent of graduates and whose annual fees can cost up to €56,000 a year to study medicine.Struggling studentsAlthough fewer students are in receipt of grant aid, many still struggle, says Anna Whitaker, welfare officer with RCSI students union committee. High Dublin rents are a major burden, she says, while part-time jobs are few and far between this year.“Many students find themselves ineligible for the jobseeker’s allowance or the pandemic unemployment payment, while others have chronic conditions or are sharing a household with or caring for at-risk family members.”RCSI points out that it offers a number of initiatives to support school leavers from disadvantaged backgrounds.About 12 per cent of CAO places in pharmacy, physiotherapy and medicine are made available on reduced points to eligible students through special access routes.The Higher Education Authority’s head of access policy, Caitríona Ryan, cautions against comparing inidual colleges against each other on the basis that each institution serves a unique region.For example, Donegal is categorised as the most disadvantaged county in the State, while parts of Dublin are among the most affluent areas nationwide.However, the HEA’s new report points to one over-arching finding: the higher education system does not reflect wider society.Disadvantaged students are under-represented, while advantaged students over over-represented. In other words, students from well-off families are much more likely to progress to higher education than others.Overall, about 15 per cent of the population in Ireland is defined as “affluent”.Within higher education, the proportion of students from this background is 20 per cent. And within prestige courses such as medicine, finance and engineering, this rises to 35 per cent.By contrast, about 15 per cent of the population nationally is defined as “disadvantaged”. This falls to 10 per cent within the higher-education student body, and plummets to just 3.5 per cent within university courses such as medicine.Disadvantaged students are more likely to study courses in childcare, youth services and sports, which have lower points requirements.These figures show that well-off families still have a firm grip on university places, despite the rapid expansion of higher education and the introduction of “fee-free education” more than two decades ago.Bridging the gapSo, what can be done to bridge the gap? Is the cost of college a major barrier? And are access initiatives simply tinkering around the edges of a problem that has existed for decades?There are a variety of access schemes for students from disadvantaged backgrounds or with disabilities that provide lower points entry routes into college.However, most experts acknowledge that the work involved in boosting access to third level among under-represented groups needs to start as early as primary school.They say it means building stronger links between schools and colleges, along with raising expectations among pupils that third level is for them, even if no one in their family has never progressed beyond second level.Financial barriers are also daunting. While about 40 per cent of the student population receive grant aid from Susi, student leaders and access officers have repeatedly pointed out that the financial support does not come near to covering the costs of going to third level.For example, the latest research shows the cost of going to college away from home is about €12,000 a year.The Technological Higher Education Association says students from disadvantaged backgrounds require significant extra supports in order to enable them to progress through to completion of their programme.Given that institutes of technology are leaders in driving access to higher education, Dr Joseph Ryan, chief executive of the association, says it is only right that they should receive additional core funding to reflect this.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris says one of his key ambitions is to ensure third-level education is accessible to everyone, regardless of age, race, geography or gender. It is a noble sentiment but he will be judged on outcomes over the coming years."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Irish Wind Energy Association says single biggest barrier to development is Ireland\u0026rsquos electricity transmission gridPanda facility is due to be running by end of 2021 and will process up to one billion plastic bottles a yearEU\u0026rsquos largest producer agreed last year to one of world\u0026rsquos most ambitious climate targets"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429171.1607283605!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kerry employer builds homes to help and retain staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Wójs family from Castleisland outside their new house built in a not-for-profit initiative by Marcin’s  employer Walsh Colour Print. Photograph: Domnick WalshSt Nicholas’ Day, on December 6th, is when Polish children get a visit from a certain white-bearded, red-robed figure. And if they are good, the original Santa brings small gifts and treats.This Sunday, one Polish family living in Co Kerry was celebrating a somewhat larger handover – as they took ownership of their own home after a 16-year wait.A national company that includes the educational title Educate.ie, Walsh Colour Print was established in 1991 in the small Kerry town synonymous with the late Con Houlihan and a great rugby and athletics tradition.In 2017, the company embarked on the groundbreaking project to enable employees to own their own homes in an effort to provide security for its staff as well as to attract and retain workers.The houses in small blocks are A-rated, with air-to-water heating, and come in at the not-for-profit price of €150,000 – the price signalled by Tony and Patricia Walsh three years ago when they began the project.Family struggleThe first three have been finished, with another 17 under construction.Mr Wójs was the catalyst for the project, Mr Walsh explained. A fork lift driver who had been working with the company for 12 years, he told the company of the family’s struggle to find their own home and how it was getting them down.“Our worry was what was going to happen him when he’s 65 and renting all those years,” Mr Walsh said.The Wójs were “trapped “ earning too much to qualify for social housing and not able to reach the mortgage for houses in Kerry. At the same time the cost of rent is hefty and prices are continuing to rise.Anyone working for the company will now have the opportunity to own their own home and the mortgage repayments will be less than the rental, Mr Walsh said.“We hope this will give us the edge, in retaining our workforce and also in recruiting new people,” he added.Ten-year scheme“The houses are fully owned by our employees. Employees have to work with the company for 10 years and after that they are free to sell without any penalty.”Mr Wójs’s wife Anna, who is working with Educate.ie, said the couple were so frustrated at paying rents of €900-€1,000 a month they considered leaving Ireland. “Lots of friends moved back to Poland two and three years ago,” she said.Owning their own home “means a lot”, she said.

Three of the deportations were ordered before March.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee told Independent TD Catherine Connolly in a parliamentary reply two weeks ago that 469 deportation orders were issued since the outbreak of the virus in March up to the end of October.Of the total, 200 deportation orders were issued in March, but none for the following four months from April to July. They recommenced in August, when 134 orders were issued, along with 35 in September and 100 in October, the last month for which figures are available.Ms McEntee said her department and the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which has responsibility for deportations, “are taking a pragmatic approach” to enforcement during the pandemic. “This is evidenced by the low number of deportations actually carried out during this time.”But Ms Higgins said that “rather than saying ambiguous things like ‘We’re pragmatic and it probably won’t happen’, they’d be better to give assurance that it won’t happen during this period of time”.“As long as we are in a state of emergency, we shouldn’t be deporting people or issuing them with deportation notices.”Sunset clauseThe legislation has a sunset clause, with the moratorium on deportations remaining in place for as long as the Government’s Covid emergency legislation remains in operation.Ms Higgins also claimed that people had shown up for deportation and were then not removed but would receive another notice to show up three months later.The department said that “persons who leave the State voluntarily preserve the right to enter the State at a later date, with a valid basis”.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said in the Dáil last month that he would not like to see anyone deported to countries badly affected by Covid-19 after the case of two Zimbabwean healthcare workers who faced deportation was raised.But Ms Ruane said “lots of countries are struggling with Covid because of what a volatile situation it is, even in Europe, where Belgium changed within a matter of weeks” from coping well with the virus to being overwhelmed.Since the start of the pandemic, the largest number of orders was issued to iniduals from Pakistan (105), followed by Brazil (54), Albania (49) and Georgia (39).It has also emerged that the department last June requested that a “dedicated testing pathway” for Covid-19 be established for people facing deportation.The department had requested the “exceptional and temporary arrangement” via the Department of Health, which then contacted HSE chief executive Paul Reid.Barrier to entryIn a letter sent to Mr Reid, Department of Health secretary general Jim Breslin said a number of countries required people entering to show proof they had tested negative for Covid-19.“This is creating a barrier to entry for some, including voluntary deportees,” said Mr Breslin in the letter, seen by The . “It would also pose a challenge should the State need to undertake an urgent deportation.”The Department of Justice is “keen to put a facility in place both to enable those wishing to voluntarily return to their country to do so and to enable any urgent deportations which are required”, he wrote. Given the “exceptional circumstances”, a “dedicated testing pathway for use by the Department of Justice” should be put in place, he added.A justice spokesman confirmed that “the need for testing asymptomatic iniduals” facing deportation had been discussed with the HSE but, given the low number of deportations during the pandemic, “there was no need to progress discussions any further”.The Department of Foreign Affairs also requested in June that the Department of Health put in place an arrangement for dedicated testing pathways for essential travel by its diplomatic staff travelling to embassies abroad.The Department of Health requested the HSE to introduce arrangements for a test certificate to be issued to each person concerned. The HSE agreed and said this was appropriate."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429719.1607343469!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mary lou mcdonald i wouldn t think twice about knocking on a cumann member s door","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMary Lou McDonald: My understanding is that the knock to the door was to say obviously there is upset here, there is a problem here.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has played down an incident where a party member called to the door of a young activist in light of critical tweets she had sent.Christine O’Mahony, a member of UCD Ógra Sinn Féin, resigned from the party after a Sinn Féin member called to her house to demand she delete tweets that were critical of the party. Ms O’Mahony was also told not to discuss internal issues in public.Speaking on RTÉ’s Claire Byrne radio show, Ms McDonald said “anybody can criticise Sinn Féin, I am often critical of the party myself. There is nobody trying to censor anybody.”Ms McDonald said she knows who the person is who called to Ms O’Mahony. “This person is a local person who is known to all of the members and was elected to the position that they hold.”IssueWhen asked if it was the case that she had no issue with what happened, the Sinn Féin leader said: “I would have a huge issue with anybody going to anybody’s doors and instructing anybody that they can’t be critical. My understanding is that the knock to the door was to say obviously there is upset here, there is a problem here. There are internal mechanisms through which this can be addressed, that is all.”Ms O’Mahony had criticised Brian Stanley for a 2017 tweet about Leo Varadkar which appeared to refer to the Fine Gael leader’s sexuality.Mr Stanley, who initially defended the comment before deleting his social media accounts late last week, had tweeted: “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Ms McDonald said that first she “could not fathom” why he had sent it but then she said it had to be viewed in context of it being sent on the day Mr Varadkar became Fine Gael party leader.Mr Stanley is currently taking a week off before making a personal statement to the Dáil next week.Ms McDonald said she had asked Mr Stanley to take a week’s break because she “was concerned for his welfare and wanted him to have some breathing space”.No equivalenceShe said there was no equivalence between Mr Stanley’s first tweet and the controversy where Leo Varadkar leaked a document to a friend.In the first online message that caused controversy, the Laois-Offaly TD tweeted in reference to the Kilmichael Ambush in 1920 and the Narrow Water Massacre in Warrenpoint, Co Down in 1979, claiming they were “the 2 IRA operations that taught the elite of d British army and the establishment the cost of occupying Ireland. Pity for everyone they were such slow learners”.Ms McDonald said Mr Stanley had apologised for this but she said the actual problem was the “tone”.“Tone is everything. I think the reality is that recognition and recall of ambushes in the course of the war of independence and beyond, these are matters that are marked and commented on, and yes the tone was the problem.”She said there isn’t a single shared view in Ireland about the country’s history."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4412599.1605705856!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"evolved to run but not to exercise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOur hunter-gatherer and farming ancestors never ran or walked several miles a day just for health. Photograph: iStock Exercise leaves us healthier and more likely to live longer, yet many of us struggle to swallow the recommended dose of physical activity.This is because it is unnatural to exercise, says Prof Daniel Lieberman, a top evolutionary scientist at Harvard University. He has studied extinct humans and living hunter gatherers for decades, and describes exercise as a uniquely modern phenomenon.“When people don’t exercise, we label them as lazy,” laments Lieberman, “but they are actually doing what we evolved to do - which is to avoid unnecessary physical activity.” His recent book is Exercised - The Science of Physical Activity, Rest and Health. In it he busts myths and misunderstandings about exercise by looking at it from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology and anthropology.The biggest myth, he says, is that it is normal to exercise. Our hunter-gatherer and farming ancestors never ran or walked several miles a day just for health. Lieberman explains why exercising can be so difficult and suggests how to overcome our instincts to avoid it.If you ever watched the gorillas or chimps in Dublin Zoo, they spend a lot of time inactive, sitting around grooming or feeding. A 2016 study in Nature showed that apes spend hundreds of calories less energy per day than we do. A chimpanzee typically is inactive for 10.5 hours in a 12-hour day. Our ape ancestors evolved for sluggish activity levels to suit life in a rainforest.Around 7 million years ago, as the climate in Africa dried and rainforests retreated, our ancestors evolved to walk on two legs. They took on a different strategy to our ape relatives, wherein we spent more calories to earn more calories - and reproduce twice as fast. “We evolved an unusually expensive way of increasing our reproductive success, from an unusually low-energy-budget ancestor,” Lieberman writes. He argues that as result, our deeply embedded human instinct during downtime is “to be as inactive as possible.”While some describe sitting as the new smoking, he scoffs at this notion. “Hunter-gatherers sit as much as Westerners,” he says. Studies of Hazda hunter-gatherers in Africa show them typically spending nine hours sitting, two hours squatting and an hour kneeling each day.Still, average hunter-gatherer men and women walk about 9.5km (six miles a day), respectively, in order to hunt or collect food. We evolved to walk with extreme efficiency. Chimps spend about twice as many calories to walk the same distance as humans. Therefore, it is hard to expend large amounts of calories quickly by walking. Our ancestors evolved to be endurance walkers, adds Lieberman, but only when necessary. Our adaptions include a big toe that points forward, angled thighs and the forward curve in our lower spines.Born to runOne part of Lieberman’s research that attracts media attention is his focus on how we also evolved for endurance running. “We have short toes, and an arch in our foot, which is basically a spring. You don’t need an arch for walking, but you need one for running,” he says. “We have long tendons in our leg like the Achilles’.”And there’s our unusually large gluteus maximus, the largest muscle in the human body. “Which we don’t use when we are walking, but which is incredibly important for running,” says Lieberman. There is also a special “nuchal ligament,” which works like a spring and keeps our heads steady as we run.Gorillas, chimps and our early ancestors lack this ligament. It first appears about two million years ago in Homo erectus, along with other adaptations for running. Fossil evidence suggests that this is when running long distances to scavenge and hunt became important. We were never fast. Almost all four-legged creatures can outsprint Usain Bolt. Instead, we evolved to be long-distance runners.Lieberman proved this to himself when he once took part in a race in Arizona over 40km (25 miles), with 40 others on shank’s mare, competing against 53 horses and riders. After 4 hours 20 minutes, he had finished ahead of all but 13 horses.While antelopes, horses and zebras easily galloped away from human hunters, our ancestors (just like Lieberman in Arizona) did not give up. Yet for most of human history, hunting animals meant getting up close. The first stone-tipped spear dates to around 500,000 years ago, and the bow and arrow was invented just 100,000 years ago.Persistence hunting seems to have been widespread. This involves humans running and walking after prey, never letting it cool down, and tracking it until it overheats and exhausts itself. The San hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari in southern Africa have been recorded hunting in this way, with the average distance slightly longer than a half marathon.Humans are especially adapted not to overheat. In his book, Lieberman crowns humans the sweating champions of the world. We alone have five to 10 million sweat glands all over our skin, allowing us to sweat one litre every hour, which keeps us cool, something animals we pursue cannot do.“Until relatively recently, running was part of everyday life,” says Lieberman. This includes accounts from Native Americans, Australian aborigines, Africans and Siberians. It is only in the modern world that we don’t have to run anymore and with that comes problems.Run to repair Walking and running are essential to switch on repair and maintenance in our bodies. Exercise breaks down muscles and triggers inflammation, but this in turn switches on anti-inflammatory and repair mechanisms. The long-term effect is less inflammation all over the body. Exercise also keeps off belly fat, which in itself is a major cause of inflammation and other problems. “We evolved to be physically active. It is important for almost every system in the body,” he adds.But we evolved to be active when it is either necessary or fun - dancing is a fun tradition in almost all human cultures. When we exercise we produce chemicals that make us feel good and can lift our mood. But dopamine levels, for example, only go up after we exercise, so cannot get us off the couch, and (rather unfairly) overweight people have fewer dopamine receptors. We never evolved to be physically inactive and out of shape, so many of the rewards from exercise only come after several months, Lieberman explains .We all know exercise is good for us. But our natural instinct is not to exercise. “Two-thirds of Americans don’t exercise, and I dare say that the data are not that different in countries like Ireland and elsewhere,” Lieberman says. He argues that we need to accept how natural it is not to exercise and come up with ways to get around this - similar to how we approach education.The key to getting started is to try make it social and fun and also to enter into a commitment contract, like we do during university studies. “I am a professor at a university where students pay for me to essentially torture them, making them do all kinds of work,” Lieberman says. He supports compulsory physical activity in schools and universities.For adults, we might schedule exercises with a friend, and be socially obligated to show up. One can pay to enter a race or event that requires training, or post exercises online so others can see what you are doing, and not doing. Or one could designate someone you admire or fear as a referee to check up on your progress. Or commit to teams or sports clubs. “One thing we do with education is make it social and we make it fun,” he points out – and we should do the same with exercise.We also need to accept that exercise is not natural and is challenging for most people. “Let’s stop pretending that exercise is necessarily fun, especially for habitual non-exercisers,” Lieberman advises.The book Exercised can easily be enjoyed over the upcoming festive season, when we all begin to consider changes for 2021 and most of us reflect on how we might fit in – against our instincts – more exercise."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4429240.1607292118!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit last push for trade deal as talks remain very difficult","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU chief negotiator Michel Barnier arrives at Brussels Midi station after Brexit talks in London. Photograph: Kenzo TribouillardAFP via GettyNegotiators are locked in a final heave to find an agreement in Brussels on trade relations between the European Union and UK that will determine the fate of the Irish economy, with just a few weeks left to go.Talks were described as “very difficult” by those close to the negotiations, as the two teams, led by the EU’s Michel Barnier and the UK’s David Frost, made a last effort to bridge Britain’s desire to erge from EU standards and the bloc’s determination to protect its market.Member states have summoned Barnier to update them on the progress of the negotiations first thing on Monday morning, in the wake of warnings from some capitals that they could veto a compromise if it were to give Britain a permanent edge over their own domestic economies.In a move viewed as unhelpful by Brussels and Dublin, Boris Johnson will on Monday ask members of parliament to vote for controversial legislative clauses that would allow ministers to renege on the Brexit withdrawal agreement signed with the EU last year.The House of Lords removed the clauses from the Internal Market Bill but environment secretary George Eustice said MPs should restore them.He told Sky News that the clauses were important as an insurance policy for Britain, particularly if the current negotiations were to end without a deal.“Where the joint committee process between the UK and the EU fails to come up with clarity about how the Northern Ireland protocol should be interpreted, it’s absolutely crucial that the UK government has the powers to provide legal clarity,” he said.Trust ‘undermined’Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said it would be “crazy” if the UK concluded a trade deal with the EU this week and then passed legislation that prevented it being ratified.“Flexing muscles in Westminster may play well in terms of domestic politics in the UK but I think it has undermined trust with the EU,” said the Minister.“I still think it is more likely than not that we will find a way to getting a deal done but I won’t be shocked if it falls apart,” Mr Coveney said en route to Brussels on Sunday night.Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Sunday put the chances of a deal at “50-50” but stressed “an agreement is in everyone’s best interests”.Asked about contingency planning around a no-deal, Mr Coveney said: “If we don’t get a deal in the next few days, then obviously there are very serious problems around ratification and timelines.”A fishing industry source said that a three-year deal on EU fishing in UK waters – as suggested by Mr Eustice – and the loss of further access would “spell the death knell of the Irish seafood sector”.Mr Coveney said he would not speculate on what was being offered on fishing.Britain’s introduction of the legislation has hardened demands from the EU side for guarantees that would prevent Britain from breaking fair competition agreements after any deal was signed, leading to stand-offs over what authority could arbitrate any future disputes.Any deal reached by negotiators must win the approval of member states and be ratified by both the British parliament and the European Parliament, a process that MEPs have warned there may not now be sufficient time left to do.Both sides see the talks as nearing an imminent end point, with the next days to decide conclusively whether Britain will end its transition period on December 31st with a deal with its largest trading partner, or an abrupt dissolution of terms expected to cause widespread disruption.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

The legislature frequently updates Acts and now is the right time to take a fresh look at the Human Rights Act, see how its provisions are operating and consider whether the framework could be improved.Ministers say the review is not in response to specific cases such as last week\u0027s deportation but aims to be an independent investigation into the wider workings of the Act.The review, which will report next summer, will focus on three key areas including the duty in the Act for judges to take into account European case law, which critics claim has led to them gold-plating Britain\u0027s human rights duties.As part of a separate review of asylum, the Home Office wants to narrow the types of cases which can use Article 3 of the Human Rights Act in a bid to stop judges gold-plating the UK\u0027s duties under international law. It could mean the Government would be able to deport hundreds more foreign criminals a year as they would be blocked from bringing spurious human rights claims.The Ministry of Justice review will also investigate whether judges have been unduly drawn into Government policy over human rights and whether they should still have the power to rewrite laws if they are determined to be in conflict with the Human Rights Act.In his article, Mr Buckland said this had not always been limited to minor, uncontroversial technical changes but had, for example, been used to strike down the rape shield which had banned the cross-examination of rape complainants on their past sexual behaviour. The court held that this law was not compliant with the Human Rights Act as it infringed on the right to a fair trial, and used its power to re-write this legislation, adding exceptions to the rape shield law, he said. It is surely worth asking whether, and if so how, such important and controversial decisions over how to change the law should be returned to Parliament.The third area centres on whether there should be changes to the way the Human Rights Act applies outside the UK, such as the contentious issue of whether soldiers should be covered on active duties overseas.A Bill currently before Parliament giving British troops and veterans greater protection against prosecution has been criticised by human rights groups.Mr Buckland said: Let there be no doubt that this Government remains committed to human rights and that our Parliamentary democracy must continue leading the world in this area of the law. We believe that an independent review is best placed to determine whether there are ways in which the Human Rights Act can and should change for the future. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rudy giuliani tests positive covid 19","story":"Rudy Giuliani said he was feeling good and recovering quickly after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus.The 76-year old former New York City mayor is being treated at Georgetown University Medical Centre and because of his age is likely to be considered as being in a high risk category.Mr Giuliani thanked all his supporters on Twitter for their kind thoughts and said he was feeling good.Thank you to all my friends and followers for all the prayers and kind wishes, he wrote.I’m getting great care and feeling good.Recovering quickly and keeping up with everything.As the president\u0027s attorney, Mr Giuliani has spearheaded Donald Trump\u0027s legal battle to overturn the result of the presidential election, appearing in federal court for the first time in 28 years last month to advance his case.And it was Mr Trump who first announced Mr Giuliani\u0027s  illness on Twitter and the US president paid tribute to his lawyer who has hurtled around the country advancing the president\u0027s allegation that the election was rigged.By far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, and who has been working tirelessly exposing the most corrupt election (by far!) in the history of the USA, has tested positive for the China Virus. Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!! Mr Trump tweeted.Mr Giuliani attended a hearing at the Georgia Capitol on Thursday where he went without a mask for several hours. Several state senators, all Republicans, also did not wear masks at the hearing.On Wednesday night, Mr Giuliani was in Lansing, Michigan, to testify in a highly unusual 4 12-hour legislative hearing in which he pushed Republican lawmakers to ignore the certification of Joe Biden\u0027s Michigan victory and appoint electors for Mr Trump. He did not wear a mask, nor did lawyer Jenna Ellis, who was sitting next to him. During the hearing, Mr Giuliani asked one of his witnesses, a Detroit election worker, if she would feel comfortable removing her face mask as she sat next to him giving evidence. She declined when lawmakers in the room confirmed that they could hear her.Mr Giuliani travelled on Monday to Phoenix where he met with Republican legislators for an hour long hearing in which he was maskless. The Arizona Republican Party tweeted a photo of Mr Giuliani and several state GOP lawmakers standing shoulder-to-shoulder and maskless.The Arizona legislature announced on Sunday, after Mr Giuliani\u0027s diagnosis became public, that it would close for a week out of an abundance of caution for recent cases and concerns relating to Covid-19.On Sunday night, the Trump campaign released a statement from the president\u0027s legal team which said Mr Giuliani had tested negative just before his trip to the three states.Mayor Giuliani tested negative twice immediately preceding his trip to Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia. The Mayor did not experience any symptoms or test positive for Covid-19 until more than 48 hours after his return, the statement said. No legislators in any state or members of the press are on the contact tracing list, under current CDC (Centers for Disease Control) Guidelines.It said other members of the president\u0027s legal team who are defined as having had close contact will follow their doctors\u0027 orders and CDC guidelines about self-isolation and testing.Unidentified Trump team members who had close contact with Mr Giuliani are reportedly in self-isolation.Mr Giuliani is the latest member of the Trump inner circle to be diagnosed with Covid. The president himself spent several days in the Walter Reed Medical Centre in Maryland after being tested positive for coronavirus in early October.The diagnosis emerged  a few days after Mr Giuliani claimed a rare victory in the legal onslaught against the election after a judge in Michigan ordered a forensic examination of 22 Dominion voting machines in the rural county of Antrim.However, the ruling was not related to the presidential election.Nevertheless, Mr Giuliani sought to stress the significance of the ruling: This is where the untrustworthy Dominion machine flipped 6,000 votes from Trump to Biden.

But I honestly don\u0027t know.At the time the books were written the Labour leader was making a name for himself as a leading barrister, just like Mr Darcy.Sir Keir had assisted Helen Steel and David Morris in the famous McLibel case, as well as representing the National Union of Miners and acting a legal observer at the Wapping strikes in the \u002780s.It was also suspected the pair may have crossed paths early in life.They both attended Oxford University (though in different years) and had been living in Leeds around the same time.Ms Fielding is understood to have been living in Morely, West Yorkshire, while Sir Keir studied for his undergraduate degree at the University of Leeds in 1985.In July Ms Fielding said a “number of people” lay claim to be the inspiration behind Mr Darcy’s character.It’s amazing the number of people that lay claim to be Daniel or Mark, including Keir Starmer, she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Desert Island Discs. Though did not concretely discredit the suspected link.And, despite “always denying” Bridget was based on her own life, she added, “of course she was very close to me in some ways but not in others.I was a single girl in London and having lots of fun.But she has now finally put the rumour mill to bed, telling Radio Times Christmas Issue that although she thinks he’s “fantastic”, Sir Keir is not the basis of the character and the pair have never met.“They are very similar, though,” she told Radio Times.“He’s so good and decent and intelligent, but so buttoned up. I always want to say, ‘Come on, Keir, loosen your tie, ruffle up your hair.’ “He doesn’t think of himself as sexy, but he’s really sexy.”Ms Fielding went on to add: “And when he and Boris spar, it does remind me of Mark and Daniel.”Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth in the film adaptations, and Daniel Cleaver, played by Hugh Grant, frequently clashed over their respective love for Bridget, played by Renee Zellwegger. Though Mr Johnson and Sir Keir may have come to blows verbally in the Commons frequently, they are yet to be pictured scrapping in any water fountains.It’s now 25 years since Ms Fielding first published her newspaper column as Bridget Jones, which went on to be novelised in 1996 and a sequel published in 1999. The books were adapted for film in 2001 and 2004, with a third novel released in 2013 and a fourth in 2016. The 2016 film Bridget Jones’s Baby became the UK’s highest-grossing romantic comedy of the year.To mark the 25th anniversary a BBC Two documentary, Being Bridget, will be aired on December 22. “If somebody had told me at the time that people would still be talking about it in 25 years, I would never have believed them,” she told Radio Times.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news corridors covid test vaccine restrictions","story":"The Brexit transition period will end on December 31 2020How to get a Covid test for your holidayThe 23 countries you can (feasibly) visit Can you travel between tiers at Christmas? Sign up to the  Travel newsletter Millions of British holidaymakers could be denied entry into European countries in the new year, if their passports are set to expire within six months.This means any British person entering the Continent on January 1 with an expiry date sooner than July 2021 could be turned away, under new rules coming into force when the Brexit transition period is over.Until now British holidaymakers have been able to enter EU countries so long as they had a valid passport. The new rule change is expected to catch many people out, and could affect as many as 2.5 million people.The Passport Office turnaround time is approximately three weeks for online applications, according to the Home Office. This means that those hoping to travel in early 2021 with an expiring passport will need to renew it now.To complicate matters further, some people whose passports do not expire until the end of 2021 or even the beginning of 2022 may also be turned away when entering the EU. Some UK passports have up to ten years and nine months of validity, but the EU will now ignore the additional nine months. This means some people will be refused entry to the EU, even if they have fifteen months left on their passports.After the end of the Brexit transition process, European Health Insurance (EHIC) cards will no longer be valid and driving rules will likely change for British holidaymakers.Follow all the latest updates below.News of an imminent vaccination programme for Covid-19 has given consumers the confidence to book cruises again, according to research conducted by a cruise travel agency.Britain\u0027s medicines regulator, the MHRA, said that the PfizerBioNTech Covid vaccine – which offers up to 95 per cent protection against the coronavirus – is ready to be rolled out from this week, although the bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year.The entire cruise industry paused operations in March 2020 as coronavirus spread around the globe Approval of the vaccine appears to have acted as a shot in the arm for the cruise industry, which has largely been at a standstill since the pandemic began.A survey carried out by travel agency Mundy Cruising showed that 81 per cent of its customers were planning to return to the high seas in 2021 – but the majority said their plans would be dependent on being vaccinated before boarding.Almost half – 47 per cent – of respondents said that they would only cruise once both they and the majority of the population had been vaccinated, while a further 39 per cent said that their vaccination would suffice.Read the full report here.From 1 January 2021 you will not be able to use the existing pet passport scheme. Instead you’ll need to follow a different process, which takes four months. Act now if you are hoping to take your pet on holiday at some point in 2021.The complex rules prompted the BBC’s assistant political editor, Norman Smith, to say: “Speaking as a dog owner it looks to me frankly such a faff, you are just not going to bother.”Speaking on the Today programme, he explained: “You are going to have to take your pet to the vet to get a rabies vaccination. You’ll then have to return a month later to get a blood test, send that blood test to an EU laboratory. Their vet will then send back the ‘OK’. You’ll then have to wait another three months before you can go.“I’m just thinking: pets of Great Britain, you can say farewell to the Dordogne.”The number of new Covid-19 infections per day in France is unlikely to fall to a 5,000 target by December 15 as the population is not sufficiently respecting social distancing measures, one of France\u0027s top coronavirus experts said today.Eric Caumes, head of infectious diseases at Paris hospital La Pitié-Salpêtrière, told LCI television that if the French are not cautious enough over Christmas and year-end holidays, it will lead to a third wave of the virus in mid-January.President Emmanuel Macron has said the French lockdown that started on October 30 could be lifted on  December 15, if by then the number of new infections per day has fallen to 5,000.“No, I do not think this target can be reached as the trend downward stopped, it is stabilising. So it will be difficult to reach that target,” Caumes said.French health authorities reported 11,022 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on Sunday, down from the 12,923 new infections detected the previous day.Dining upon gold-leaf sushi at one of Monaco’s Michelin-starred restaurants feels like a guilty pleasure during the pandemic, writes Louise Simpson.The low hum of business-as-usual is amplified by the lack of accustomed melodies – music is banned in restaurants around the principality to discourage the party crowd.

And while recent heavy snowfall meant that visitors were welcomed by enviable powder conditions the resort made waves on social media for a different reason.Pictures of crowds of skiers and snowboarders queuing, both inside and outside, to access the resort’s main lift in La Chable went viral.

These include testing negative for Covid and submitting a detailed travel itinerary before entering the country.Tourists will also reportedly have to avoid public transport and travel only by hired coaches, plus they will be separated from domestic tourists at hotels and sightseeing destinations.Furthermore, tourists will be required to use a tracing app at all times and provide daily updates on their health. Japan may reopen to international tourists from next spring, ahead of the delayed Tokyo Olympics scheduled to take place in the summer. Read the full report here.Russia confirmed 28,142 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours on Monday, including 7,279 in Moscow, pushing the national tally to 2,488,912 since the pandemic began.Authorities said 456 people had died overnight, taking the official death toll to 43,597. Our Deputy Head of Travel, Ben Ross, explains it all.Police forces patrolled the perimeters of some tier two and three areas over the weekend in a bid to curb breaches of rules on non-essential travel. “It is our responsibility to keep the public of North Yorkshire safe,” said Superintendent Mike Walker of North Yorkshire PoliceNorth Yorkshire Police confirmed last week that it would be increasing its presence on border areas to discourage people from travelling to the county from surrounding Tier 3 locations.Automatic Number Plate Recognition technology (ANPR) is also being used to monitor cross-border traffic. North Yorkshire is currently under Tier 2 regulations, with all surrounding counties – except Cumbria – in Tier 3.

Askedthe Armed Forces would be involved, he told BBC Breakfast: “If we need to.”It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to speak tonight to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after  hours of “last roll of the dice” talks.A trade deal from January  is still held up by clashes on fishing, the ‘level playing field’ of EU rules and how any deal is policed in future. The UK government has planned  lorry parks for use next year as it fears the extra bureaucracy after Brexit will cause delays at Britain’s ports. While some of this will happen anyway because the UK is leaving the EU single market and customs union, it is likely to be worse in a no-deal Brexit. A ‘worst-case scenario’ document obtained by ITV’s Robert Peston last night claimed the flow of medicines could initially reduce to -% over three months”. Askedthere could be signicant delays getting the vaccine into the UK due to Brexit, Foreign Office minister Mr Cleverly told the BBC: “The vaccine is the top priority product in terms of bringing anything into the UK.”  Askedthe Armed Forces could be used he replied: “Potentially. We are looking at non commercial flight options. “This is such an important product, perhaps the most important product, so we will look to ensure that those supplies are available in the UK in whatever circumstance.” Asked to confirm that meant the Armed Forces could be used, he replied: “If we need to.” The UK has ordered  million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech jab, enough to vaccinate  million people as two doses are needed.

Hundreds of thousands of doses arrived in the UK on Friday on refrigerated trucks from Belgium. From there they were taken to specialist refrigerated storage facilities, at undisclosed locations, before finally being shipped to the  hospitals taking part in stage one of the rollout. And the first pictures of vaccine arriving in an NHS hospital, released today, show a pharmacy technician from Croydon Health Services taking delivery at Croydon University Hospital of the first batch to be delivered to the area. The UK has secured  million doses of the vaccine, enough to treat  million people in the coming months. The doses will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday – with people aged  and over, care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk the first to receive the jab. There are  hubs in the first wave of the vaccination programme in England, with more hospitals starting to vaccinate over the coming weeks and months as the programme ramps up. The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used for the national immunisation programmes.  It comes as Matt Hancock claimed that a second vaccine, made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca may be approved for use in the UK as soon as Christmas. The Health Secretary suggested that the UK made jab could quickly follow the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, and become the second to get the green light from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency . He said “It may come before Christmas, it may come early in the new year. On Sunday the UKaposs chief medicine regulator said there was no doubt that the Covid vaccine approved in the UK is safe.  Mr Hancock also claimed a successful rollout would mean lockdown restrictions could end before March. The Health Secretaryaposs optimistic prediction comes as hospitals are preparing to begin the first phase of the largest-scale vaccination campaign in the UKaposs history. GP surgeries in England have been told to start staffing COVID- vaccination centres by  December. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , which approved the Pfizer BioNTech jab, said there “should be no doubt whatever that this is a very safe and highly effective vaccine”.  Asked on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show about how important the public health message is to make sure that people actually take the vaccine, she said: “It’s vitally important. And I would really like to emphasise that the highest standards of scrutiny, of safety and of effectiveness and quality have been met, international standards. And so there should be real confidence in the rigour of our approval. The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers said the UK is expecting to receive up to four million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine by the end of December. But Saffron Cordery explained the dficulty of getting the virus into care homes and smaller community-based vaccination centres. She told Sky Newsaposs Sophy Ridge On Sunday that only hospitals had the infrastructure to store the vaccines because of the incredibly low temperature it is required to be stored at.  She said hospitals receiving the first batch of vaccines were calling people aged  and over in their areas to come into hospitals and setting up separate clinics on-site. Right now they can only be administered in hospitals but trusts up and down the country are working with the MHRA , who is overseeing this process, to seethey can get them distributed more closely to care homes so that they can go into care homes and sort the vaccines for those residents, she said. Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: Despite the huge complexities, hospitals will kickstart the first phase of the largest scale vaccination campaign in our countryaposs history from Tuesday.  Ben Osborn, the UK chief executive of Pfizer, told The Mail on Sunday that he is so confident about the safety of the jab that he is willing to take it today and wants his mother to have it as soon as possible.Mr Hancock has reportedly been referring to Tuesday as V-Day and told The Sundaythat he canapost wait to scrap the three-tier system of coronavirus restrictions before March and get back to living by mutual respect and personal responsibility, not laws set in parliament.When askedthe distribution of the vaccine beginning this week could mean restrictions end sooner, he said: Yes, it will. He added: Thereaposs no doubt that having the vaccine early... will bring forward the moment when we can get rid of these blasted restrictions but until then we have got to follow them. It came as plans emerged to see millions of doses of the Covid- vaccine manufactured in Belgium flown into this country by military aircraft to avoid delays at ports caused by Brexit, under contingency plans being developed by the government.Both the Department of Health and Social Care, and senior sources at the Ministry of Defence , confirmed that large consignments would be brought to the UK from  January by airroad, rail and sea routes were subject to widely expected delays after that date. On the threat of no-deal Brexit Dr Raine said we are ready”. “We’ve practised, we are ready, we are fully prepared for any possible outcome,” she told Andrew Marr. Elsewhere, the Queen and Prince Philip are both expected to have the coronavirus vaccine within weeks but palace sources insisted they “will not jump the queue” and instead have it at the appropriate time. The monarch,  and Duke of Edinburgh, , will both be eligible in the second round of vaccinations aftercare home residents.  Palace sources suggested the royal would be reluctant to go public with their decision to be vaccinated, despite figures in government feeling it would send a strong message to the public. Meanwhile, there is still no guaranteed date for when care home residents will be vaccinated despite them being at the top of the priority list, with Health Secretary Matt Hancock saying there are “signicant challenges” to overcome.  Logistical issues mean there are dficulties in getting the jab to residents, as the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus C before being thawed out and can only be moved four times within that cold chain before being used. The vaccine boxes containing  doses will need to be split so that they can be brought to care homes. Dr Raine told Marr: “We have approved how the vaccine can be put into the small packs, but obviously what we’re doing is giving advice and guidance on how well that, carefully, that is done.

But fishing, while itaposs worth comparatively little to the UK, is politically impossible to ignore. Itaposs emblematic of the entire Brexit argument - Britannia ruling the waves as a sovereign nation, evil Johnny Foreigner nicking our fish and chips, and a load of old pollocks pretending to be something theyaposre not.Because while Johnson and his Hard Brexit weirdos bang on about piracy on the high seas, theyaposre forgetting the uncomfortable fact that the British fishing industry is not particularly British. Most of the British fishing fleet is controlled by just five firms - pescatarian barons who send supertrawlers out to scrape the seas of all that might be edible. The fuel their ships use is heavily subsidised by the EU.Government statistics show % of the deckhands are foreign nationals, who are cheaper and, as of January , will need to apply for visas to do the work theyaposre underpaid for, or  do it in France.They mostly fish for mackerel, which has the most profits, and itaposs mostly all sold to Europe. And less than three-quarters of it is from UK waters. The rest comes from - gasp - foreign seas.But % less mackerel is landed than in , even though the quotas have been set higher than science advises, because the drive for cash means fish stocks are disappearing.Oh, and at least one of these barons donated to the Vote Leave campaign. He must be VERY clever.Johnson is tying himself in knots over an industry with , fishermen, not all of whom are British. By comparison, the collapse of Arcadia about which the government is doing nothing involves , jobs, the failure of Debenhams risks , jobs, and the UK car industry which will collapse in a No Deal Brexit involves , workers, directly and indirectly. And , as threatened, Britain turns down an EU agreement for the sake of those fishermenaposs right to not bump into les Francaises dans le mer, those same fishermen will be facing big EU tarfs on the mackerel which they will be less able to sell abroad, but which will suddenly turn up, nice and cheap, on our supermarket shelves next to the chorinated chicken. And donapost assume, for a moment, that they can merelyto fishing for cod, and weaposll all get cheaper fish and chips. About % of the cod we consume comes from the waters around Norway and Iceland. Neither are EU members, but both are in the European Economic Area, and allow our fleet into their waters under its rules. After Brexit, they both want to fish in our waters too. So no sharing our waters, no chip supper.  To sum up - we fish in other waters, rely on foreigners to fish in our own waters, sell and buy fish with European nations, and in protecting fishing rights, are only protecting the rights of about five major corporations, some of which are foreign-owned.Itaposs the perfect emblem of Brexit, in that youaposre being lied to in order to convince you to support a thing which is ultimately more damaging than the thing youaposve already got.And thereaposs no need for the lies, because thereaposs a good pro-Brexit argument for fishing. These fleets burn huge amounts of oil that, after Brexit, will need to be subsidised in a world that wants to be greener. Post-Brexit, the government could tie fuel subsidies to cleaner vessels, better wages, higher safety standards.Quotas set by the EU have, according to campaigners, been far too high compared to the scientic advice on keeping the seas well-stocked. After we leave, we could set better quotas in our own waters, trading access to them with other nations infor healthier numbers of fish.And we could also use the laws of the sea as a blueprint for how we should deal with Europe after Brexit - co-operation, mutual interest, a better environment, and an understanding that,the fish get to keep their freedom of movement, perhaps humans could remember that borders are optional, too."},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror coronavirus vaccine brings","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Coronavirus vaccine brings hope but Tories may still ruin itWe cannot overlook the ability of this Conservative Government to throw away an opportunitymirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  DEC NewsopinionThe vaccine is a reason to be cheerful but the Tories could still mess it up, says The Voice of the Mirror \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The -year-old rang the Sainsburyaposs head office and said he was told the same thing. However, he claims the Japanese game developer told him the issue was between Sainsburyaposs and its supplier. Mr Gibbs went back to the store with a letter from the Citizensapos Advice Bureau, which said the supermarket was liable to recty the issue as it had sold him the product. Two days later, he says, the store apologised, agreed to replace the game, and added a Lego set as an additional birthday gt.

Other favourites include Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Trevor McDonald, and Dame Judi Dench. A plummy tone was named as the accent people could listen to for the longest, with the Queen’s English also the preferred voice to hear on the radio or TV. But the Irish accent was named the most attractive, while the Birmingham twang won the title for aposmost boringapos. The research was commissioned to launch Virgin Media’s new Virgin TV  , which is fully voice-activated. It also found that more than a third admitted to speaking in ‘tech tongue’ - putting on a more ‘well-spoken’ accent when speaking to smart devices.  Almost one in five also said they would change their accent to impress a love interest, and one in  do this when speaking to work colleagues or their bosses. And  per cent of Brits even change their normal voice tone when chatting to their pets. Jenner Smith, professor of sociolinguistics at the University of Glasgow, said: “We all have dferent ‘voices’ depending on who we’re talking to and in what situation. We’re quite good at switching up the way we talk. For some of us, this involves putting on a posher-sounding accent when speaking to someone not from our immediate network. For example a student changing how they speak when talking to a teacher. The newly coined term, ‘tech tongue’, describes the voice we use when speaking to your devices, such as your Virgin TV remote. Whether we’re aware we’re doing it or not, tech tongue tends to make us talk slower, or more clearly, and even quite posh. The study also found Brits make judgements based on each other’s voices too, forming an impression of a person’s character, how knowledgeable and how trustworthy they are - just from their voice.

Professor Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said the distribution of the vaccine would be a marathon not a sprint. Vaccinations will be administered at dozens of hospital hubs from Tuesday - dubbed V-Day by Health Secretary Matt Hancock - with people aged  and older, care home workers and NHS workers who are at higher risk at the front of the queue. Are you or a loved one getting the coronavirus vaccine this week  Email webnews@mirror. Croydon University Hospital in south London was one of the first hospitals to take delivery of the vaccine over the weekend, with similar scenes unfolding around the country ahead of the rollout. Mr Hopson said people need to hang fire and be assured they have not been forgottenthey have not received a letter or a phone call about the jab. He said: I donapost think people should expect anything over the next few days because the reality is, as I said, that for the vast, vast, vast majority of people this will be done in January, February, March. And the one thing that we donapost want people to get anxious about or concerned about is aposWhereaposs my letter apos in December.  He added: People really shouldnapost worrytheyaposre over  and they havenapost had a letter. Iaposm sure there will be communications over the next few weeks that will tell people how quickly we are getting through the over-s, and there will be plenty of communications to say, at the right point,you havenapost had a letter then you should talk to your GP, but we are many weeks away from that. So as I said people just need to hang fire and wait for a proactive communication. If that hasnapost happened, donapost worry, we havenapost forgotten you, and weaposll certainly tell you at the point at which you need to start worryingyou havenapost been contacted, but that will be many, many weeks away.  The UK has ordered  million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech jab, enough to vaccinate  million people, as people need to receive two doses. There are , doses in the first tranche, meaning , people will be vaccinated initially. There are challenges to overcome with vaccinating care home residents despite them being at the top of the priority list, but Mr Hopson said this would begin in around a weekaposs time and would be led by primary care networks. Logistical issues mean there are dficulties in delivering the Pfizer jab to residents, as it needs to be stored at minus C before being thawed out and can only be moved up to four times within that cold chain before being used. The vaccine boxes containing  doses will need to be split so they can be taken to care homes. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency , was asked when the MHRA would approve the breaking up of the vaccine packs into smaller batches for care homes. She told BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: We have approved how the vaccine can be put into the smaller packs, but obviously what weaposre doing is giving advice and guidance on how well and carefully that is done. It has been confirmed care home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the vaccine from December . The distribution of the vaccine across the UK is being undertaken by Public Health England and the NHS in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through systems specially adapted from those used for the national immunisation programmes. On arrival in Croydon, the batch of vaccines was unboxed by a pharmacy technician wearing specic protective equipment to ensure safe handling at such cold temperatures.

Recalling the day Gill, who had lung cancer, died in hospital, John, , says: “I made a pledge not to close our doors to animals that needed us. “Gill was pumped with morphine but suddenly sat upright... and then she just died in my arms.” The couple had helped ban the eating of dog and cat meat in Thailand and were a driving force behind the Soi Dog Foundation, tackling the problem of stray dogs and cats. After Gill, , died in , John and his team carried on their mission to neuter and care for stray animals. Now the couple have been awarded a Daily Mirror Animal Hero Award for their Outstanding Contribution to caring for man’s best friends.John says: “This award should not be for me, it’s for Gill and Soi Dog and our supporters. Gill’s the bravest person I’ve ever met. If anybody deserves this award she does.” John and Gill, both from Leeds, got married in Phuket in Thailand in  and fell in love with the island. John says: “I had a dog, Gill had three cats. We got another dog after we got together. We did a bit of voluntary work at the local Dogs Trust kennel. Gill was the love of my le. “We were opposites in a way, she was very outgoing, I’m not particularly. We complimented each other.” They went to Phuket regularly on holiday and eventually planned to retire there, but one thing always disturbed them when they visited. John says: “When we came here on holidays we talked about trying to do something about the horrendous problem that existed with stray dogs. “In those days there were an estimated , stray dogs, the conditions of them appalling. Most of them were skeletal and covered in mange, on every street corner you’d see stray dogs.” So when they moved to the Phuket they devoted themselves to helping thousands of street dogs and cats. John says: “We decided the only humane way we could do something about this was through large-scale sterilisation.”  They met a Dutch woman who had set up a charity called the Soi Dog Foundation and in  joined forces, deciding the best long-term solution to the dog and cat problem was a mass spay and neutering programme. Every day and night they would go out tranquillising stray dogs so they could be neutered and then recover at the shelter, now named after Gill. Hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats have been neutered since, including more than % of the stray dog population in Phuket. Crucially, Gill and John were involved in drafting legislation to make it illegal to eat dog and cat meat in Thailand. John says: “We have grown a lot. Thailand now has an animal welfare bill and the consumption of dogs and cats is now illegal. “We helped put an end to the dog meat business and the trade of dogs from Thailand to Vietnam, as well as the local consumption and skinning of dogs for fur.” In , while rescuing a dog from a flooded field, Gill contracted a rare form of septicaemia and lost both her legs.  John says: “She darted this dog and had to go into a flooded field to get it because it ran off. She dragged this dog out of the field so it wouldn’t drown. “The next day she did this big party in our house, she loved to cater for our friends, but that day she said she didn’t feel well and went to bed. “By the next morning she was in agony, I took her to hospital and her legs turned blue. I was told it was unlikely she would survive andshe did she’d lose her legs and arms.” Gill survived and did not lose her arms, and soon all she wanted to do was get home to John and her animals. John says: “Three days before Christmas she told the doctors she was determined to be home with the dogs and cats.She wanted to be with friends at Christmas, she’d always do a big Christmas dinner and cooked dinner for  people from a wheelchair. She wouldn’t have any help.”Gill battled back to health, continuing to work alongside John, and together they built a huge complex of shelters to help rescued dogs. They also established an overseas adoption programme for pets.

They were also previously the subject of a investigation by the consumer magazine into hotel hygiene during the first wave of the pandemic. When investigators visited the Grand Burstin in the summer they found stray hairs and stained towels in the room they had booked. Further tests indicated that surfaces had not been thoroughly cleaned between stays despite the fact the hotel had advertised a system of enhanced cleaning. At the time, the chain apologised for the lapse in protocol and said in a statement it was totally committed to providing a safe environment for visitors but accept there is more to do. However the companyaposs apology could not satisfy consumer choice website Which . Rory Boland, editor of magazine Which  Travel, said: “It appears that not even a global pandemic could force Britannia to clean up its act. “At best, it’s drab and dated, and at worst it’s downright filthy – and after eight years at the bottom of our survey, our message is loud and clear: avoid these hotels. “While Premier Inn remains a firm favourite, it’s clear that this year, UK hotels have become more than just a place to lay your head, but a destination in themselves.  “With fewer of us travelling abroad this year, our survey shows that when it comes to holidaying at home, we’re quite happy to pay more for a little luxury.”Reporter John James checked into a room at the Grand Burstin to see whether the hotelaposs reputation was deserved.The hotel has struggled with poor reviews for years and holds only two and a half stars on TripAdvisor. It has more than , Terrible reviews, many of them alarmingly recent. One woman wrote of her stay: What a terrible shame such a hotel still exists.  Would never stay here again and it isn’t that it’s a bargain price, it’s that price because it’s so bad. Do yourself a favour and stay where. Another wrote: The building is run down, stinks of cigarettes and booze. The interior is disgusting and our bed had pubic hair all over quite visibly.And one man swore to go to great s to never visit again.He said: Personally, couldnapost wait to leave this place and wonapost ever be back there again as I would rather sleep on the street.  Kent Live reporter John James on his stay at the Grand Burstin With such a glittering reputation, I was beginning to wonder what Iaposd let myself in for. I arrived into the Grand Burstin at around pm as the day was winding down. My first impression of the great white building that loomed above me was one of resignation. It was filthy on the outside, covered in green and brown dirt from who knows what decade. Things werenapost to improve when I ventured inside. Naively, I had assumed the hotel would be relatively quiet, considering it was a weekday. No such luck, it was packed to the rafters and the check in queue stretched around the dated foyer. As I sweated at the back of the interminable line, I did a quick headcount to see who was wearing masks.  Not only were barely any customers wearing them, many staff also had gone without. Itaposs not a requirement by law to wear them in hotels but I was still surprised. Things got worse when I reached the till and was informed Iaposd have to pay £ for the luxury of leaving my car in their car park. The sheer front of it would make a bargain flight provider blush. It was a scrum for the lts and I saw multiple family units cramming themselves into them. Disheartened, I trudged up the stairs to the fth floor to see what a double room at the Grand Burstin looks like. The TV was on when I entered the room and the view out of the window wasnapost exactly inspiring. The bedroom suffered from the worn out aesthetic of the rest of the hotel but I suppose it would look a little oddit didnapost.  Of far greater concern was the meal that came with my £ room, a sloppy plate of steak pie that managed to be greasy and dry at the same time. I stirred the tepid dish for a few seconds and trudged into the bar for a socially distanced drink. Once the bingo came on, I knew it was time for bed. I awoke with the sun light streaming in through the curtains. Iaposd deliberately left them open so as to beat the breakfast buffet rush - not that I was particularly excited for the food on show. True to Grand Burstin form, the breakfast was disappointing and actually quite meagre.

The Santa’s Magical Drive Thru Adventure in Hull has been set up to transform East Park into a winter wonderland until Christmas Eve. But a string of what organisers called teething problems on the opening day resulted in negative feedback from parents Parent complained the experience was nothing like the description. One Hull mum, who paid £ to take her three children, referred to it as “one of those horror show walk-throughs” after being greeted by a terrying Grinch in a trip “faster than a McDonald’s drive-thru,” reports Hull Live. Have you suffered from a similar experience  We want to tell your story. Email webnews@mirror Mrs Claus missed her bus while Elsa got her timing wrong, organiser Martin Holland admitted. But he said lessons were learnt and the problems have now been sorted out. “We paid £ and the experience lasted no longer than a minute,” said the -year-old mum-of-three. “I wasn’t expecting Disney Land magic but after the year we have had it was disappointing. “It was nothing like the description. Half the characters were missing.  “We drove in and was greeted by The Grinch who to be honest was like the stuff of nightmares and at that point it felt like we were in one of those horror walk through things.” Mr Holland admitted that there were a number of problems on the opening day: We organised this months ago with the council but we had to stop it and refund the money. Obviously, the government allowed drive-thru grottoes to go ahead and we had six days to put it together. We didnapost get it one hundred per cent right yesterday. Lessons were learnt and the problems have been sorted out today. Mr Holland also disagreed saying with reviews, saying The Grinch did not look scary and that there was a lot of positive feedback about the character on the opening day.  I think he was fine, he said. He made people laugh. We have had good comments about him. I told him to not go too scary because normally they will pull up in front of you and pull at your wipers. But, he has been laughing and dancing. Marie Embling, who took her two kids to the drive-thru, said that it looked more like an abandoned fair. The -year-old from Brigg, North Lincolnshire, said: Donapost get me wrong for £. each I was not expecting the North Pole but I must admit we were left totally disappointed. We drove up to the first part that looked nothing less than an abandoned fair. Not sure what was meant to be happening in the inflatable grotto but nothing was there. In the globe there was certainly no snowstorm never mind Elsa as promised. We briefly saw the Grinch but it was raining so didnapost come out of his house. Highlights of the show were meant to include a snow blizzard with Frozen’s princess Elsa, which children were excited to see. But she was nowhere to be seen for the first few hours of the day. The East Hull mum continued: “That’s the first area. The Grinch sort of stalks your car for a bit and then you drive to Santa and get your gt bags then go. “Honestly, the whole thing was faster than a McDonald’s drive-thru. “That is literally it. The snow globe was not switched on and there was no Elsa as promised which my daughter was excited about. “Nothing was as described but I will say the Santa was authentic looking. It was fine, I can’t grumble about that.” Mr Holland says he was unfortunately let down on the day after a number of characters failed to turn up. He said: Mrs Claus didn’t turn up as she missed her bus and rang to say she couldn’t get here and I had to get someone  into the costume. Same with Elsa. She got her timing wrong and came after pm. It should have been earlier but apparently one of her kids was ill. It is the first day. I don’t like these comments but I know from everything I have done in the past that you are not going to please everyone. But I take on board everything and I am tweaking it.

Teah Vincent, , called the boy a liar and slammed stupid people who are judging her and spreading c*** about her after she was found not guilty of knowingly having sex with an underage boy.

Erika Becerra from Detroit was diagnosed with Covid- last month when she was eight months pregnant and ended up in hospital. She had reportedly told her mum: Mom, I don’t feel good. I don’t feel like myself. It’s hard to breathe. Erika gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Diego Antonio Becerra, on November . But her brother said she never got to bond with him before her condition deteriorated. Michael Avilez told WBTV: She had a normal labor. She gave birth to her son but didn’t get to hold him because right after she gave birth, that’s when they put the tube in.  Then, from there, she just started declining. Through the tears, Michael described how the family sat with her and prayed in her final devastating moments. He said all his sister wanted was the best for everybody, and she did not deserve what she went through.

The camera is looking down the dimly-lit hallway of the flat towards the kitchen, and at first glance it looks thereaposs nothing to see in the room but a few indistinguishable items which appear to have been left on the countertop. Hundreds of people on Reddit admitted they couldnapost see nothing of any concern - until they zoomed in. Once you spot it, the figure canapost be unseen, and one commented to say: I zoomed in and was thinking ‘ffs thereaposs nothing th....holy s***!apos and almost threw my iPad off my lap.A second said: I see nothing *zooms in* Holy f***, while another added: I did the same thing. Nope. Donapost like that. shudders. Many people stared at the photo and were still unable to see anything disturbing, and one advised: By the door, above the counter. Looks like a white transparent face peeking. When one comment said: If this isnapost fake then you definitely have a ghost, the man replied to say: Unfortunately itaposs not. I wish it was.  The post racked up more than , comments but not everyone was convinced, as some argued it looked like a mask and one said: Kind of weird, but unfortunately the door is open enough for someone to be standing behind it. Another believed the image had been edited, arguing: The resolution in the image is dferentonly in the area of the face . You can see that the way the pixels are rendered in just that area are dferent. Itaposs smoother looking than any other part of the entire image. Following the interest in the post, the man added an update to say: For a bit more context, I live with  friends but was home alone at the time of the picture. After taking it I checked [the] kitchen and found no one. I then checked every room after and no one  was in my house. Front door [was] locked and all windows were shut too. No idea whataposs happened. I didnapost think this would get any attention, but thank you to the ones who have shown concern. As an update, since seeing this, Iaposve been packing some stuff and preparing to go stay with my family.

The total death toll of those with confirmed infections now stands at ,.The first supplies of the Pfizer and BioNTech jab arrived in Scotland on Saturday and are being stored securely ahead of the first vaccinations on Tuesday.But tens of millions of doses manufactured in Belgium could be transported to the UK by airroad, rail and sea routes are subjected to widely expected disruption whether or not a trade deal can be agreed during crunch talks with the EU this week.Brexit negotiations resumed on Sunday in what was described as a #last throw of the dice# but some officials fear even changes outlined in a last-minute breakthrough would now see severe issues at ports and commercial airports in the weeks and months ahead.Appearing on the BBC#s Politics Scotland programme on Sunday, Ms Freeman confirmed military transport may also be needed for other medicines, including those used to treat the most severely ill patients in intensive care.She said: #That#s our understanding, is that the UK Government has made these contingency plans for the supplies in case Brexit does hold things up at ports.#At the moment they are coming in the normal way, but we certainly expect every step to be taken to ensure that supplies are not hindered by any kind of Brexit deal, including a no-deal Brexit, whatever it is.#We need to get these supplies, but we also need to get other medicines into the country. There are many important medicines, not least medicines that we use in ICU and our acute hospitals that we need to ensure come regularly.#Ms Freeman said it was the #intention# for those medicines to also be flown in, and discussions were ongoing at a UK level.Britain’s medical authorities approved the rollout of the Pfizer and BioNTech Covid- vaccine on Wednesday morning, paving the way for vaccination to start this week. The jab has been shown in studies to be % effective and works in all age groups.A trial of coronavirus testing for care home visitors will begin in facilities in Aberdeenshire and Fe on Monday but Ms Freeman was unable to say when all care home residents and staff who wish to receive the vaccine will be able to do so.The health secretary was also at the centre of confusion after refusing to rule out level four restrictions remaining in place for some areas of the country beyond December  # and then rowing back on her comments on social media.Ms Freeman said ministers would #take the right amount of time# to reach a judgement but would not rule out the toughest measures remaining in place for Christmas, despite Nicola Sturgeon repeatedly stating level four would be lted next week.The first minister previously said decisions about what tier areas in the central belt would be moved into, including possibly level two, would be made based on the latest data but insisted level four measures #will be lted on December #.Asked on Sundaysome level four areas could remain in that tier, Ms Freeman said: #All options are on the table at this point, as you would expect them to be. That doesn#t mean – people shouldn#t read from that any decision one way or the other.#The health secretary later said on Twitter that she had misspoke during the interview and that the position #has not changed#.#The Cabinet will decide on Tuesday what level below four they’ll go into,# she said. #My comments were intended to mean in respect of that decision, all options are on the table.#Scottish Conservative health spokesman, Donald Cameron, said #mixed messaging and confusion# from Ms Freeman on the issue #helps nobody as they plan to come out of the toughest restrictions#.#The questions she was asked could not have been clearer,# he said. #These restrictions affect millions of people and they deserve a clear and consistent message from SNP ministers.#Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon called for #immediate clarity# from the Scottish Government, adding: #This is no way to handle a pandemic#.Following the health secretary#s clarication, Ms Lennon added: “This is not the time for spin. Jeane Freeman muddled the message and should simply hold her hands up and apologise to those businesses and people living in level four.“The pandemic is far from over and people in Scotland need clear, consistent and reliable information from the Scottish Government at all times.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I do wish we had made it more comfortable, though.”Attacking midfielder McGowan was at the heart of everything good about the Dark Blues in the opening half and topped the performance with a goal of the season contender.Having run with the ball from the middle of the park, McGowan fired in from  yards with his outside of the foot shot clipping the post on its way into the net.“McGowan was fantastic, all our chances were coming through him and his goal was fantastic,” said McPake.“It reminded me of a similar goal he scored against United with the outside of his boot – he seems to hit it better with that. It was a great finish and I’m delighted for him.“Credit to Arbroath as well because they changed their system to deal with Paul McGowan in the second half – usually teams do that to deal with Charlie Adam.“It looked like it might be a nightmare for us and sometimes it takes a special goal to win a game.” vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The pandemic has highlighted the importance of developing a world-class health service.”She added: “We need to rebuild Scotland and restructure our economy, health and services around a values-based approach to eradicate inequality because that is what holds back our potential as a country.”Reflecting on his time as a local councillor when more resources were available to tackle local challenges, Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay said: “I don’t think we have moved at all on poverty and inequality in recent years and you cannot do muchyou are wiping out local government resources.”He added: “The eradication of poverty should be priority number one for the Scottish Government with everything scrutinised under that lens and ministers tested against that vision.”Outgoing Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins said: “We cannot expect to be taken seriously until we attack not only the symptoms but the underlying causes of poverty, which is not solely about not having enough money. That is a symptom but the cause of poverty lies underneath that.”He added: “The Child Poverty Act sets some really important targets butwe really believe in minimising or addressing poverty in Scotland then we must start by limiting the attainment gap.”Having known poverty, I am also aware that policy alone cannot eradicate it. I must use my freedom to pursue a sustainable future but our politicians have replaced relationships with regulations that limit liberty rather than loose it.I agree with the measures our politicians outline above but the one thing they fail to mention is the one thing they have all voted to restrict.Poverty thrives when it holds people in isolation because only those who are free can truly lay hold of their freedom. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I felt we were the better team by a mile in the second half.“They had a couple of counter-attacks and half-chances but we dominated the second half.“On another day we would have got a draw.”Attacker Ben Armour was a notable absentee from the Peterhead line-up after picking up a hamstring injury.Nicholls said: “We have been unfortunate with injuries. It is not an excuse.“We only get the players to training altogether once a week on a Tuesday.“We try to set out a game plan, but that gets scuppered when people are injured.“We got a phone call from Ben Armour on Friday, who would have been starting on Saturday, saying his hamstring wasn’t quite right.“That impacted on our preparation, but the players showed in the second half that they are more than capable of climbing the league.“It is about them putting that in place from the start of the game, not at half-time when we are - down.“We were really pleased with the second half performance, especially for young Lyall, who scored a superb goal.”The Blue Toon sit eighth in League One with six points from their opening seven matches ahead of the visit of East Fe to Balmoor this weekend.Nicholls added: “We are in a hard run of fixtures but we go into the East Fe game looking to continue the second half performance against Falkirk.“If we can implement that then we will give ourselves a really good chance.“They will be well organised as Darren Young’s sides always are.“We are at home so it will be up to us to try to get the win.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"   blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Saints, however, failed to harness the wind advantage and it was the home side who looked the more threatening in the early stages.Skipper Lewis Buchanan registered Saints first effort on goal in the th minute, cutting in from the right to send a well-struck shot just wide of the postage stamp corner.Saints manager Donald Black made early use of the agreed rolling substitutes policy, sending on Fraser MacFarlane in the th minute to replace Alan Buchanan in the centre forward#s role.It didn#t take MacFarlane long to make an impact and his neat turn on the edge of the D created the space for a right foot volley which arced away from the Red Star keeper#s right hand to nestle in the bottom corner and give Saints a st minute lead.Red Star cancelled out the Saints advantage on the stroke of half-time after good work on the right from Chris Hart took him all the way to the bye-line from where his cutback picked out Stuart MacLean on the six-yard line for an easy finish.With the wind gathering pace, a long second half was in prospect for Saints and it took the hosts just four minutes to capitalise on their controlled first half performance when central defender Ben Forbes poked home an Andy Weir right wing corner through a sea of legs.After Lewis Buchanan had headed a th minute Andy Weir left wing corner off the line, Weir#s follow up delivery from the opposite flank picked out right full back Coll McCallum eight yards out for the home side#s third goal.Red Star stretched their advantage still further on the hour mark when Ben Forbes whipped a wind assisted free-kick from the halfway line into the postage stamp corner giving Murdo MacKenzie no chance.After keeping the hosts at bay for  minutes, Saints conceded a fth goal with almost the last kick of the ball. Murdo MacKenzie did well to parry a dipping -yard Aaron Moore shot, but luck deserted the Saints keeper when the ball broke to Ewan Litster, who chipped over the stranded keeper into the unguarded net.With the rain coming horizontally, both sets of players were delighted to hear referee Jimmy Litster#s final whistle immediately after the restart signalling a stampede for the sanctuary of the ious cars and vans in the school car park."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters unravelling our deep origins","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We know that our early ancestors split from chimpanzees, our closest ape relative, around - million years ago , and that the first near-humans of our genusevolved in Africa at least . Myr.These forerunners eventually gave rise to us , but our knowledge of what happened between these dates is very limited, largely because fossilised remains are extremely rare.Common illustrations depicting how our upright posture, facial features and lack of body hair gradually evolved are based on few skeletons of ancient ancestors. Most notable is that of Lucy, a young female skeleton dating back to . Myr.Lucy was discovered in the Afar depression, Ethiopia, in , and was assigned to a species more primitive than ours , and named A. afarensis after her location. In the s a few teeth and bone fragments were found that proved to be similar to, but even older than, Lucy, dating from ^ Myr and called A. anamensis. it was assumed that Lucy was directly descended from this ancient primate.Not surprisingly, there was much excitement in the field when anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie discovered a near-complete skull of A. anamensis dating from approximately . Myr. He found the skull, simply known as MRD for now, during his fieldworks at Woranso-Mille, Ethiopia, in . As the oldest and most-complete skull of A. anamensis, this find allowed detailed comparison with Lucy’s species.There was general agreement that, like the illustration, our ancient ancestors descended one from another in a linear fashion. So most experts assumed that A. anamensis evolved directly into Lucy’s species.Haile-Selassie’s detailed study of MRD suggests, however, that the two species co-existed in Africa for at least , years, presumably with the potential for interbreeding. This undoubtedly shakes up previous thoughts and reshapes our understanding of Homo evolution.But only time will tell Haile-Salassie says he hopes to find the rest of MRD’s skeleton # and even earlier members of our Homo genus # which should certainly help unravel our deep past."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 17 congratulations and jubilations","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some applicants do not have English as their first language and Citizens Advice Bureauoffices have experience in obtaining advice via interpreters.Outreach clinics, centred in local area job centres, are also a feature of the CAB service and enable job centre staff to refer clients directly to a CAB Advisor based there for a day.Any cuts will increase the workload on CAB offices exponentially as thousands more may be made redundant, find they have no income of any kind, and turn to CAB for advice. Cuts will undoubtedly affect the vulnerable in our society immediately, with theIn cities such as Glasgow, the closure of offices would mean that many claimants could find it impossible to travel to other parts of the city and, in any case, with an already growing list of applicants those offices would soon be overwhelmed,they are not already.Several members of CAB staff have already been made redundant. I believe that more may follow without additional funding.In Glasgow alone, five offices face closure, though it is estimated that in excess of , people in Glasgow sought advice from these offices in the last year. This is likely to be the case in major cities around Scotland.Our petition calls on the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Government to provide urgent funding to Citizens Advice Scotland. It can be found on the Scottish Parliament website # petition number PE: Urgent funding for Citizens Advice Bureaux.Alistair S Stephen, by emailSir,The Covert Human Intelligence Sources Bill currently going through Westminster, dubbed the Spy Cop Bill, gives agencies including police, armed forces, HMRC, and even the Food Standards Agency permission to break the law with impunity.These agencies will be permitted to break international and domestic law in direct contravention of the Geneva Convention on human rights.Why is this legislation being brought in, and why are HMRC and the Food Standards Agency being given such powers  It is beyond belief that the majority of MPs actually voted for this bill.A clue may come from recent comments made by the home Secretary and endorsed by the prime minister about #leftie lawyers# and #do-gooders#, referring to human rights lawyers and refugee organisations.As for the Food Standards Agency, clues might come from the other very concerning bill in process at present which is the Internal Market Bill which contravenes the Good Friday Agreement and the devolution settlements for Scotland and Wales by undermining the authority of the devolved governments, as well as breaking an international treaty signed less than a year ago.This bill contains some deeply concerning clauses which would come under the remit of The Food Standards Agency which normally only has jurisdiction south of the border, but this bill would enable a UK trade minister to unilaterally overrule Scottish legislation on food safety standards to allow for a trade deal with the US, and the importation of sub-standard foods and food products.It is also the case that any UK minister or appointee would be able to overrule any Scottish legislation. This could affect all aspects of our lives.The Spy Cop Bill is a means of enforcing the Internal Market Bill by using the threat of underhand means. Thus piling illegality on illegality with regard to international law.We need to be very concerned on both counts.Amnesty International has already voiced its grave concerns, as have other international bodies and governments.Surely independence is now the best option for Scotland, where we can build a better, fairer nation for ourselves one that obeys international laws and respects the basic human rights of all its citizens, with a written constitution to ensure that no future Scottish government could ever impose such draconian legislation on the people of Scotland.Cecilia Rees , Lochgilphead.Sir,The Covid- pandemic continues to be exceptionally dficult for all of us, but has also led to crisis levels of #pet poverty# in the UK.PDSA is a charity that provides free and low cost vet care for those who struggle to pay treatment costs for their sick and injured pets.Since the first UK lockdown began, we’ve seen an overwhelming number of additional enquiries from pet owners who have hit hard times.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Businesses need to act now! This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Surely to goodness we should have a plan.#I am also quite annoyed that Fyne View has closed, because it cost a lot to get it up and running, so that is money down the drain.#The public want to have facilities in their area and we cannot have decisions made without proper focus on figures before us.#Fyne View was a Lochgilphead-based care facility for dementia sufferers which was revealed to have closed its doors in November.Caroline Cherry, head of adult services with the HSCP, responded: #I totally hear Ms Rhodick’s concerns. But the purpose of this paper is not to go over decisions that have been made, it is to look at the audit trail.#Ms Rhodick then said: #Councillor Gary Mulvaneyhas said that the decision has been taken and the report reiterates that.#But it didn’t matter how many times people pled with the board to listen and understand, especially in a smaller area like this.#The consultation was not a consultation. People were asked along for their views and officers turned and told the public what they were doing. They were putting the cart before the horse.#The community will be really angry as nobody is listening. The decision was made months ago with one public consultation. It should have been two or three to get proper feedback.#Officers said what was happening and it was an option that nobody knew about.#Everything has been massaged for the IJB’s benefit. They are not listening.#Councillor Mulvaney said in reply: #This paper is reiterating what we have already decided and we are reopening a debate we had a number of months ago.#We now have a board member going back through things to which officers are in no position to respond.#I know Ms Rhodick feels strongly about this issue but the decisions have been taken and you cannot make comments like those.#It is just not appropriate for a board member. I suggest we move on.#Ms Cherry’s report said it was produced with the aim of ensuring there is #clear oversight and assurance on decision-making# on Knapdale’s closure."},{"url":null,"title":"jads grand designs","story":"Kathie GrfithsUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

You can use our template letter to claim a refund from your credit card companya retailer goes bust.Can I claimI only paid a deposit You dont have to have paid the full amount on your credit card ndash the card company is liable evenyou made only part of the paymenton your card.Its the value of the goods youre buying thats key, not the amount paid on the card.Under Section , as long as the value of the product is between pound and pound, then youll be covered, regardless of how much you paid on your card.So, for example,you ordered a new camera and paid a pound deposit with your credit card and paid the balance of pound by cheque, youd be covered for the whole poundthe company went out of business and you didnt get your camera.Can I still use my gt vouchers after a company has gone into administration A number of high street stores have refused to allow customers to use gt vouchers after going into administration. Unfortunately, this is within the law.But,the administrator takes this decision its worth waiting a few days to seeit will change its mind.If your gt vouchers are refused, you need to make a claim in writing to the administrators with proof of your vouchers.You can find the name of the administrator on the website of the retailer that has gone into administration.But theres no guarantee youll get all of your money back, and it could take up to  months to process the claim properly. And, not all administrators will take this approach.If you want to get your money back, you can use our template letter to claim a refund for vouchers from a bust company.Can I make a chargeback claim for gt vouchers If a company is accepting gt vouchers then chargeback claims will not be accepted.If gt vouchers arent being accepted and you bought gt vouchers on your card, you should be able to put in a chargeback request to your bank on the grounds that the vouchers are fundamentally dferent from what you paid for.This is because you expected to be able to exchange the vouchers for goods of a certain value and instead theyre worthless.If the vouchers were given to you as a gt, its trickier to make this argument. The person who received a voucher as a gt cant make a claim.But the person who bought the vouchers could put in a chargeback request to the bank. You can use our letter template to help you make a chargeback claim.Its worth noting though, that theres no guarantee the administrators will accept chargeback claims.Can I get my cashback If you were supposed to get cashback as part of your purchase, it depends on how the cashback offer was set up - you may still receive it.Check the terms and conditions to see whether the offer is backed by the manufacturer , or whether the cashback claim should be made to the retailer.If the manufacturer is providing the cashback, your claim shouldnt be affected.If its the retailer, you could still put in a claim and they would be in breach of contractthey didnt send the cash.If you didnt get the cash, unfortunately, you couldnt take court action against the retailer while its in administration.If at the end of the administration the retailer stopped trading, youd need to lodge your claim for unpaid cashback with the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-nearly-300-cases-past-month","story":"NEARLY  cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders over the past month.Data published by the Scottish Government at pm todayshows the Borders has recorded  new cases in the last  hours, bringing the regional total since March to .On November , a total of  cases had been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic, meaning that, in the space of a month, the Borders has recorded  new cases.:Coronavirus: Borders school announces positive caseIn Scotland, the total number of cases since March now stands at ,.In the last  hours across Scotland, there have been  deaths where COVID-has been mentioned on the death certicate.In the Borders, the number of patients in hospital with the virus has increased since yesterdayfrom nine to ."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-mcdonalds-reveals-number-jobs-available","story":"McDONALDrsquoS has revealed the number of jobs that will be created once its new Borders site opens.As reported last week, a new restaurant and drive-thru will be coming to Hawickafter plans were approved by Scottish ministers.The fast food giant has now revealed that ldquoat least  new jobs will be created.:Galashiels loses crown as happiest place to live in ScotlandA McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore delighted that our plans for a new drive-thru restaurant in Hawick have been approved.ldquoWe look forward to opening our doors in the near future, bringing signicant investment to the local community and creating at least  new jobs.The Hawick site on Commercial Road, where the McDonaldrsquos is to be built, will also see a BM store added.There is currently one McDonaldrsquos store in the Borders, which opened in Galashiels in .You might also be interested in:Coronavirus: Borders recorded nearly  casesin the last monthTwo Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesCoronavirus: Borders school announces positive case"},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-knowepark-primary-school-announces-coronavirus-case","story":"AN ENTIRE class at a Borders school has been forced to self-isolate following a coronavirus case.On Sunday , parents of pupils in the P P composite class at Knowepark Primary School, Selkirk, were informed of a positive case at the school.The NHS Test and Protect team identied the whole class as being in close contact with the case, and all pupils were therefore required to self-isolate.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Councilsaid that three other schools in the Borders have also reported cases recently.:Two Borders high schools in top  in Scotland, says Sunday TimesHawick High School and Galashiels Academyhave each announced a single case, while Ayton Primary School has \"a small number of cases\", according to the spokesperson.The spokesperson said cases associated with Ayton Primary School have \"implications for a number of iniduals within the school\".\"Currently no [Ayton] pupils [are] required to self-isolate,\" the spokesperson added.Parents at Hawick High School and Galashiels Academy were informed of cases on November , and parents of children at Ayton Primary School were told about cases on November ."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-scotrail-offers-students-50-per-cent-discount-get-home-christmas","story":"SCOTRAIL has announced that students travelling home over Christmas will benefit from a fty per cent discount on tickets from Scotlandrsquos Railway.A mass testing programme of students planning to head home over the festive period is currently under way, in a bid to limit risk of transmission and provide reassurance to those travelling home to their families and loved ones.And now students will only need to pay half price for travel, on any ScotRail service until December .The train operator, run by Dutch firm Abellio, hopes the move will help students worried about getting home to their families under the current coronavirus travel restrictions.Students will first need to record a negative Covid- test before travelling, which could make it dficult to book specic train services due to testing appointments and the time spent awaiting results.Herersquos a little Christmas cheer for all of Scotlandrsquos university students.

GBPUSD slipped from . overnight to . in early trade, a chunky move to start the session and reflective of both the poundrsquos sensitivity to headlines and the severe downside risks from a no-deal Brexit.Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove will meet his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee in Brussels on Monday, the UK Government said.A spokesman said: ldquoThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will meet vice presidentSefcovic today in Brussels to discuss issues related to their work as co-chairs of the Withdrawal Agreement joint committee.ldquoThe Withdrawal Agreement joint committee oversees UK and EU implementation, application and interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Protocol.ldquoThe work of the joint committee is separate from the ongoing FTA negotiations.Following their earlier call on Saturday, Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen acknowledged that there are still ldquoserious dferences to be resolved on fisheries and the mechanism for resolving disputes as well as competition rules.While the two sides have been circling round the same issues for months, it is unclear whether the intervention of the leaders has created the political space for the negotiators finally to bridge the gap.What is agreed is that time is rapidly running out.If there is no deal by the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of the month, then Britain will leave the single market and the customs union and begin trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, with the imposition of tarfs and quotas.Before then it has to be ratied by both Houses of Parliament in the UK and the European Parliament as well as signed off by the EU leaders.There had been hopes that could happen at a two-day summit in the Belgian capital starting on Thursday ndash their final scheduled gathering of the year ndash but the timetable is looking increasingly tight.France has publicly warned that it will veto any dealit is unhappy with the terms, amid signs President Emmanuel Macron is anxious that Mr Barnier is preparing to give too much ground in his determination to get a deal..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Michel Barnier gives  ugloomy u assessment of post-Brexit trade deal progress"},{"url":null,"title":"a physically distanced return to pilates","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

So there will be one window on st December , two windows on December  and so on – and they should stay in place until Twelfth Night.Everyone is invited to walk or drive around the parishes and spot the decorated windows. A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation.

Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder. We wonder what level our area will be in, we wonder what level our family and friends will be in, we wonderwe will be able to see them or have them in our homes or go to their homes.We wonder. We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising star lights up the night","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He decided to light his pipe but unfortunately he also lit his beard which caused quite a panic. However, Santa was none-the-worse and still delivers presents today.#The group#s charitable giving not only benefitted the Kintyre community but also a nine-year-old Nigerian girl called Cecilia Wanjurta, whose seven-year education and boarding at a special school for the deaf was sponsored by Kintyre Round Table.Before attending the special school, Cecilia, who suffered from severe bilateral nerve deafness, attended a pre-primary school.

This is true for retail, those trading in consumer goods, services and investment, construction and housing as well as vehicle and haulier firms. The UK Government has put a raft of measures in place for all firms across England, Scotland and Wales. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said: “We are leaving the EU single market and customs union. This will bring both new challenges and new opportunities for businesses. We recognise this is a challenging time for everyone. We are determined to support businesses to be ready for  January  and beyond. ”These are actions to take now#Procurement expert Laura Hobbs has led the way for the construction industry to prepare for the end of the UK transition period. Laura is the UK and Ireland One Procurement Programme Lead at Royal BAM Group, which is among the biggest construction firms covering England, Wales and Scotland. She said: “We have created a snapshot to give a clear picture for the industry where we believe pinch points are.” Laura explained: “I decided to pull my peers together, all the other main contractors that are part of the Construction Senior Leaders Group which I chair. We decided to write one set of questions for the end of UK transition and also share the workload – to go to all those dferent product categories key to construction.“As main contractors we deal a lot with sub-contractors so we need to ensure the message gets further into the supply chain.”The Construction Senior Leaders Group also includes representatives from Skanska, Costain, Murphys, Laing O’Rourke, housebuilders Berkeley and clients including Highways UK and Clarion Housing Group. Manufacturers are employing new customs experts to help them get in position for the new start, creating more strategic programmes to negate any currency fluctuations. Laura worked with Build UK, receiving useful information around imports and exports from the UK Government. “Information is the key and preparation is essential. The organisations we work with have been preparing for this for a long time so they are on their final rehearsal now. “To be able to give your own business the comfort you are going into this in a planned, coordinated way, it is key for people to start the exercise sooner rather than later,” stressed Laura. She said the new start will bring opportunities to invest in the UK supply chain. “We always see the positives and, definitely for the UK, there are opportunities coming.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

There are probably no more than half-a-dozen casks of -year-old Scotch whisky in existence.It is the habit at Springbank to reserve small quantities of whisky for longer than normal maturity. Although  years is not so very uncommon,  years is exceptional.The particular cask was ‘refill sherry hogshead’ which was filled on December  , with Springbank at a strength of . over proof .It originally contained the equivalent of . proof gallons but more than  years later, maturation had taken most of the spirit away: there was only the equivalent of . proof gallons left, and the strength had dropped to . proof.The out-turn of the bottling operation was  cases and one bottle. These will have a special label and each numbered bottle will carry a certicate inidually signed by the company’s chairman Mr Hedley G Wright, whose great-grandfather founded the present company. Unfortunately it is improbable that any of this whisky # after all there are only  bottles # will be seen by the retail trade the price would be astronomical anyway.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOIslay distilleriesLast working season was a prosperous one for the Islay distilleries, as well as for Highlands distilleries generally.During the summer great activity has been seen in the numerous arrivals of vessels with coal and barley and preparations were made for a resumption of distilling.Wet weather, scarcity of labour and a scarcity of carts made the securing of peats very dficult, and only the dry autumn relieved the situation and allowed the peats to be got home. At Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Port Ellen, Port Charlotte, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain and Caol Ila work is now actively going on, and large deliveries are leaving the district.Highland distillers, however, have now to face the competition again of the distillers of grain whisky, which is now plentul on the market. The Distillers Co Ltd quotes its grain whisky at five shillingsper gallon and with all the high costs of wages, coal repairs etc which encumber the malt distillers, the competition is likely to be severely felt."},{"url":null,"title":"law book not just for legal eagles","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After hearing from Katrina, Ian started looking for wild turkey tail mushroom and finally discovered some, growing on a log in a garden in Southend.He asked Frances Hill from Muneroy Tearoom whose house it was and she, in turn, asked the ownersome of the mushrooms could be harvested, explaining what it would be used for.The owners, Mark and Sadie, were only too happy for Ian to collect some, which he delivered to retired herbalist Kenneth Eames, who has been shielding for  months.Kenneth said: #I went on a mushroom hunt with Ian about  years ago and we#ve remained friends since.

Susan had been previously unaware of it and so decided to go find it with her husband.When they got there, the tide was helpfully out, revealing the pool. She took some photos and a film of it, but when she ed home and looked at the film, she felt sure she could see a ghostly image in the water of the pool.This led Susan to research images of Lady Helen Hall and she reckoned the image looked like her. Was it a ghostly apparition in the water or a trick of the light  Well, people can make their own mind up, but for me, Susanrsquos message made me curious to find this pool and learn more about Lady Hall, after which it is named.So we made it a family weekend trip of discovery, which usually take place within the boundaries of East Lothian even in the best of times so this was perfect. Bilsdean and nearby Dunglass are favourite places of mine, as you will knowyou read my column regularly. Despite the busy A passing through, the whole area has a fascinating history and the walk following the burn down Bilsdean Glen has an enchanting waterfall. Reaching this walk from the village is hazardous, however, as an unsafe crossing over the fast-flowing A is required, so much care is neededyou go this way.We didnrsquot have much time. The timetable of the tides was against us, as was the dying light of a winterrsquos afternoon. However, we managed to reach the beach with just enough light and time to have our adventure. Susan and David were waiting for us and we made our distanced greetings and they headed in front to seethe pool had been uncovered by the receding tide.This part of the coast is utterly fascinating. There is a lot of erosion here, and whenever I come I see new geological features and wonder about them. Irsquom no geologic expert, but Irsquom sure we spotted a chunk of ancient volcanic lava which seems to have solidied in mid flow a moment in Earthrsquos story from millions of years ago.It was from near here, of course, that the geologist James Hutton was taken in  by Sir James Hall, Lady Hallrsquos husband, on a boat ride to nearby Siccar Point, and the rest, as they say, is history.But it wasnrsquot to retell the story of already-well-known men from history that we made this trip. It was to discover a place associated with a woman who, despite her achievements and talents, was ignored by history, as most women have been until recently.It was indeed an adventure to find her pool, for we had to scramble over wet rocks to get there. Our young children took it in their stride and my youngest Lewis was looking out for evidence of dinosaurs. There are steps cut in the rocks nearby and so I suspect Lady Hall had a more convenient route to reach her pool, but we had no time to search for that.When we arrived at the pool, the tide was not fully out so it was still partly submerged, but enough was revealed of the cut rock to show the outline of Lady Hallrsquos Pool. I could just see what looked like the small steps cut by its side.Susan and David told me of the local tradition that she would come down to bathe in the sea water. Perhaps this was frowned upon, given it was the th century and she was a lady of high aristocratic status. But the story goes that her determination to regularly bathe in the sea led to the creation of this pool, which captures the sea as it goes out, making it a safer place to swim in this rocky coastline.I did not know of this pool before Susan contacted me, and I knew next to nothing about Lady Hall, she was just another aristocratic name. But now, as I stood on the edge of the pool which bears her name, I became intrigued as I listened to the story.I saw no ghostly image of Lady Hall in the water, yet I felt her presence in the twilight. The sun had already vanished from the sky and a beautul moon was rising above the sea. It was cold but calm a perfect moment for a ghostly introduction. While I had not seen Lady Hall with my eyes, I now felt we had been introduced by her story, thanks to Susan.We chatted on ourabout stories and the importance of enchantment and magic when growing up. Susan and her husband had given my family a winterrsquos afternoon of discovery and adventure. Two-hundred years separate Susan and Lady Helen Hall, but there was a connection between them. Two remarkable women from the area who shared a love of the landscape and the stories itrsquos steeped in.And now I must source the book Lady Hall ndash Lang-heidit Lady, written by another local woman, Sally Wilson. She spent years researching the le of Lady Hall and, based on the titbits Irsquove managed to see, it looks fascinating.But I will alsoto the pool. There may be other stories attached to it, and now our story is part of it too. We plan toin the summer, when the tide is out, and have a swim.That is,the ghost of Lady Hall isnrsquot in it already!"},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-1-4-1995-1970-1920","story":"A FAMILY managed to get to safety following an early-morning fire in their home, reported the East Lothian Courier on December , .A teenager rescued his family from their smoke-logged home in Tranent in the early hours of Tuesday morning as fire raged in their lounge.Gareth Johnston, , stopped his terried sister Kerry, , from leaping out of the bedroom window and led her and his mum Jackie to safety with clothes thrown over their heads as protection against the fumes.When the family had escaped down the narrow stairway and were out of their home in Farsquoside Crescent, Gareth ed to save Gem, their pet Jack Russell, who was trapped in the kitchen at the back of the house.Yesterday , Jackie spoke of the familyrsquos ordeal and said that they probably owed their lives to Garethrsquos prompt action.ldquoWe were lucky to escape, she said.EAST Lothian residents were happy about the scrapping of British Standard Time ndash a three-year experiment of the country staying on British Summer Time all year round ndash as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .Farmers and building workers in East Lothian heaved a sigh of relief this week when the decision toto Greenwich Mean Time was announced.Parents and schoolteachers too were equally jubilant about a change which will eliminate many road hazards for young children.The decision to reject British Standard Time after a three-year experimental period was the result of a free vote in the House of Commons on Wednesday.In its later stages, the debate was largely dominated by Scots members, most of whom were strongly opposed to its retention.lsquoWIVES Fall Outrsquo was a headline in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .In Haddington Sherf Court, on Friday, Ann Robertson or Black, we of John Black, miner, Prestonpans, was charged with having, on th October, in Pyperrsquos Wynd, assaulted Jessie Mackenzie or Moody, we of Robert Moody, miner.An agent, in tendering a plea of guilty, stated that the complainer had unjustly accused his client of having removed some clothes from a rope, and that this was the cause of the quarrel.The result was that she had given Mrs Moody a slap on the face.The Fiscal said he did not think the assault was of a serious nature, and, perhaps, as the agent had suggested, it might not be necessary to impose any penalty."},{"url":null,"title":"world-boxing-champion-josh-taylor-gets-engaged-danielle-murphy","story":"The undefeated star got down on one knee in front of his long-time girlfriend Danielle Murphy yesterdaywhile on a luxury yacht in Dubai.Danielle took to social media this morningto say: ldquo  , the day I said YES.ldquoOne of the best days of my le, Josh pulled out all the stops and I couldnrsquot have asked for a better day!ldquoThank you to everyone for the well wishes and love, Irsquom totally overwhelmed!ldquoItrsquos times like this that I wish heaven had a phone so I could phone big Jimmy [her late father] to tell him my best friend has made me the happiest girl on the planet.Josh, originally from Prestonpans but now living in Haddington, is the current holder of the WBA and IBF World Super Lightweight titles.The -year-old is expected to step into the ring with Jose Carlos Ramirez, who holds the WBC and WBO World Super Lightweight titles, in the spring for a unication bout.Josh also previously took gold at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in  before turning pro.He also posted on social media, saying: ldquoSo she just said yes.ldquoI finally plucked up the courage to ask my beautul girlfriend to be my we.

You sat around talking cobblers with someone from the NME or Mojo and that was the way you got them to understand a band, and that ends up with them getting the cover.\"I think its always done like that. Some will say, Lets go for lunch at the Ivy. That wasnt the way we did it. We had a load of cans in the fridge. Each to their own.\"Whatever the case, it has certainly worked. Some  years on from its first release, The World According to Sly  Lovechild, released in the summer of , and, as remixed by the late Andrew Weatherall, sounding very much of its time, Heavenly Recordings is still growing strong. These days its home to such Music favourites as Katy J Pearson, Baxter Dury and Working Mens Club.The secret of the labels success  \"I dont think its ever been afraid to take risks and follow an instinct,\" Turner suggests, \"eventhe instinct is completely outside what anyone would expect.\"It was ever thus. Heavenly was born at the height of acid house. Indeed, it might not even existit hadnt been for acid house. And yet, just to be contrary, one of labels first signings was a Welsh punk band. Yes, it was Barrett who gave us the Manic Street Preachers, releasing their first incendiary singles Motown Junk and You Love Us.In its early days, Heavenly was home to Saint Etienne and Flowered Up but also to a country band from Camden, The Rockingbirds. In the years that followed it signed future Paloma Faith and Sophie Ellis-Bextor collaborator Ed Harcourt and anthemic rock band Doves and The Magic Numbers. That leftfield thinking continues through to the present day. Heavenly is where you will find the likes of Stealing Sheep and Gwenno who sings in both Welsh and Cornish. In short, iety is in the labels DNA.What is a Heavenly band anyway  \"I think its people who know themselves,\" suggests Turner. \"If you think about a band like the Manics, early on they knew exactly who they were. And someone like Gwenno, now, she knows exactly who she is. She was someone who had a successful album in the Welsh language and at the point where she is going to record a second album, when there are a lot of eyes on her, she decides to do it in Cornish. You think thats crazy but as she says,she cant do it then, is she ever going to get the chance to do it again \"The Heavenly backstory goes like this. Jeff Barrett had been working for Alan McGees Creation label ndash his first job there was to tour-manage The Jesus and Mary Chain around Europe when the band were playing -minute sets much to the horror of promoters ndash when he discovered acid house and met Andrew Weatherall. Oh, and he was also sacked as Primal Screams press agent. And thenBarrett set up Heavenly Recordings.It was very much of the moment, Turner suggests. Acid House had created a new economy. People were going out every night of the week. \"Maybe they ended up becoming drug dealers, maybe they became promoters, maybe they became people who ran record labels. It just presented a whole new set of possibilities.\"There werent DJs before. There were people who put on She Sells Sanctuary at your local night club at  oclock at night. But there werent people whose name you knew, who you went to go and see and follow. Acid House created a new template and Heavenly was part of that. It ersied, but thats the spirit of Acid House as well. Its not staying put in one thing for too long.\"How much of the label is a reflection of Barrett  \"Completely. Its very much down to him, but within the label everyone is allowed to bring in mad ideas. And quite often the mad ideas are the things that you maybe talk about in the pub and then, a couple of pints in, you think: this is brilliant. And then its getting into the office the next day and running with those ideas. Thats the space he allowed to happen.\"Over the years, Heavenly Recordings has been home to guitar bands, singer-songwriters, dream pop, electronica and pretty much every other music genre. And for a label based in London there is a surprisingly large Scottish connection. Heavenly has put out records by Dot Allison, Jock Scott, The Nectarine No  and even Edwyn Collins.\"Theres always been a Scottish connection. It also has a really big Welsh contingent and recently a really big Australian contingent. Weirdly, the thing that has been lacking ndash apart from Flowered Up, The Rockingbirds and possibly Saint Etienne who are from just outside ndash is London-based bands.But, he adds, \"I dont think anybody is bothered that they missed out on the Libertines.\"There were other bands who got away, though, perhaps most notably The White Stripes, who the label failed to land because those up the chain couldnt see the appeal. \"You had people in EMI going, I cant see that thats ever going to sell silver. It doesnt f****** matter. The record is great. It doesnt matter what it sells.\"The thing that has helped the label over the last decade, Turner suggests, is the fact that it has been properly independent. \"When I was there it was always an affiliate of a major label. It started off with Sony, then it became BMG, and then it was EMI.\" As a result, he says, \"you are kind of hamstrung. If it was EMI and there was a Coldplay record coming your record had to get out of the way. Andthe Coldplay record goes back they then look to move something into that hole in the schedule, which is why the second Magic Numbers album was kind of rushed. And it didnt help it at all.\"Now, being completely independent, you dont need to worry about huge artists coming in and taking up the bandwidth, as it were. It also means they can be pretty nimble.\"So, when David Holmes turned up with a single recorded with Sinead OConnor with profits being donated to the Black Lives Matter movement earlier this year Heavenly was able to put it out quickly.For Turner, Barrett remains the labels secret weapon. He is why,  years on, Heavenly Recordings is still going strong.ldquoThe person who signed Flowered Up and Saint Etienne is still the person signing Gwenno and Sinead OrsquoConnor.

By the end of November she was already worried about how she could stock up on items on the MS Christmas list. Then she found that she couldnrsquot get an MS delivery slot this side of New Year anyway. Irsquove heard the same story about other supermarket chains.How did she resolve this  By going to a physical store, buying what she thought shersquod need, intending to freeze it, only to find that because of all the bulky packaging, it wouldnrsquot all fit in.ldquoWhy did I do this  shersquos now asking herself. ldquoItrsquos only one day of the year, after all.The explanation, we agree, is that women feel under extraordinary food, and therefore emotional, pressure at Christmas. They fret about meeting their familyrsquos expectations, and weeks-long Christmas food advertising campaigns pump up that anxiety. These adverts work as effectively on women as the Christmas toy equivalent work on children.And this year, the annual festive food pressure dial has been turned up to maximum setting. Memories of bare supermarket shelves during the first lockdown haunt us. The feeling that we must, against all odds, make this a successful Christmas to reassure ourselves, and our nearest and dearest, that deep down, everything is fine.Apologies to those relatively few men who take on the responsibility for planning and providing, but this is heavy burden that mainly women feel.Of course, this festive anxiety is orced from reality. There are shops other than supermarkets, independent shops. They usually sell better food, and they donrsquot run out. There are any number of smaller producers and distributors of first-rate food who would be delighted to have our online business.So letrsquos try to keep a cool head. Wersquove had enough panic this year already.Just remember that anyone who cooks, or who has any feeling for food whatsoever, can come up with something that is better quality and more delicious than those over-hyped supermarket reheats that never look, or taste, anywhere near as good as the enticing picture on the box."},{"url":null,"title":"food-tricks-trade-former-bake-off-winner-john-whaite","story":"John Whaite, winner of the  series, set up his quaint cookery school in Lancashire in . A small group of us gatherin the delectable converted barn, whipping up chocolate silk pies with pear and caramel, cherry crumble blondies and the best carrot cake Ive ever tasted. Here are some of the things I learned on the way.... If your cake batter curdles - or any mixture splits when using fat, pop it over a bain-marieand whisk vigorously. If youre using a KitchenAid, warm the bowl with a blow torch, and then whisk. Do this quickly though - you dont want your mixture lurking over the hot water for too long.. When putting pastry in the fridge, flatten it into a disk, rather than balling it into a boulder, so you dont have to turn a big ball into a flat disk later.. If your pastry shrinks in the oven, it means youve overworked it. Start again!. Use a toothbrush to create pretty splashes when youre icing a cake.. Roast damsons in the oven and use them to make jam. The stones squeeze out easily after being roasted, and you can use the juice in your cake frosting .. Use a hot kne to slice your cakes up - this works especially well for fridge-cooled gooey brownies. Warm your kne up by dipping it in hot water.. To stop an icing-sugar dust cloud, mix the butter and icing sugar with the paddle by hand, pressing it down, before turning your mixer on.. Use egg yolk, a tiny splash of water and a pinch of salt for the perfect egg wash.. Use acrylic rods when rolling out pastry to ensure its the perfect thickness all the way through.. Always leave scone dough to rest - it takes  mins for the baking powder to get to work, to relax the gluten and give you soft, pillowy scones.. Weigh your liquid ingredients - jug measurements arent always right.. When you make pastry or dough, mix it in your mixer to start with, but bring it together by hand for a perfectly smooth consistency.. When making sweet pastry, use sugar not icing sugar. Icing sugar can make the pastry rubbery.. Use white sugar when making caramel, not golden, because its more refined, so there are fewer bits in it that might crystallise.. Use rice for blind baking, not baking beans - its cheaper!. When making carrot cake , grate your carrots into a clean tea towel and squeeze out any excess water. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on the grated carrot to help absorb even more.. Use paperclips to secure your baking paper to the pans - this stops it blowing around in a fan oven.. If your pastry breaks when you roll it out, simply give it a very quick knead, then put plenty of flour down and roll it out again. Have a pastry brush on hand to dust off any excess flour.. Le is too short to make your own puff pastry. Use ready-rolled, so long as its all-butter.For more information on John Whaites Kitchen, or to book a cookery course, visit johnwhaiteskitchen."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-coming-new-dawn-suffused-happiness-give-thanks","story":"I electronically raise my shutters and myself, and look out to the still darkness and watch it gradually change content with its progress.Nurses come and go in a choreographed routine ndash pills, thermometer reading and then breakfast of good bread, butter, jam and cold, cold orange juice.

Often, I would stand at the open French windows, shivering slightly in the mist which seemed a daily morning occurrence where we are.I would range my eyes from the distant village church glimpsed through the now bare upright arms of the woods over to the crossroads ing into the valley or turning towards Lavit.And I would listen to heavy silence broken only by the rush of Cesarrsquos body racing back from his check of the land that all had been well in the night.And that mist, like the hospital darkness, would dissipate toohellipslyly sneaking away to let the weak light come forth and the sky show its glory.Then, vaguely discontented and already bored, I would make a cappuccino from a sachet, open the computer and begin the morning read of the papers.Ah,I had only known what was rushing towards me, already multiplying and festering in my cells, how much more would I have relished such mundanities.Perhaps thatrsquos why I now waken with such surreal happiness because now I know.The serenity and the certitude grow less and less as afternoon turns into frighteningly early evening and darkness falls and I press the shutters for theirdownward journey.It depends what the next day holds as to how quickly the mood evaporates and the demonsto bicker and debate in my brain.Rosemary Gorings Country Le: steering a safe route towards winterAfter a break, the doctors are to give me immunotherapy tomorrow and I dread what may follow with a visceral fear. Towards the end of the month, now having been measured for the mask, I will have ten consecutive days of preventative radiation focused on the brain. That fills me with fear too in case something is lsquolostrsquo in the power of the radiation.And they now no longer feel I should be in London. They believe I should continue and end my treatment here so that there can be no risk of any delay at the other end.Logically I agree with them until I speak to my son who wants to come, sweep me up and into the Marsden who he says will immediately continue treatment.But Irsquove lived too long not to know that le does not always run on linear lines and much is out with our control at times. Pierce feels betrayed by me I think although I assure him I am committed to Londonhellipwhen able.I understand ndash he has worked so hard to ensure my acceptance there and has such faith in them, not so much in France. He is filled with impotent frustration and sees me dying faster than I still see me living.Unfortunately, these conversations take place mid evenings when I begin to ebb and nothing seems certain or too hopeful and he leaves me with too many what s for a restful run up to sleep.Today too I went across to the unit I must move to and depression has descended with the night. An older building, the rooms are smaller and uglier, the corridors narrow and scuffed and I felt Irsquod been cast out of Paradise.But after treatments I need the presence of nursing care day and night and for this, the way the French system works, I will have to pay  euros a month.The same high standards and protocols apply the food comes from the same kitchen and my boiled eggs are safe. But the nursing teams are dferent and I will leave behind the great kindness of those who have cared for me all these months.The ones who know my foibles the necessity of plugs and placements for my Mac and phone the chair or table to hold them all.However, for now, for a few hours on the good days, starting with the coming of the dawn, I am suffused with happiness and for that I give thanks.

It is obviously a welcome accolade for the town to have this recognition as being at the top in certain aspects of modern communications.What is perhaps less well known in terms of communications is it is reported that in the th century, when postal services were growing signicantly , the council in the town decided that the name to be used for Council business should be changed from \"Inverury\" to \"Inverurie\", because so many letters addressed \"Inverury\" were going to Inverary in Argyll.

But it was not to be.Last week, the Scottish Government effectively signed BiFabs death warrant. This in the very week that Boris Johnson announced a dramatic further increase in targets for the reduction of UK emissions, most of which will be achieved through offshore wind.:Over poundm of taxpayers money face being lost as ministers rule out nationalisation of collapsed BiFabSo much for the green jobs revolution. Scotlands major hope for getting a poundbn slice of the renewable energy action has gone south.This is a major political scandal, and rightly condemned by a vote of the Scottish Parliament last week. BiFab has not one but two major windfarms on its very Fe doorstep: the Seagreen array off Angus and Neart na Goailthe . These poundbn projects together had contracts out for at least  full Methil jackets.It beggars belief that BiFab was unable to get any of this work, despite a poundm bung to its Canadian owners JV Driver.Instead, the French state-owned energy giant, EDF, will build them mostly in Asian yards and have them dragged , miles by diesel tugs.A jaunty-sounding Fiona Hyslop, the Scottish Economy Secretary, told Good Morning Scotland that her hands were tied by Brussels competition rules. Too bad. Lessons to be learned etc.. But arent we supposed to be leaving the EU  Why would they have any say in the matter It would be ldquonaive, she replied, to believe that these state aid restrictions will not continue in some form. Well,so, why did the Scottish Government pony up so much cash in the first place If Scotland is the Saudi Arabia of renewables, BiFabs loss is surely a national humiliation. No other country would countenance such industrial defeatism, certainly not Norway which now has a substantial stake in renewables.The Scottish Government has merely acquired a track record for pouring public money into lost causes from Prestwick Airport to Ferguson Marine. This confirms that civil servants and politicians are just not very good at business. They dont understand it.They leap into action chasing favourable headlines by promising cash injections, only to stand aside thereafter as it gets burnt by private sector companies whorsquoll never turn away free money.What Scotland lacks is a coherent overall industrial strategy, or any industrial strategy. We hear homilies about building back better and making the economy work ldquofor people not profit instead of just making it work.The Scottish Government had the option of taking over BiFab at next to no cost, but declined on the basis that a nationalised BiFab would still be hamstrung by European competition rules.This is a reminder that however much SNP likes to talk left and talk green, at least when trying to enlist support at elections time, it is no more socialist than New Labour or even Boris Johnson.:Anger as part Scottish Government-owned BiFab files for administrationPerhaps less so, now that the Tory government has essentially taken half the British workforce onto the public payroll and borrowed more money faster than even Jeremy Corbyn intended.No one wants to live in a communist state, but we have the right to expect the Scottish Government to have an activist industrial policy that puts Scotland first.That may sound like Donald Trump, but he wasnt wrong about the need to challenge corporate globalisation and labour arbitrage ndash that is, companies exporting jobs to low-wage countries and destroying the domestic industrial base.Ms Hyslop lamented that Scotland couldnt compete with workers being paid pound. an hour in China or Indonesia. But it beggars belief that Scotland couldnt secure some guarantees from EDF that local, sustainable industry should be part of the supply chain. The Scottish Government has many planning powers and licenses these mega windfarms in the first place.Every year Nicola Sturgeon makes inflated promises abut a green jobs revolution.

The original Peterhead Carbon Capture and Storage project was going to use old mine shafts to sequester carbon dioxide. That was axed in  by the UK Government.Then there was Pelamis, which developed the first commercial wave power machine at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. Gone. The UKs only wind turbine tower manufacturer, CS Wind in Campbeltown, effectively shut up shop in August.Few are aware that Scotland had one of Europes leading environmental bus manufacturers in Alexander Dennis in Falkirk ndash but not for much longer.

But words are cheap.Where is the network of charging points for electric vehicles  What about replacing dirty diesel busses and trucks  Alexander Dennis designed clean hydrogen and electric buses, but has just axed  jobs.It rather looks asthe green jobs revolution is going to amount to more dodgy home insulation schemes, some trees, and a forest of green lobbyists surrounding shiny-bottom bureaucrats at interminable conferences on COP.We hear pious lectures from ministers about how we should be cycling and not using cars, while they travel around in their ministerial Lexuses. Local governments like Edinburgh are doing their best to reduce car journeys in the city through a campaign of permanent roadworks and guerilla pedestrianisation.Yet, bus travel has been declining fast, down % over the last  years, and that was before Covid. Until the pandemic, cycling was also in decline over the same period.Where is the smart public transport system with through ticketing and computerised, integrated rail and bus services  The only signicant urban transport investment recently was the ruinously expensive Edinburgh tram taking ldquohigh value folk from Princes Street to Edinburgh Airport.The Scottish Government will say that Scotland isnt an industrial powerhouse like America or China or UAE and cant just conjure dynamic world-beating industries out of thin air.

Technological innovation combined with a global pandemic has transformed the way in which employers and employees interact forever. The Covid- lockdown plunged almost half of all British workers into remote working ndash which looks to be their reality for the foreseeable future.Though a begrudged necessity for many during the ongoing pandemic, the benefits of remote working to both employees and employers have long been recognised. A  Stanford University study found that remote working boosted productivity by  per cent. Research has also linked remote working to improved mental wellbeing, as well as a reduction in sick days and employee attrition.Hybrid working gives workers the power to decide how, when and where they work best. Whether you like being around others or work better alone whether you favour in-person meetings or remote video calls whether you enjoy routine or prefer flexibility in your daily schedule ndash hybrid working caters for all. In doing so, employees enjoy greater work-le balance, improved wellbeing, and ndash crucially for businesses ndash report increased productivity.Working solely from home can be an isolating experience, and many miss the collective buzz that comes from working together in a shared physical space. Some even miss the commute, which can act as an important bookend to the day and a way to compartmentalise work and home le. Thatrsquos where a hybrid working model comes in ndash a chance to blend remote and office working, and reap the benefits of both.Within this time of immense change lies an opportunity for employers to foster a hybrid work culture centred around wellbeing, and unlock greater levels of productivity, engagement and job satisfaction in the process. But thatrsquos not all the increase in hybrid working has also instigated a sht towards a model which prioritises productive output over the numbers of hours worked.For many years, our shared concept of work has been defined by the simple premise that the more hours you put in, the more you get done. But the rise of the knowledge economy, combined with rapid technological innovation, has made equating productivity with longer hours feel like a relic from a bygone era. With more and more employers now realising their employees can be as or even more productive working from home than at the office, the emphasis has shted from simply fulfilling contracted hours to measuring quantiable results.Trust and communication will be critical to supporting a hybrid working culture. Thankfully, the mass uptake of cloud-based s like Microsoft Teams has strengthened the ability of many teams to communicate and collaborate, regardless of their proximity to one another. The onus will be on managers to use these channels to foster motivation, trust and autonomy within their teams. In doing so, they can emphasise that results and achievements are what ultimately matter, not just attendance.In a post-pandemic world, many people would like toto the office mdash but not completely. Once the health risk decreases and solutions to creating Covid-secure workplaces become more prevalent, we will see the true power of hybrid working in action. By embracing flexibility, autonomy and trust, employers can foster happier, healthier workforces mdash and boost productivity in the process.

With UK-EU trade deal talks going nowhere, what about the producers of Sunday morning politics shows The Sunday papers could at least look back on a week of negotiations. According to one account, the highs and lows were reflected in the catering. When fancy pizzas were replaced by what one observer called ldquomanky sandwiches, old hands knew there was trouble afoot.So to the Sunday shows. How could they say something new about a trade deal when there was nothing new to say : Minister wont rule out lockdown continuing for someTo make matters worse, the Minister for the Sunday shows was George Eustice, the Environment Secretary. The MP for Camborne and Redruth was a public relations man in a former le, which means he can be an Olympic standard wafflerthe occasiondemands.An early example of this happened on Sky Newsrsquo Ridge on Sunday when Mr Eustice said: ldquoWe will continue to work on negotiations until there is no point in continuing.As it turned out, the Brexiteer and former UKIP-er, was fairly well up on his tarfs and customs declaration chat. He needed to be because Marr had been phoning round, taking the temperature of businesses who would be affected by no deal.Presenter and Minister batted figures and quotes back and forth, with Marr hoping for an Andy Murray-like killer smash. It did not come.ldquoEvery time I give you evidence of people who are on the front line running businesses or federations, and they say it is not going to be okay, wersquore really worried, you simply say itrsquos going to be okay, said Marr.The Scot tried another tack, a quickfire quiz beginning with the question, ldquoJanuary  ndash can I take my dog on holiday with me to France Quick as a whippet, the Minister said yes. But there was a but. The UK was likely to be listed in the EUrsquos ldquoannexe two, which meant that whereas in the past the Marr chien would have travelled on a pet passport, now he she would need a certicate from the vet.ldquoHow much more dficult is that going to be  barked Marr, sounding like a dog with a bone.It would involve a trip to the vet conceded the Minister.: Iain Macwhirter on BiFab woesldquoYou need to send blood samples to the vet  days before, countered Marr. Goodness, the Marr clan was pretty keen on this holiday.Ah, thatrsquosyou are on \"the third list\", said Mr Eustice.Second list, third list. As Marr said, it was all quite complicated and going to cause a lot of problems for a lot of people. Brexit summed up in one.The Minister fared less well against Sophy Ridge. Getting nothing substantial on the trade talks, the presenter turned to the vaccine. How many doses were arriving in the UK this week Mr Eustice did not have an answer, but he was sure thatshe asked a Health Minister they would know.It would have been ldquohelpful, Ridge fired back,Mr Eustice had spoken to the relevant minister before coming on the programme. Ouch.Both Marr and Ridge wanted to knowthe last minute dashes to Brussels and talks of time running out were political theatre, there for effect, or cold hard reality. They had a point. There have been make or break moments than there are EU member states. How would we know this was ldquoit, the big one Katya Adler, the BBCrsquos Europe editor, assured Marr the media was on the case. ldquoWersquove all got our Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple outfits on, at least hypothetically. What a relief she added that last bit, evenreporters dressed as Agatha Christie characters would liven up bulletins no end.With an EU leadersrsquo meeting due on Thursday, it did seem as though time was genuinely running out for a deal.: Needy youngsters missing out \"I think we probably are now in the final few days in terms of deciding whether there can be an agreement, Mr Eustice told Marr.\"Of course,the ambience warms up again and actually great progress is made and it is just about sorting out the detail, then you can always find more time, you can always extend.\"But I think unless we can resolve these quite fundamental ergences at the moment then we are going to have to take a position in the next few days.\"Earlier, Marr had spoken to Andrew Lloyd Webber. The composer took part in the Oxford vaccine trials and had his jab in June.He was full of the joys of what might be happening come next Spring. For a start he could see his new musical, Cinderella, opening in May. Wasnrsquot that too soon, wondered Marr.ldquoAs they say in South Pacic, said Lloyd Webber, ldquoIrsquom a cockeyed optimist.There are not many of them to the pound or Euro when it comes to the EU-UK trade talks."},{"url":null,"title":"Wood smoke  wet dog  leaf mould  sniffing out the essence of home  Country Life with Rosemary Goring","story":"Recently a scientic initiative was announced that made my nose twitch.

It has raised hopes for the introduction of a range of new procedures to make accessing treatment easier and faster ndash helping to avoid horric stories of people drting up to  years before they receive help.One of the clinicians involved,Dr Stephen Anderson, says it is an ldquoamazing opportunity to reflectupon current services and make recommendations for improvements.He added: ldquoI have lots of hopes for change from the review.ldquoOne really important issue is education and training so that eating disorders are detected early and people referred for appropriate treatment as soon as possible.ldquoWe know from experience and very clearly from what people have told us, that services need to work better together ndash with better communication and pathways of care.Katie recalls struggling for about two years, hiding her severe weight loss from her family until it became obvious something drastic was wrong.ldquoI think it started when I was about , I just knew something was wrong, she says. ldquoI knew I wasnrsquot eating as much, but I didnrsquot speak to anyone about it and it wasnrsquot something we were told about at school.ldquoIt got worse and worse. There were changes in my behaviour, but my mum and dad thought my anxiety was because I was struggling to integrate into high school. Instead, it was anxiety around myself that translated to an eating disorder.Her changing shape was easily hidden beneath baggy clothes.ldquoItrsquos a very sneaky illness. It made me a very secretive person. I didnrsquot know what was going on with me.ldquoLooking back it was horric it was one of the most horrible experiences.There are about . million people in the UK with an eating disorder, however, itrsquos thought the true number is probably higher. Worryingly,  per cent donrsquot seek help, despite evidence that getting support means they are nine times more likely to recover.And although eating disorders are generally thought of as a female problem, one in three people affected is male ndash earlier this year cricket star Freddie Flintoff opened up about his -year struggle with bulimia, while actor Christopher Ecclestone has also spoken of his anorexia battle.According to Emma Broadhurst, National Officer of BEAT Scotland, pictured inset below, the pandemic has provided a perfect storm for people struggling with an eating disorder.ldquoWe knew in March we would see an increase in people coming to us because they were not accessing their usual support in the usual way.ldquoEating disorders thrive on isolation, she adds. ldquoThey are sneaky, private illnesses andyou are isolating, by yourself, not going to work or not socialising in the same way you normally would, then eating disorders will thrive on this.ldquoBefore the pandemic, these cases might not have come to fruition in the same way. Now itrsquos coming out.With Christmas around the corner she warns there are particular challenges ahead for anyone with an eating disorder and their loved ones.ldquoThe routine is out of the window and all the focus is on food. We want people to know they have support, she said.ldquoAs a parent you feel powerless because you want to make them better, and you canrsquot. you feel powerless and very alone.It breaks your heart.If Christmas bringsan excess of food, lockdown brought its own troubling triggers for people with eating disorders, according to Mr Anderson, who is leading the review with Dr Jacinta Tan, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who led a similar review in Wales, and Charlotte Oakley, of Connect Eating Service in Glasgow.ldquoThere were issues at the start of lockdown with people bulk buying and we know lots of people with eating disorders said they could no longer get their usual, or safe foods, which was extremely anxiety provoking, he says.ldquoGyms and other places for exercise were closed and this caused huge anxiety for a number of people.ldquoThere have also been big changesin how services operate.Since the reviewrsquos launch in March, workshops have been held with people experienced in living with an eating disorder, with plans for further meetings with clinicians and representatives from paediatrics, community mental health teams, liaison psychiatry and paediatric dentistry.It is also expected to involve Scotlandrsquos medical colleges, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Physicians, and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Health boards and social care partnerships are also set to be consulted.Itrsquos hoped the review will lead to earlier access to treatment and better training for medical professionals.ldquoSometimes when people ask for help with an eating disorder, they are told that their weight and blood tests are satisfactory, so are told that nothing is wrong, adds Dr Anderson.ldquoWe know doctors get on average two hours of teaching on eating disorders the whole way through medical schooland postgraduate training. There is a similar lack of education and training for nurses and psychologists,adds Mr Anderson.ldquoIt is such an amazing opportunity that we have to review the current set up of services across all sectors and across the country, and then make recommendations about how we can improve services across the wholeof Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11295582.jpg?type=article-full","title":"mike-ashley-makes-11th-hour-bid-save-debenhams","story":"His Frasers Group has confirmed it is is working on a deal that could rescue the familiar High Street name and provide hope for , employees.Debenhams was in the process of liquidation after JD Sports dropped out of sale talks last week.The chain which has stores across Scotland has been in adminstration since April and was put up for sale.It is due to shut all its stores by the end of next March, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business.Mr Ashley, a former Rangers FC shareholder and kingpin before South Africa-b based businessman Dave King siezed control in , has already bought other struggling High Street businesses and used to be a major shareholder in Debenhams.But Frasers said there was \"no certainty\" it could save the chain.The Frasers Group - which owns Sports Direct, Jack Wills, Evans Cycles and rival department store chain House of Fraser ndash said one of the biggest issues, was the collapse into administration last week of another High Street giant, Arcadia, which is the biggest concession holder in Debenhams department stores.\"There is no certainty that any transaction will take place, particularlydiscussions cannot be concluded swtly,\" the group said.It said while it \"hopes that a rescue package can be put in place and jobs saved, time is short and the position is further complicated by the recent administration of the Arcadia Group\".Mr Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United, has made no secret of his desire to acquire Debenhams in the past.He built up a % stake in the chain, but saw his poundm holding wiped out last year when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders, a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint.The deal could also see Frasers Group operate Debenhamsrsquo  stores under -month licences.Frasers Group was previously among the names in the frame during the bidding war for Debenhams.Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April.But the offer, thought to be in the region of poundm, was rejected as too low, leaving JD Sports to enter exclusive talks.Liquidators have already moved in to Debenhams stores to start clearing stock.It is understood Mr Ashley was only interested in taking on about  stores out of ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-writing-surely-wall-present-direction-uks-energy-provision","story":"Irrespective of what is said in the imminent Government White Paper, the writing is clearly on the wall for the present direction of the UKrsquos energy provision.All bar one of our existing seven nuclear power stations which provide essential rotational inertia that protects frequency during grid disturbances will be shut by , losing us around  per cent of our baseload power capacity.

From the northern isles’ perspective, we see it rather dferently. The pandemic has shown us what is possible for other people because so many people in my constituency are left bumping along on speeds that are less than  megabits per second.“I joined the st century just a couple of weeks ago, when I bought myself an iPhone , which has G capability. I speed tested it as I was coming up for the debate today. I got a speed test of  megabits per second download and  megabits per second upload. We have spoken for years about a digital ide, but that ide is now a chasm.“For Orkney and Shetland, the idea that internet speeds and access to the internet should be more than  times greater in SW than in KW,  and , and ZE,  and  illustrates the nature of the problem we face. It speaks eloquently about the failure. Simply leaving it to the private sector is what has produced the situation today.“My hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross [Jamie Stone] asked “Who is responsible for this ” We have this constantly in Scotland: on the one hand, there is the provision made by the Scottish Government and, on the other, we have schemes funded by the UK Government. The dficulty is that neither of them gives us what we need.“This House legislated for a universal service in broadband. Constituents of mine get quotes from BT for that and they hear of £,, £, or £, for a broadband connection to get them to  megabits per second. If that is only available to people who have a spare £,, £, or £, lying around the house, it is hardly a universal service.“However, my constituents are also frustrated at the lack of certainty and community consultation we see from the R scheme of the Scottish Government. We still do not know what they are going to deliver and when we are going to get it. All the signs are that the problems that we have had—a service to be deployed in the isles that is designed in Edinburgh what people in Edinburgh think we can get and we need—are going to be there again. The most remote and the most economically fragile communities in my constituency still risk being left behind.“It should not be rocket science.

Those who have worked tirelessly to make it a reality so quickly, including volunteers for the testing programme, deserve our profound gratitude. “However, attentions must now turn to the practicalities of distributing the vaccine to all corners of the country in what will surely be one of the largest public health exercises in history. It is vital that our islands are not left behind and that appropriate steps are taken to guarantee equal access to the vaccine.“The Pfizer vaccine requires freezer storage and that presents practical dficulties in our island and rural communities.  I was therefore pleased that the Health Secretary was able to give me a categoric assurance that freezer storage will indeed be available in the islands and that priority groups in Orkney will form part of the initial roll out.“Further details about how this process will work in practice, including how any subsequent vaccines might be incorporated in the programme, are obviously needed. However, I welcome this good news and encourage anyone in Orkney eligible for the vaccine to take up this opportunity.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Another would involve a change to soft drink sales.She added: “We have a drinks chiller at the front but were looking at introducing a bar restaurant-style system where fizzy drinks come from mixer taps.“If we could get something like that, we would be saving not just on bottles but also the water used for these which is transported around the country and is another waste.“That is quite a big investment, though, so I wouldn’t be able to consider that without a grant.”Zero Waste Scotland has said it will administer a total of £, in grant funding provided by the Scottish Government and European Regional Development Fund to empower island shops to take the next steps in the war on waste by ditching single-use packaging and moving to reusable options.It says that the new scheme would see cash made available to existing small and medium-sized enterprises in the isles to make the transition to package free dispensers.“My shop is so small, it is not just about fitting in the new stuff but also about moving everything  around so I don’t lose the things that I sell which enables me to pay staff and support the local community,” she said.“We have tried to do what we can within our budget. We do glass milk bottles for people, we have dispensing units for refills for washing up liquid and laundry liquid.“There are things that I have looked at that we can do, and sothey had just given us that money I applied for then I would have been really happy!”The scheme opened on th October, but Nancy stressed that wasn’t a great deal of time for small business owners like her.“It sounds like a lot of time but when you are running a shop it isn’t very long. We had to get three dferent quotes for some of these things,” she said.“I’m in the shop five and a half days a week — and my afternoons off have been spent on the phone and the internet scoping out possible projects. I don’t really have the extra time it takes to do it.”She added: “If I can’t come out with a scheme then we don#t get anything is my understanding at the moment.“I know it is worth putting a bit of effort in, though, becauseit does work I can really make a dference to the shop and the environment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/kate-forbes.jpg","title":"summit on future of gaelic as a community","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe summit on Tuesday st December, pm, will be co-chaired by Kate Forbes, constituency MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch.

There are still plenty of people in Skye and Raasay with Gaelic, and it can still be heard throughout the island.“Urgent work is required to save Gaelic, but as a living language it won’t be politicians, bureaucracy or tokenistic gestures that make the dference. Ultimately, it will be those people for whom it is the language of daily le that can reverse the decline.“I hope this summit will be a fruitful exercise in doing that.”Councillor Munro said: “It’s extremely important that Gaelic communities in Skye and Raasay have an opportunity to have their voices heard. The recent research by Soillse clearly sets out the challenges facing Gaelic in terms of usage and transmission.“Now is the time to consult with communities and to set the agenda for language policy and planning efforts. This online meeting is the first important step in taking this agenda forward.”As well as the community meetings, there is also the option to submit written evidence."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/STRATHPRINT-1.jpg","title":"strath print grateful for support in trying","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIt is not too late to order Christmas cards from Strath Print in Broadford.“You may be pleasantly surprised at how cost-effective it is to have cards made from your own photographs,” said co-founder and director Peter Dunlop.Founded in , Strath Print’s specialities are graphic design and printing on paper.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year.. The group are inviting people to give feedback by th Decemberpossible."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CLLR-JOHN-GORDON-STORR-1.jpg","title":"making the case for targeted investment in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineConsulting community planning partners on the specic projects that should be included in the plan started last week, and the members of the Eilean a’ Cheo ward were keen to hear the views of voters in the next stage in the process due to take place in January. As well as the council, the plan involves Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Futures Trust.All three agencies will help identy funding, once the list of projects has been agreed under five broad headings: Strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy.This week, following an online area committee meeting, Skye and Raasay councillors welcomed the progress to date .Tourism body SkyeConnect also welcomed the potential for the plan to deliver material benefits for the island.A spokesman added: “The priorities for SkyeConnect are, unsurprisingly, additional toilet facilities, road improvements, car parking and a greater provision of ’stop-over’ locations for campervans with appropriate basic infrastructure. In addition, SkyeConnect is working with a number of bodies to develop a so-called ‘internet of things’ which will greatly assist in managing the flow of visitors around the island.”The ‘internet of things’ concept sees digital infrastructure providing real time information on traffic flow and footfall at key locations. This can then be used to send mobile alerts to visitors with suggestions for alternative sites that are not too busy.John Gordonwas pleased the plan was “progressing well” as it had been a priority for Skye and Raasay councillors for some time. He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3511592.jpg--.jpg?1606925686000\n","title":"relaxation of sunday trading restrictions","story":"Retailers will be permitted to open earlier on Sunday  and Sunday  December.Mid and East Antrim Borough Council says the move will to support the local business community when the current Northern Ireland circuit breaker restrictions come to an end.It is hoped the additional shopping time will help with social distancing concerns and protect the community during these dficult times.A temporary relaxation of enforcement action against large food shops which choose to open earlier – ie from am to pm - on a Sunday to facilitate shopping for essential items for keyworkers, health care workers and vulnerable people including those with disabilities, in the lead up to Christmas, has also been agreed by Council.The same temporary relaxation will apply to all retailers for Sunday  December and Sunday  December, enabling these businesses to open from am.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Peter Johnston, welcomed the announcement.“This will help our businesses to make up some lost time coming up to Christmas and it should also assist with social distancing in our town centres on a busy Sunday”, the Mayor continued.“These arrangements are temporary and Council will keep them under continual review.

Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable.

Joseph Carter, head of the charity, said: During the first lockdown the shielding scheme offered vital support to some of the most clinically vulnerable people in our communities. This support, which ranged from guaranteed food delivery slots to exemptions from work, proved essential in keeping people safe and well. As we approach winter, these vulnerable people now must not only contend with the traditional winter concerns - but also concerns about coronavirus too. We cannot allow people to become cut off and isolated during these bleak winter months, Mr Carter said.Bernie Divin, who lives in Londonderry and suffers from severe eosinophilic asthma, works in a hospital and was initially told to shield at the start of lockdown in March.She later ed to work and supports theof shielding, particularly over the winter and until a vaccine is widely available. Ms Divin said: Shielding was an invaluable leline for people like me. I hope the Executive will look to restore shielding, and the support that comes with it, until mass vaccination is possible.

If you got victims groups involved earlier on, that shuts one door. If you go down with politicians, another door shuts . However, the NIO has denied the talks were secret.An NIO spokesperson said: The UK Government is listening to people from all communities, victims and survivors regarding legacy issues, and is committed with our Irish partners to seek a way forward for everyone. We are not engaged in #secret talks# with anyone.Victims campaigner Kenny Donaldson, who represents Innocent Victims United, said: Over the last couple of weeks a number of iniduals who were part of that room have had cause to engage with me and with the organisation on a range of issues...and the process that came here to fore. Because this is not a one off meeting. Meetings off this nature have been going on since February. Not a word of any of this was said by those iniduals. So it was intended to be kept extremely quiet. The Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has not confirmedhe was aware of the talks. UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt, a former victims# commissioner, speaking to the Nolan Show, said: Victims keep hearing people talking about processes that will be victim-centred and that expression is often honoured in the breach. Here is an example of a process that is not victim-centred because they are not even invited into the room. The Sunday Le reports that the talks are also expected to recommend millions of pounds of funding for their armsbodies. Central to the discussions were how to deal with legacy issues and financial support for projects in loyalist and republican areas that have the backing of paramilitaries.This, they argue, will help them move from criminality into established community roles. The money will come from the government’s £million Fresh Start package to end paramilitarism.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumSecret legacy talks a #kick in the teeth# for victimsA victims# campaigner has branded secret legacy talks in London a kick in the teeth for all who lost loved ones during the Troubles.NewsSecret peace talks will lead to cash bonanza for terror groupsSecret peace talks between government officials and loyalist and republicans are expected to recommend millions of pounds of funding for their armsbodies.Most ReadSpy-cam Northern Ireland doctor#s le flushed down toilet after losing career and marriageEx-UVF bomber caught putting on condom in Belfast Caffe NeroSt John the bomber: Grinning New IRA killer in guise he used to target prison officer Adrian IsmayDUP man flags up gaffe in Spiderman game‘Let the adventures begin’ – John McAreavey and his we Tara announce birth of baby boyLatest NewsParticipants of secret legacy talks told to keep meeting confidential, whistleblower claimsAghalee couple#s dazzling Christmas light show has cops worried with folk flocking to charity displayCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Survey shows majority in favour of vaccine Four boys chased and assaulted by  teenagers in Belfast hate crimeFirst same-sex couple to marry in Northern Ireland hail ‘wonderful day’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I would say he is very gloomy, and obviously very cautious about the ability to make progress today.“There was news last night on some media sources that there was a breakthrough on fishing. That is absolutely not the case from what we’re hearing this morning.”Mr Coveney said there was “no progress made” on Sunday and that the negotiations “seem stalled” with barriers to progress “very much in place”.But he added: “There is still time. Lunchtime seems a long way away now, given the intensity of these discussions, but that’s where we are, and anyone who is briefing that there are breakthroughs in either of these two big areas … I don’t think is accurate.”An EU official told the Associated Press that the outcome remains “uncertain” and can “still go both ways”.But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly insisted a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU is “nearly there” although negotiators may not be successful in time.He told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “The vast majority of the elements of this agreement have been resolved and we’re now hanging on a small number of important areas where we don’t have agreement.“We’re nearly there but we are not quite there yet. And it may well be that we will not be able to resolve this in the timescale we’ve got, but we’re nearly there.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen will assess later whether a deal can be salvaged.The two leaders will speak at pm on Monday, their second call in a little over  hours, after their top negotiators spent Sunday locked in detailed talks.Lord Frost and Mr Barnier were ordered back to the negotiating table in a final push to seethey could break the stalemate – with just over three weeks until the end of the transition period.In the febrile mood surrounding the negotiation, British sources denied reports on Sunday that there had been a breakthrough on the thorny issue of future fishing rights.Reports suggested they had agreed to a transition period for phasing in changes for access for EU boats to UK waters of between five and seven years.🇪🇺🇬🇧 Decisive hours for the future of EU-UK relations: EU Chief negotiator @MichelBarnier has started to brief EU Ambassadors about the current state of play of #Brexit negotiations. #COREPER pic KOtpImINL— Sebastian FischerDecember , However, a UK Government source said: “There’s been no breakthrough on fish.

GBPUSD slipped from . overnight to . in early trade, a chunky move to start the session and reflective of both the pound’s sensitivity to headlines and the severe downside risks from a no-deal Brexit.”Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove will meet his counterpart on the UK-EU joint committee in Brussels on Monday, the UK Government said.A spokesman said: “The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will meet vice presidentSefcovic today in Brussels to discuss issues related to their work as co-chairs of the Withdrawal Agreement joint committee.“The Withdrawal Agreement joint committee oversees UK and EU implementation, application and interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Northern Ireland Protocol.“The work of the joint committee is separate from the ongoing FTA negotiations.”Following their earlier call on Saturday, Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen acknowledged that there are still “serious dferences” to be resolved on fisheries and the mechanism for resolving disputes as well as competition rules.While the two sides have been circling round the same issues for months, it is unclear whether the intervention of the leaders has created the political space for the negotiators finally to bridge the gap.What is agreed is that time is rapidly running out.If there is no deal by the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of the month, then Britain will leave the single market and the customs union and begin trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms, with the imposition of tarfs and quotas.Before then it has to be ratied by both Houses of Parliament in the UK and the European Parliament as well as signed off by the EU leaders.There had been hopes that could happen at a two-day summit in the Belgian capital starting on Thursday – their final scheduled gathering of the year – but the timetable is looking increasingly tight.France has publicly warned that it will veto any dealit is unhappy with the terms, amid signs President Emmanuel Macron is anxious that Mr Barnier is preparing to give too much ground in his determination to get a deal.PAMost ReadSpy-cam Northern Ireland doctor#s le flushed down toilet after losing career and marriageEx-UVF bomber caught putting on condom in Belfast Caffe NeroSt John the bomber: Grinning New IRA killer in guise he used to target prison officer Adrian IsmayDUP man flags up gaffe in Spiderman game‘Let the adventures begin’ – John McAreavey and his we Tara announce birth of baby boyLatest NewsHaemophiliac children treated with ‘more reliable’ commercial blood productsShadow minister quits after saying registrars have right to object gay marriageIn Pictures: William and Kate begin morale-boosting trip on royal trainJailed terrorist admits involvement in Manchester Arena bombing for first timeWilliam and Kate meet frontline ambulance workers in Edinburgh,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Annemarie Bell’s father, Hugh, died suddenly while showing a worker from The Resource Centre his famous Christmas garden on December , . He was  years of age at the time and had experienced a tough year with infections but remained fit. Hugh loved to decorate the family home at Moyola Walk in Shantallow at Christmas time where there was a ‘real sense of community’. He became known for his impressive festive displays and was hailed as the ‘King of Christmas’. googletag.cmd.push  Just prior to his death, Hugh taught daughter Annemarie how to wire the plugs but, she says, ‘little did I know, I would have to do it again so quickly’. He was well-known in the local community for his walks to Knock and charitable work with the Foyle Hospice, and also helped to organise the first Derry marathons. Annemarie said: “My daddy has been the king of Christmas from I can remember. “When we were young my mother and father smoked and they wrapped fag packets up with wrapping paper and hung them up on the tree. “That’s the tradition that I grew up with and shoe boxes at the bottom of the tree for fake presents. googletag.cmd.push “Our crib was always the centre piece of our home and the main focus of our celebrations.” When the family moved to Mount Vernon in Culmore, Hugh became even more invested in the Christmas season, lighting up hedges and setting up inflatable reindeers in the garden. “I’ve just followed suit now and added new features the past two years,” Annemarie explained. As a youth worker in Pennyburn she erected the Christmas tree as soon as Halloween ended. The spiritual side of Christmas is of most import to the family and as such they would have attended a Christmas nativity event at Thornhill.     The year Hugh died they had around  nativities but Annemarie continued gathering and now has  around the house. A nativity picture is the oldest item in the family’s collection. Sadly, some decorations have been consigned to the past, Annemarie explained: “We had this big inflatable snowman and it was really, really strange. “A big fat giant snowman, we must’ve had it for at least  years and my daddy died on the th and that just went kaput on the st. So, it was strange, it was probably one of his first.” This year, Annemarie says, many people have experienced hardship in the city with a further announcement this week of job cuts. She believes it is important for everyone to get back to basics and think about family and the true meaning of Christmas.  With the pandemic it felt strange for children to be locked indoors all day long. Annemarie reflected: “I think this Christmas is going to be more special for people, we’re more used to living with one another during the pandemic, and young people won’t be looking to run here, there and everywhere. “I’d imagine this year will be more traditional, that family board games will come back. “And people won’t want their children going to other houses. “When you look at the row of houses lit up in Shantallow right now, that is community. “I was driving around after work last night and you see houses lit up that weren’t before and you think to yourself, isn’t that so beautul, so much hope and joy in the community. “For me, that’s why my daddy wanted to do it, to spread some joy.” She added: “The wains are at school at the minute but the binmen were shouting to me, ‘your garden is class, I’m so glad you followed on in your daddy’s footsteps!’ “Those kind of comments from someone out doing his job, that’s what it’s all about.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted a picture of the paintings after he visited the school last week, and the portraits quickly went viral, appearing on BBCs The View programme. Titillated Executive ministers praised the childrens artwork on social media, with Justice Minister Naomi Long adopting the painting as her Twitter profile picture. The Alliance MLA felt the work captured her essence perfectly. “I love my wonky eyebrow! It looks like Im a bit cross about something which I usually am! Fantastic work and say thanks to all the young artists!” she said. googletag.cmd.push Finance Minister, Sinn Feacuteins Conor Murphy, took time to write to the pupils and express his gratitute, saying the painting was an improvement on the real thing. Mr Murphy also told the children that one of their local heroes had held pride of place in Stormont for years. “The late Martin McGuinness, who was Deputy First Minister, had in his office a large photograph behind his desk in Stormont Castle of someone who attended your school,” he wrote. “It was of the  All-Ireland winning captain, Henry Downey. In an office which had photographs of world leaders including Nelson Mandela, the photo of Henry Downey of Lavey had pride of place.” googletag.cmd.push After the paintings were beamed around the airwaves, requests began to make their way to South Derry and the children have been busy. The Blame Games Tim McGarry, Jake OKane and Colin Murphy got the full treatment from the Mayogall Monets, along with local councillor Sean McPeake, who helped arrange the visit. Principal Mary OKane said the paintings, and associated publicity, had created a great feeling of positivity around the school. “Its created a great buzz, which is very important at this time,” she said. “Following lockdown and the long period of absence from school, its important that children get a wee boost now.     “Its important for the whole school, but particularly those children who are getting a real buzz out of it at the moment. They see themselves as being pretty famous artists.”  Another famous local artist, Kilreas Conor Larkin, agreed to give the childrens paintings a professional artists scrutiny for us this week – and he was very impressed!  Aoe and Charley Arlene Foster: The artist has captured Arlenes ‘lockdown cofure’ – a large, thick plumage of black hair. Arlene is looking away from the viewer, maybe deep in thought or dreaming of an easier time. They have captured a fantastically sombre and meditative state that many artists strive for!  Lisa and Maria Michelle O’Neill: The subject has been caught in a moment of contemplation or reflection. She appears to be gazing just below the viewer’s eye-line. Thinking hard and remaining very tight-lipped, giving no clue to her inner-thoughts. Her hands are clasped, asplaying her cards close to her chest.  Isabelle, Christopher and Charlie Naomi Long: The artist has gone for a bold palette of contrasting colours. The subject is looking a little bewildered or deflated. She appears to have one hand behind her back, asnot wanting to show the viewer her crossed fingers. Or have we purposely been left wonderingNaomi’s hands are tied   Ella, Shannon and Dara Nichola Mallon: The subject appears very happy or comfortable in her own skin. She stands up straight with her hands by her side, portraying a certain pride. This could be the Mona Lisa of political portraits, with her confident gaze following the viewer around the room.  Serena and Chloe Caraacutel Niacute Chuiliacuten: Simple and effective brush strokes have been used to capture the subject’s vibrant hair and expressionless face. The subject stares directly from the canvas, almost straight through the viewer. The artist has done well to capture this moment of determination.  Anna, Riacutean and Molly Conor Murphy: The artist has captured this subject well, leaving the viewer wondering ‘what has he just been asked ’. His bottom lip juts out in a moment of deep concentration, staring past the viewer in search of an answer, as the viewer begs to know what exactly the question is.   Emily Rose and Isla Diane Dodds: A subtle palette of greys has been used to portray the subject’s face, perhaps an indication as to how she is feeling. The subject appears to be smiling, but also looks panicked as she scans her surroundings.  Charley, Don and Seamus Oacuteg Peter Weir: This subject is portrayed as being happy and almost laughing, leaving the viewer asking ‘what is so funny ’. But, looking behind the glasses and gazing further into his eyes, the viewer soon realises there is no joke here.  Amber and Riacuteonach Robin Swann: The artist has really taken the time to depict someone under extreme pressure. His fists are clenched tight, his mouth opened wide asshouting for someone to listen. But, his eyes look sad and his cheeks tear-stained. His gaze is directed straight at you, asto say ‘I have more bad news.  Johnny, Callum, Cathal and Conan Edwin Poots: This painting shows someone who appears to be very happy with themselves, but look deeper into the subjects eyes and you can see that one eye is looking hard at the viewer for approval and the other is looking back at himself in some doubt.  Sean, Conor and Donnacha Sean McPeake :The Artist has captured the subject wide eyed, maybe in disbelief. The pale hue used for his lips, blend into his skin tone – perhaps the artist is sending the subliminal message that the subject is lost for words. The silvery grey hair gives the subject a ‘worldly wise’ appeal.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In my view, the little magician was the greatest footballer the world has ever had the pleasure of watching. Its as simple as that. But, he was more than a footballer. He was an icon and it was fitting when the worlds greatest ever team, the New Zealand All-Blacks, recognised that. They carried out a black number ten jersey with his name emblazoned on it before last weekends meeting of the nations. Its just a pity Peter Shilton, a world-class goalkeeper in his own right, didnt have the same class. Yes, Maradona cheated with his hand of God goal against the England stopper. Some might say honesty is the best policy, but there is a time and a place to twist the dagger. And last week wasnt that time. googletag.cmd.push He may have had his problems off the pitch, but sporting stars should always be judged for what they do in the colosseums in which they perform. Maradona wasnt born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Of the nine mouths that needed fed in their home in the Villa Fiorito area of Buenos Aires, his father was the only earner, allowing his family to focus on study. It was Diegos ability to control the ball like it was an extension of his body that alerted the scouts of the local Argentinos Juniors. And so the roller-coaster was taking off. He bagged goal after goal and soon he was in the blue and gold of Boca Juniors. In their La Bombonera stadium, which shook with sheer atmosphere on game day, he led them to the Primera Divisioacuten. But, after just  games he was off to Europe as Barcelona came calling. googletag.cmd.push The fact that he moved to one of the Catalan giants, who were Mes Que Un Clubwas one thing. What defined him for me, was how he carried the national team. That wonder goal against England in  was a letime in the making. If you watch footage from his time at Napoli, that was the perfect grounding. Diego dragged an unfancied horse to two league titles, Italian and UEFA Cups, he was kicked black and blue. As he was in that  clash with England. Like the streets of Buenos Aires, Naples was the school of hard knocks. He literally had to dance his way around potential leg-breaking tackles and making a mockery of England was a by-product of it all.     Maradona is just one of those players that youd love to watch in the flesh. The viral video on social media of him juggling the ball is part of his legacy. He was just at one with the ball...oozing class. I remember trying to watch the  World Cup Final from a distance in the Bushtown Hotel. On the way home from the Port, we called in for grub. I pleaded to get away from the table. By that stage, the Germans had levelled the game at -. Maradona huffed and puffed all during the game, but he made the crucial play. His through ball played in Jorge Luis Burruchagafor the winner. Its that type of instinct that separates the good from the great. And the thing about it, much of that craft is self-taught away from the training field. I was chatting to Dermot Heaney during the week, for a feature in next weeks paper. His ball-winning ability was honed from endless hours kicking the ball against a gable wall. Unbelievable – like legend - is an overused word. It should only be used for occasions like last Sunday to describe Joe Cannings four sideline cuts over the bar. For all the great coaching hed had access to, Id say it was perfected on the family farm or at Portumna pitch. Eoin Bradleys goal in Derrys  qualier clash with Down. Owen Mulligans wonder goal against the Dubs the same year. All moments of magic. I remember chatting to a defender who had played against Glenullin one evening. How was he supposed to know what Skinner was going to do next, when the man didnt know himself. Thats the x-factor that makes all the dference. It was encouraging chatting to Damian Cassidy this week about the new proposals for Derrys coaching plan. In particular, it was the committees research around Go Games and making them five-a-side for the very young. Why  To promote decision-making and flair. Alleluia. This is what we have been missing. Back to the days of jumpers for goalposts and playing in the back field until either it got dark, or somebody huffed and went home with the ball. Once you realised that the big boys were going to kick you instead of the ball, it was time to figure out a wat to play around them. The great players learn on the job, away from regimented systems where they are forced to play with one hand tied behind your back. Thank God for Maradona. For those too young to remember him, the constant barrage of footage should inspire the next genius.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The pensioner fell in the Greenwalk area of Creggan on Friday evening. Local people and family members who came to her aid did not want to move her, so they tried to keep her warm and dry after calling for an ambulance. However, local independent councillor Gary Donnelly said it took two hours for ambulance to arrive. Cllr Donnelly described the scene as shocking. He added that residents in Greenwalk have been trying to get improved street lighting for years but without success. googletag.cmd.push The family of the local woman said she suffered a broken shoulder in the fall. After being contacted by the Derry News, a NIAS spokesperson apologised for how Fridays call-out had been handled. “We apologise for any distress or discomfort suffered as a result of her prolonged wait for an ambulance,” the spokesperson said. “NIAS seeks to provide the quickest possible response to meet the clinical needs of any patient who contacts us as a result of having suffered illness or injury. “However, regrettably some patients are currently waiting longer than we would wish due to the demand for our service and the impact of the Covid- pandemic on our staffing levels.” googletag.cmd.push The NIAS spokesperson said the call in relation to the Creggan incident was received at .pm on Friday. “Based on information passed to ambulance control, it was prioritised as a Category  call with a performance target of  minutes. “A crew did not arrive at this scene until : which was  minutes outside of the target response. “NIAS recognises the distress and discomfort a wait of over two hours for an ambulance is to an elderly patient who is lying in the cold and wet, or to those who are caring for her at that time. “The delay in this case was as a result of crews in the area responding to calls which were more pressing in terms of clinical need.     “NIAS regrets that the patient had to endure this delay and once again offers a sincere apology. “We would have liked to have provided a more immediate response, particular given the age of the patient and the conditions in which she had to wait.” The NIAS spokesperson said they receive more than  calls each day through the  system. “To enable us to target our resources to those whose clinical condition is most urgent, each call is triaged and categorised accordingly. “Against each of the categories is a performance target for response times which NIAS aims to deliver. “Category  calls are those calls which are immediately or potentially le-threatening and to which NIAS seeks to despatch an immediate response with an average performance target of  minutes.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fr Seamus OConnell told mourners at St Oliver Plunketts Church that the -year-old was a proud Greenlough man. “Brendy was quiet, good mannered, good looking and liked fun,” he said. “Brendy was born in Greenlough, baptised in Greenlough, went to school in Greenlough and played football with Greenlough boys. “Were celebrating the funeral mass of a Greenlough man, where he was well-respected and had fun.” Local GAA club, St Oliver Plunketts GAC, led the tributes paid to a sorely missed club man. googletag.cmd.push “Brendy as we all knew him liked nothing more than lining out for the wee reds on a Sunday afternoon and was a regular on the scoresheet for our reserve team too,” they said. “His passion and infectious smile will be sorely missed but never forgotten by all involved with Greenlough GAC. “We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the McNally and Downey family circles at this sad time.” The widespread nature of the tributes paid to Breandaacuten highlighted how many les he had touched throughout the world. Breandaacuten celebrating success with Wolfe Tones GAC, Melbourne. He spent time in both Australia and America, and local GAA clubs with whom he was involved posted messages of support for the family on social media. googletag.cmd.push St Pats Donegal GFC in Philadelphia said there was deep sadness within the community following news of his death. “It is with deep sadness that we learn of the passing of Breandaacuten McNally. Brendy had a great summer in Philadelphia in  and enjoyed some great times with the club,” they said. “We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and extended family and friends at this sad time.” Wolfe Tones GAC in Melbourne, where Breandaacuten starred for their football team in , also extended their condolences. “Everyone at Wolfe Tones has been saddened to learn of the passing of one of our former players, Breandaacuten McNally,” they said.     “Breandan played for the Wolfetones men’s team last year and was a huge part of the team and all their success throughout . “On behalf of everyone at Wolfe Tones GAC we would like to extend our deepest condolences to all of Breandans family and friends.” The McNally family business, B McNally  Sons Car Sales, are former sponsors of Watty Graham GAC, Glen, who also sympathised with the family. “Watty Grahams are saddened to learn of the untimely passing of Breandaacuten McNally, son of our former senior football team sponsor, Brendan,” they said. “Condolences to Brendan, Patricia, Ruairiacute, Aoe and the entire McNally family at this very sad time.” Everywhere he went, the young Greenlough man has touched lives, Fr OConnell told mourners at his funeral mass on Friday. After Breandaacuten travelled to America to receive treatment for his condition, he made such an impression on the hospital staff that they kept in touch. “The trip brought a host of new friends, real, caring people and was unbelievable the care that the family received and especially their son,” said Fr OConnell. “It was delightful, so delightful that the nurses and one of the surgeons kept in touch, so impressed were they by Brendy and his family, and his mother in particular.” Mourners heard how family was so important in Breandaacutens le. Fr OConnell also paid tribute to Breandaacutens familys devotion to him at his funeral mass last Friday, and described them as extraordinary. “All of them were in America at one time or another, supporting one another. Thats how the family became known. “As far as Im concerned, his family were pretty normal people. They did ordinary things and did them well, but truthfully, they had become extraordinary.” The night before his funeral, Breandaacutens sister Aoe appealed to friends and family to write down their memories of him along with any photos to be posted in a special memory box at the chapel. Fr OConnell ended his homily with a story that summed up the relationship between the McNally siblings. “Wed a concert one time in Greenlough. There were all kinds of people involved and Patsy was there with this wean on her knee,” he said. “Low and behold, when her brother appeared on stage, off she went like a scalded cat, leaving granny wondering where she was going. “Where did she go  She didnt settle until she got onto the stage and claimed her brother. Aoe was that wean. “She now claims him even more than ever. Family is important. Family is signicant,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The deferral by Causeway Coast and Glens Councils planning committee is to allow an alternative application to progress to the same stage so a decision can be made. The controversial proposal would see a single storey McDonalds restaurant with car parking and drive through facilities erected at a section of the existing Asda site alongside the towns Ring Road. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel, which backs onto the proposed site, have stated their objection to the application. After the initial application was deferred at Octobers Planning Committee meeting, a second application was lodged showing the location of the restaurant on the East side of the car park. googletag.cmd.push At a meeting of the Planning Committee, Causeway Coast and Glens councillors heard objections from a representative of the Lodge Hotel which is situated close to the proposed site. The spokesperson said noise and disturbance from the development would have an adverse impact on residents at the hotel and the knock-on effect could cause the hotel to go out of business. Representatives of the Lodge Hotel have raised objections to the proposal. The points were echoed by some councillors, with Alderman William Duddy citing anti-social behaviour arising from the existing McDonalds site in Coleraine. “Some residents have told me they can hear the revving and the music, and some of those are three quarters of a mile away,” said Alderman Duddy. googletag.cmd.push “We cannot leave the hotel out of this. Its  years in operation and is the only tourist asset we have in this town in regards to accommodation. “We have an obligation to secure and maintain that as a planning committee. The noise, the smell, the fumes, the litter and the strong likelihood of anti-social behaviour taking place in that car park. “The police have yet to be able to resolve the issues at Riverside, which has been ongoing for years. It is imperative to take into account the impact on those using the hotel.” The committee have voted to defer the current application until the alternative planning application reaches a stage where both can be reviewed at the same time.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One local councillor described the news as a Christmas present for Derry City and Strabane District Council. Details of the financial support secured were outlined during a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Planning committee on Tuesday. At the meeting, Alfie Dallas, the councils Lead Finance Officer, presented a report on the situation faced by the council in the first half of this financial year from April  to September . Mr Dallas said the councils planned budget for   was poundm, with % of that money coming from rates collected. googletag.cmd.push However, Mr Dallas said the councils finances had been very signicantly impacted by the Covid crisis. He said that the council had lost approximately pound.m during the first half of the financial year. These losses included: - pound.m as a result of the closure of council facilities, including leisure centres- pound, due to the closure of council-run car parks- pound, as a result of the loss of building control income- pound, loss of income from cemeteries due to non-charging during the pandemic Mr Dallas said the council had also faced huge unplanned costs as a result of having to respond to the pandemic. googletag.cmd.push These included health and safety costs, costs associated with new working arrangements, communications and IT costs to enable home-working. However, Mr Dallas said that thankfully the councils losses had been completely mitigated by the financial support received from a number of government departments. He said the council had recouped pound.m of its losses from the Job Retention Scheme Furlough. He said the Department of Finance had provided support of pound.m as part of a package for all  councils in Northern Ireland, while the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs had allocated pound, to the council for waste management losses. Mr Dallas said the government had also provided pound.m to cover the losses at City of Derry Airport which means that this financial burden will not fall on the council.     Government support has therefore been critical in ensuring Council finances have remained stable and has enabled signicant decisions around services to be avoided, said Mr Dallas. However, he added that there remained signicant risk and uncertainty over the councils finances because of its reliance on rates income for its annual budget. Speaking at Tuesdays meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper said that back in March April of this year, the situation had been scary in relation to the financial situation facing the council. Given the government support, he welcomed that the council could continue to look at major infrastructure projects that had been planned pre-Covid. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said given the doom and gloom earlier in the year, the news that the councils losses had been completely mitigated was like a Christmas present. This is an absolutely fantastic outcome, she said. SDLP councillor Martin Reilly paid tribute to the council officers for their efforts in recent months. It is such a good position to be in in comparison to where we thought we would be six months ago, said Cllr Reilly.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You enjoy playing and you take any opportunity you can get.ldquoI was nervous going into it but I probably had one of the best games I ever played. I was going out an expressing myself and I was named player of the match.However, her world came crashing down when she suffered an injury while playing for the NI U- team when what looked like a normal stress fracture in her foot was to keep her out of action for four years.ldquoIt should have healed naturally within eight to  weeks and I kept getting told it would heal with rest, she recalled.ldquoIt came to a year but it hadnrsquot healed fully, so I got a second opinion and the consultant said I should have had surgery straight away on it.ldquoI had the operation and went through the full rehab period, but I was still having quite a lot of issues, so I had a second surgery and it was back to square one.Caragh recalls ldquocrying day after day at the prospect of never playing football again and said every time she took a step forward ldquoit felt like five steps back again.She went on: I had thought about going to England or America when I left school, but being injured at that age there was no point trying to chase that.ldquoHaving a lot of success at a young age, I just didnrsquot know le without football.Caragh made herto action almost four years on from her injury and after a year with Glentoran she spent a season in Iceland with Fylkir.She says Reykjavik was an ldquoamazing place to play and live and after being introduced to CrossFit in her rehab, it was in Iceland her interest in the sport grew.ldquoI was totally hooked on it and progressed quite quickly in it. I started to do a few local competitions and for a while I was balancing the two.ldquoBecause I enjoyed CrossFit so much, my love for football waned slightly. I got to the point where I didnrsquot have the same desire as before.She ed to Glentoran after her year in Iceland, lting the Irish Cup with the east Belfast side and representing Northern Ireland before halting her time in the sport to focus on CrossFit.In her break from football, Caragh said her priorities changed away from the pitch when she married her husband, Michael, in .At the turn of  she was set to compete at high-level CrossFit competitions in Asia, Egypt and the Netherlands before the Covid- pandemic intervened.ldquoI hadnrsquot planned to come back to football. Gail Redmond at Glentoran heard the competitions were scrapped and saw it as an opportunity to get me back playing, she explained.ldquoInitially I was a bit hesitant but she said about the Glens challenging for the title. I think that pulled on my heart stings a bit.Caragh netted four goals in six Womenrsquos Premiership matches to set Glentoran on course for the title before an ldquounexpected call from NI manager Kenny Shiels saw her reintroduced to the international fold.ldquoKenny was watching out first game against Cltonville. After being away from football I donrsquot think he knew who I was but I got  minutes at the end and must have impressed him.Shiels invited Caragah to train with the senior squad and was named as a stand-by for Northern Irelandrsquos trip to the Faroe Islands in Septemberrsquos Euro  qualier.She was drafted into the squad when midfielder Marissa Callaghan pulled out and made her internationalas a second-half substitute in a - win.Despite her sensationalto the NI set-up, Hamiltonrsquos season was ended prematurely by a knee injury sustained days before the victory away to Belarus.She adds that while she is disappointed to be on the sidelines, she is thankful to both Glentoran and Shiels for their support to keep her involved in club and country as much as possible.She admits she is undecided whether she will focus on CrossFit orto the football pitch after her recovery.ldquoThatrsquos the million dollar question, she said. At the minute I am focusing on getting as fit as possible to make sure Irsquom able to do the best that I can in whatever I do.ldquoI want to be healthy and injury-free so I will make that decision closer to the time depending on how things are going.Going into last nightrsquos crunch tie, Northern Ireland were hoping to secure a play-off place in the European Championships for the first time.Despite her absence for the remainder of the campaign, Caragh says she has no doubts Northern Ireland can secure second position in Group C and make history.She credits manager Shiels with instilling a strong belief in his side. ldquoHe has brought out something that was always there but a lot of it is belief and confidence, she said.ldquoPreviously we would have played within ourselves to avoid defeat, but now there is an attitude that we can go and win this game.ldquoThere is a hunger and desire to push on. To think we are in with a possible play-off space in such a short space of time is incredible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Christmas.jpg","title":"Christmas cup finals  ","story":"NEWCASTLE League officials have put in place what they say is ldquoone final attempt to play last seasonrsquos Harry Clarke Cup and Bobby Dalzell Cup finals.The Harry Clarke Cup final between Celtic Bhoys and Ballynagross has been rescheduled for Ballyhornan on Tuesday, December , with a pm kick off.The Bobby Dalzell decider between Killough and Ballynahinch Olympic Town is to be played at the same venue the following day with a .pm kick off.Itrsquos the latest attempt by the Newcastle League to play the fixtures, which have been postponed on a number of occasions owing to the Covid- pandemic.The Bobby Dalzell final is traditionally played on Boxing Day, while the Harry Clarke final is usually held over the Easter period.League secretary Alan Craig said he hopes the finals can at last get go ahead.However, he warned that there will be no further reschedulingthe matches are unable to be played.He said: ldquoDiscussions have taken place with the clubs concerned and agreement has been reached that should we find ourselves in a further lockdown, or unable to play the finals on these dates due to further restrictions, then we are at a stage that the finals will not be rescheduled.ldquoWe as a league have tried our utmost to give the players an opportunity to be involved in a cup final, but there comes a time when we need to make a decision on the values of the cup.

The concerts are due to be broadcast on Sunday, December , and Tuesday, December .News of the concerts comes after festive lights were switched on in Downpatrick last weekend, with others due to be illuminated over the coming weeks at local towns and villages including Ballynahinch, Newcastle, Killyleagh, Saintfield, Crossgar, and Castlewellan.Both Downpatrick and Newcastle will have articial trees, with a cut tree erected in Ballynahinch with the local authority illuminating festive lights at up to  sustainable Christmas trees across the district as well as  so-called street trees.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said that Christmas  will be like no other.She said the local authority wants to acknowledge the impact that Covid- has had on so many peoplersquos lives and sharing a message of light and hope for better times ahead.ldquoWhile we couldnrsquot hold our traditional Christmas events and light switch-ons, we still wanted to come together as a district and I hope many will join us from their own homes to watch the upcoming light and hope concerts, she continued.ldquoI am delighted we have secured artists of such calibre and proud of the homegrown talent from Newry, Mourne and Down on display.Cllr Devlin said that as the Christmas lights are switched on across the district, she wants to acknowledge the particular dficulties faced by the retail sector this festive season.She added: ldquoFollowing the latest restrictions announced by the Northern Ireland Executive, our lsquomake it local Christmas campaign will now be launched at the safe and appropriate time.ldquoThe message from council is always to shop local and shop safely and this will be emphasised during the campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Down(1).jpg","title":"Down have title in sight  ","story":"ldquoWErsquoVE been knocking on the door for years now, and it is really exciting that we may finally do it.Those are the words of Down captain Karen McMullan ahead of Saturdayrsquos clash with Antrim in the All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship final at Breffni Park, Cavan.Down were beaten finalists two years ago, before making the semi-finals last year. Once more they have gone right to the business end of the competition, but this time they are determined to carry off the silverware.ldquoFrom a neutralrsquos point of view, it should be a really exciting match, the Castlewellan woman said. ldquoIt is also great for Ulster camogie that two northern teams are in the final.ldquoWersquove been so close over the last few years and it would be great to be able to get over that final hurdle now.With Down teams performing strongly at schools level in camogie for a while, it was always felt that would ultimately translate to success higher up the age groups. And so it has proven to be. McMullan says a number of factors have come together to allow Down to prosper, including manager Derek Dunnersquos influence.ldquoDerek has been brilliant for us, she said. He is passionate and committed to the team. In his preparation, he leaves no stone unturned. He has definitely gone above and beyond the call of duty for us.ldquoHe has brought the best people into the off-field team around us, and he has invested in us. When someone does that, it makes you want to repay their faith by bringing success. It is a time-consuming role for him too, he does a lot as well away from the matches and the training ground, so the fact we have made it to the final is brilliant for him too.In what has been a year when sportsmen and sportswomen have been left unsure about what would happened because of the coronavirus, Karen and her team-mates are revelling in being able to anticipate the excitement around an All-Ireland final.ldquoWersquore delighted to be there, first and foremost. We are buzzing with excitement. And the other thing is too, especially with the dficulties that so many people are going through, we are able to feed off the excitement of others.ldquoSo many people have been affected badly by Covid-, but you can see the dference sport can make.It can help communities come together and that is certainly something we can feel heading into this game.Down booked their spot in the final with a - to - semi-final success against Meath in Clones. It was a match where the Mourne girls looked fairly comfortable and had a gear or two to spare.McMullan concurs, saying they could have racked up an even more convincing winning margin.ldquoWe should have scored more, and could have done. But Meath held out well, and then it became more of a case of seeing the game out and protecting the advantage. We knew Meath are a very dficult team to overcome.ldquoBefore the match, we spoke about how close we had come before going all the way. We absolutely did not want to experience those feelings again. A lot of players, to be honest, were not over last yearrsquos loss to Westmeath. It hurt a lot.ldquoSometimes it can take you to lose a game of that importance to toughen you up, make you ready to go that bit more the next time. There is no doubt the girls have the hunger and are driven to win this now. As for the challenge posed by Antrim, the Down camp are certainly not under-estimating the task at hand, as Karen admits.ldquoItrsquoll be a tough one against Antrim. They are a very young, very fit, quick team. They have some of their top players from the likes of Loughgiel and Ballycastle. Itrsquos a local derby which obviously adds a bit more spice to things. Honestly, on the day, it is anyonersquos game.Anyonersquos game indeed, but Down will know they have weapons in their team that they will look to on the day to make the dference between the pain of coming runners-up again, and the glory of being crowned All-Ireland champions.Paula OrsquoHagan is someone the team will certainly be looking towards to presenting a threat in front of the Antrim goal. She was a constant thorn in the side of Meath in the last four, accounting for seven points.Sarah-Louise Graffin is also a threat going forward. She ably dovetailed with OrsquoHagan in the last four, weighing in with three points. When those two click going forward, they can be a handful for even the most miserly of back-lines.Fionnuala Carr is the glue that held that line together so well in the success over Meath, and no doubt she will be the bedrock that Down will try to build their success on again.As well as that, Dougan has the team well-drilled in defence. And ahead of them, they have a midfield prowess that can take a grip on a game against the best. Niamh Mallon is a constant danger to the opposition, full of busy running and creativity. Alongside her, Saoirse McCartan is another wily operator.Undoubtedly, Down possess the tools in their armoury to carry off the title this time around. In terms of talent, and the experience of being there before and knowing what to expect on the big occasion, they know the drill.Now Dougan, and the players will be hoping they can shake off the lsquonearlyrsquo tag and be crowned camogie queens of Ireland.The throw-in for Saturdayrsquos final is .pm.

In these strange and dficult times, even the strongest and most resilient among us are not exempt from occasionally feeling weary and despondent.During the early months of lockdown back in the spring, how many of us enjoyed the slowing down of the hamster wheel of le and took time to enjoy nature at its finest and to reflect on what our priorities really are It all seems much harder this time around as people face the harsh reality of a huge economic downturn and the virus pandemic takes on a dferent guise.We need all the help we can get to keep ourselves as positive and hopeful as possible. This is where mindfulness can come in. It is a term that has become popular in recent times and often is wrongly used.It can get a bad press and seem shrouded in mystery mdash something that requires a knowledge of Zen beyond the reach of lsquoJoe Publicrsquo while others claim it to be some kind of panacea that can cure all ills. It is neither of these things.As a practitioner for several years and a Mindfulness in Schools Project trained teacher for five, I can honestly say it is a tool that can help some peoplefocus on the present and not let the mind wander into unnecessary places, whether that be worries or distractions.The analogy of thoughts being like buses is one I like. We donrsquot need to jump on every single one, instead just watch them pass by.An example of a mindful experience could be when a musician is playing a piece and sensing the music, rather than reading the notes.It is flowing completely naturally and no thinking is involved. Sport is another great example. Novak Djokovic and Jonny Wilkinson are two advocates of mindful practice and both claim their focus and steady performance can be attributed to the discipline.Interestingly, two of the most mindful sports are golf and cricket. Being at one with the little white ball as it gets smacked about the greens is said to be as good for mental health as much as physical.Our own Rory McIlroy summed it up well when he said: ldquoIrsquom not about to go and live with the monks in Nepal or anything like that, but Irsquom making sure that I centre myself and put my head in the right place.Cricket is similar.When you are bowling an over, the focus is on the line of the ball, the position of the field and the feel of the wicket under foot. The batsman is equally focussing on the ball and the fielders woe betide they lose their concentration.The halcyon days of local cricket as a mainstream sport appear to be over at the moment and there are multiple reasons offered for the demise mdash schools having less time for summer sports in the final term, the attention span of young players not being what it was and fewer people willing to commit to what could be a full day.Which leads me nicely back to the beginning.Remember those lovely, slower days of lockdown when we realised being busy wasnrsquot necessarily all it was cracked up to be and that many of the things on our mental lsquoto dorsquo list are not that important after all Maybe we really need to take time to smell the autumn leaves, the way we did for the daffodils of spring. Maybe we need to slow it down and find things to hope for.Local cricket clubs donrsquot have the crowds around the team boards any more on a Thursday evening after the selection committee when the team lists were pinned up.There isnrsquot that excitement of ldquodid I make it from the thirds to the seconds   or for me, ldquowhere am I serving the sandwiches It is a dferent era for the game, but those who love it, really love it. If anyone reading this has their whites from a bygone time hidden in an attic somewhere, why not retrieve them and dust them down for next spring If you played a bit at school and just feel like revisiting the sport for a bit of exercise and a bit of craic with new people, then please do it.Evenyoursquove never played, but have walked down the Strangford Road and loved that beautul setting, then it might be worth a go.We all need things to look forward to and we all need hope. Downpatrick Cricket Club needs that hope too.Maurice Irvine, a dear friend and colleague and master of cricket at Down High School, is also a former player for the school and the club.He strongly recommends anyone to take up the bat again or try it out whatever level you are at.When I asked him how he felt at the possible closure of Downpatrick Cricket Club, he said:ldquoIt is with great sadness that I learn of this possibility. I have many memories of playing there under the guidance of Roy Briggs, Ken McCammon and many others, developing my love of the game. ldquoCricket is a great game educating young people especially in respect, fair play, how to win and lose with dignity and team spirit.ldquoDownpatrick Cricket Club, along with Saintfield and Dundrum, is also a great place for Down High cricketers to gain valuable experience and the opportunity to learn from more experienced cricketers.ldquoDownpatrick have also been very generous to Down High, allowing us access to nets when they were not available at school and I would add my encouragement to anyone in the area to become involved to help the club at this dficult time.For me, the Linehan family are synonymous with cricket in Downpatrick.Alfie and Hugh will remain heroes of mine always, while current club chairman Paul Linehan hopes thatanyone can assist to keep the club going they will contact him on   or email paul.k.linehan@gmail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 Drumaness.jpg","title":"Drumaness green space plans  ","story":"A NEW amenity area is to be created in Drumaness by Newry, Mourne and Down Council.An area known locally as the lsquoBack Fieldrsquo where a play park was located a number of years ago is to be redeveloped.The news has been welcomed by Slieve Croob councillor, Cathy Mason, who is pleased that a raised area made of bricks and concrete is to be flattened and reseeded with GAA and football posts and nets to be provided.The local politician, who has been lobbying for the work to be carried out, said it is now possible as the village has two play parks, explaining that the remnants of bricks and concrete at the back field can now be removed, with this particular work long over due. ldquoThe area will be flattened and seeded so it can be safely used, with a set of GAA and soccer nets provided, said Cllr Mason.ldquoWe all know how vital it is to get outside into the fresh air, especially our children during these unprecedented times.

The scheme is finally moving in the right direction and now is the time to commit the money to ensure its delivery.Cllr Terry Andrews also welcomed progress in the bypass which he said can make a signicant dference for not only Ballynahinch, but the wider East and South Down areas.Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, said people in Ballynahinch look forward to the delivery of the scheme, urging consideration be given to farmers whose land has ben set aside for  years to accommodate the planned bypass.ldquoThese farmers have been unable to do anything with these areas of land which will probably be vested. The situation they fund themselves in is not fair, he added.The Department for Infrastructurersquos network manager, James Kelly, said while a previous roads manager was minded to proceed with the Ballynahinch scheme, it did not reach the point of going ahead.He said there was now an opportunity for roads officials to refresh the schemersquos environmental assessments before presenting them to the minister again.Mr Kelly said with the scheme expected to cost between poundm and poundm,Mrs Mallon wishes for it to proceed, the bypass will have to enter a process where it will be competing for finance with other schemes.He added: ldquoWe cannot guarantee that the money will be available next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd December 2020 New.jpg","title":"New bus at Knockevin Special School following £28k donation  ","story":"KNOCKEVIN Special School in Downpatrick has taken charge of a new bus thanks to the generosity of the Lordrsquos Taverners and the schoolrsquos parent staff association.The PSA donated pound, towards the cost of the new wheelchair accessible bus which was provided by the Lordrsquos Taverners, which provides support for people with disabilities.The bus was recently handed over to the school by PSA members, who will also fund its running costs.The PSA was formed in  when parents and staff came together to fund music therapy for the pupils which was no longer being funded by the relevant authorities.The associationrsquos goal is to support all of the pupils at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and Knockevin Early Years Centre in Dundrum.PSA chairperson Kelley OrsquoReilly said: ldquoSince we formed we have raised considerable amounts of money through ious events and projects, such as the Sparkle Project in , with our previous chairperson Paula Dillon at the helm, which saw the local community come together to raise money for the refurbishment of two sensory rooms and the hydrotherapy pool.ldquoWe smashed our target of pound, to raise a staggering amount of over pound, and we were able to provide the school with a bicycle track and new bikes.ldquoWe funded a Memory Tree, which the school had wanted for some considerable time, designed and constructed by local artist Kevin Killen, to remember pupils who passed away while attending Knockevin.Kelley added: ldquoWe also have recently agreed to fund the refurbishment of the soft play area in the Profound and Multiple Learning Disabilities unit within the Downpatrick school site. Our next aim is to provide funding for outdoor gym play equipment which is essential at this time.Due to the Covid pandemic the PSA was forced to cancel or postpone many fundraising events such as the annual  and k runs and family fun walk.The bag pack at the Asda supermarket Downpatrick also had to be cancelled, although the PSA received a generous donation from Asda for its Christmas raffle.The tenth anniversary ball, which was to have been held in the Burrendale Hotel, has been put back until October .A drive-in movie screening of the Christmas film Elf at Letrsquos Go Hydro in Carryduff this Sunday has also been cancelled, but there are hopes that it can be rescheduled for a later date.Said Kelley: ldquoWe are always so grateful of all the support we receive not only from our parents, carers and school staff, who all volunteer their time to organise and carry out events, but also the local community.ldquoWithout everyonersquos help we would not be able to continue to support our amazing children and young adults, which is our purpose.She added: ldquoBoth school sites are held in such high regard by the local community and by parents and carers.ldquoWe look forward to a time when we can resume fundraising as a community again.

Five others were also wounded in the sectarian attack.Northern Irelandrsquos Lord Chief Justice, Sir Declan Morgan, welcomed the fact a settlement had been reached between the parties.ldquoWe congratulate the parties on finding an answer to this interesting and dficult, but also important case, he told lawyers in Belfast High Court.Last year, Sir Declan and other senior judges ruled search warrants used by police to search the journalistsrsquo home and their offices at Fine Point Films had been ldquoinappropriate, resulting in the criminal probe into Mr Birney and Mr McCaffrey being discontinued.The original police operation had been undertaken by Durham Constabulary at the request of the PSNI amid conflict of interest concerns.In the summer Chief Constable Simon Byrne issued an unreserved apology to the two men.Reacting to the settlement, Mr Birney said it marked an end to the legal process he began in a police cell at the end of August  after being arrested and his home and offices raided by dozens of PSNI and Durham police.ldquoWe launched a Judicial Review in the face of the PSNIrsquos most egregious attack on journalism to protect our journalism, our sources, and press freedom itself, he said.ldquoOver the past two years, thePSNI fought our attempts to protect our journalism and sources every step of the way.ldquoThey sought to defend their indefensible attack on press freedom right up until the judgment delivered by the Lord Chief Justice in July this year.Mr Birney said he and Mr McCaffrey have welcomed the Chief Constablersquos apology, but said no such apology has been received by Mr Byrnersquos predecessor, Sir George Hamilton, under whose leadership the PSNI arrested the two journalists.Mr Birney added: ldquoJournalists in this jurisdiction now need to see Simon Byrne take all steps necessary to ensure accountability for the PSNIrsquos despicable attack on press freedom and to assure the press that lessons have been learned..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12099002.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Research shows that marriage is good for families, it’s good for society, good for the wellbeing of our community. And we’ve decided to undermine that for the sake of a small number of people.“It’s my view that when a society undermines its basic building blocks of marriage, the family and the sanctity of le then that society inevitably suffers.“These fundamental changes to the society of Northern Ireland were rushed through after  minutes of a debate in Parliament, with no consultation whatsoever with the people of Northern Ireland or their elected representatives.“I have always maintained that the status of marriage should have been put to a referendum for the people of Northern Ireland to decide, after a full, intense and open debate - not rushed through late at night in Parliament.”Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland director of Amnesty International, one of the leaders of the Love Equality coalition, said: “Today has been a long time coming. It has taken years of campaigning and the efforts of thousands of people to secure the law change which has allowed these loving couples to finally become married couples.“The experience of the last decade tells us that, when we come together and stand up for what is right, we will prevail.

it was an unexpected vicious attack by another woman.ldquoAfter the attack I started to suffer from PTSD.ldquoI visited my doctor many times, how could I have PTSD ldquoI hadnt been to the front line.ldquoMy doctor told me it only takes one traumatic event or one moment when you believe your le could be lost.ldquoThe mental burden of PTSD is dreadful.ldquoI wouldnt wish that on anybody.ldquoIt has taken me over two years of my le to get to somewhere near normal and even now Im not the same person I was.ldquoThe writing was the escape I needed.ldquoWriting has aided my recovery so far and I would recommend this to anyone suffering from PTSD.ldquoAlthough Im left with the scars of PTSD, itrsquos is behind me now.ldquoWriting has now become a hobby for me and the sense of achievement - holding a published book in your hands that you have written is the best feeling.ldquoItrsquos great.Mrs Danter drew inspiration from a childrenrsquos book which she personally found horrying.ldquoI saw a childrens book called Dex and the Funfair by Paul Shipton.ldquoIn my opinion the story is shocking.ldquoEvenI wasnt part of the funfair industry myself, I wouldnt want my children to read such a book.ldquoThe worst part about this, is the book is fact that it is in some school libraries.The book details Dex smashing up a tin can alley stall and the stallholder giving Dex a prize to make him leave.ldquoThis is shocking on all levels, she said. ldquoAllowing children to read books like this at the age of five or six cannot be a good thing.ldquoMy second inspiration came when my nephew came on holiday with while we were on our travels, which in turn reminded me just how much fun it was growing up on the fairground.ldquoI decided to write Nelsons Funfair Holiday - a story about a little boy who goes to stay with his auntie who owns a funfair.ldquoThis story will give children a glimpse of what it is like visiting and growing up on the fairground.ldquoChildren in my opinion must have all the experiences le has to offer to broaden their minds ready for the wider world.ldquoTravelling fairgrounds are part of our heritage in the UK and across Europe.ldquoItrsquos our history, its who we are and we are all play a part in that, whether you grow up on the fairground or not.The Danters originally hail from Brynmawr.Goff Danter, an artist, was able to offer India tips and advice on illustrating the book which is her first having previously been commissioned to do pencil drawings under the trade name Romayne Art.Mrs Danter also has another book under her belt.Entitled Me and My Social Media, itrsquos a short, gripping story about the dark side of social media and how a perfectly normal family can be turned upside down.ldquoI am very proud of this book, she added. ldquoEverybody who reads it tells me they cannot put it until they have finished it.Nelsons Funfair Holiday costs pound. and is available from Amazon and Waterstones. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityResidents of the village, on a key road between Barry and Cardf, have been waiting since the spring for a key Vale of Glamorgan council report on the Dinas Powys bypass and other potential transport improvements.In September Councillor Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the WelTAG Stage Two report would be published in November.Essential for getting funding, the report will set out the business case for the transport improvements to the Welsh Government. It was not published last month. The council has said the latest delay was due to the need for ldquofurther analysis of traffic data.Chris Franks, a Plaid Cymru community councillor, called the latest delay a ldquodisgrace and said several main junctions in Dinas Powys urgently need improving.The Dinas Powys Steering Group held a public meeting pre-covidHe said: ldquoThis important report was supposed to have been available last June or July. Then excuses were made that it would be ready in November. So now December is here,where is this report ldquoThis study is much more than the issue of a bypass mdash there are so many poor quality junctions to consider. There is a need for traffic-calming, and improved bus and train services will be required once the pandemic is over.He pointed to three dficult junctions in the village: Millbrook Road with Pen-Y-Turnpike Road Leckwith Road with Pen-Y-Turnpike Road and Station with Cardf Road.He added: ldquoWe think theyrsquove lost interest in the project. Theyrsquove given priority on the road up to the M, that seems to be their priority at the moment.ldquoBut this affects the thousands of motorists who are driving to and from Barry every day. It serves thousands of Barry residents.The council has said more details about the plans should be revealed this month, and a decision on the improvements could be made as soon as February.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoThe council is now due to receive the draft WelTAG Stage  plus report lsquoImprovements to Transport in Dinas Powys reportrsquo from the consultants undertaking the work on this project in December .ldquoThe delay has been caused by the need for further analysis related to the recent traffic modelling data which has been collected for the project.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aedfaafacdfccee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeccfabcdde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
