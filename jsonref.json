University president Ken Starr was demoted and then resigned.The university since then has settled several lawsuits from women who said their allegations of sexual assault by football players were mishandled or ignored.Baylor officials settled a federal lawsuit last year involving a former volleyball player who said she was drugged and gang raped by members of the football team in 2012.A former Baylor student accused of raping a woman at a fraternity party was granted a plea deal in December that let him avoid serving jail time.Last June, a McLennan County grand jury declined to indict two Baylor football players accused of sexual assault.

Once the go-to place for casual clothing, Gap has been mired in a sales funk for years, hurt by increasing competition from the likes of Target and Amazon.Analysts applauded the move.\u0027This is great news for Old Navy, no longer having its success consistently outweighed by sluggish performance by Gap,\u0027 said Tiffany Hogan, senior analyst at Kantar Consulting. \u0027But for the Gap, this seems like potentially a last significant effort to help the brand find its place in a market where it has lost relevance.\u0027          The separate company will consist of the iconic Gap brand, Athleta, Banana Republic, Intermix and Hill City (Banana Republic, Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn in New York)          The new company will be based in Gap Inc.\u0027s current headquarters and Old Navy will remain at its current headquarters, both located in San Francisco (Athleta store in Scarsdale, New York)She noted that in order for Gap to succeed, it needs to find the right mix of style and basics for its stores, while getting a better grasp of who its customer is.Separately, Gap Inc. reported that Gap\u0027s overall sales at stores opened at least a year were down 1 percent during the fiscal fourth quarter. By ision, the Gap brand posted a 5 percent drop, while that figure at Banana Republic was down 1 percent. Old Navy posted sales that were unchanged from a year ago. But that was on top of a 9 percent gain in the year-ago period.\u0027It\u0027s clear that Old Navy\u0027s business model and customers have increasingly erged from our specialty brands over time, and each company now requires a different strategy to thrive moving forward,\u0027 said Robert Fisher, Gap Inc.\u0027s chairman.

The British brand opened in 1990 and is now well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities and royals including Kate Middleton who is pictured wearing dresses from the brand during a tour of Australia in 2014Fashion brand Orla Kiely, which was also loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, also went out of business with debts of more than £7.25m (€8.1m) last year. High Street clothing giant Gap also announced today that it will close 230 stores worldwide as its US parent company launches a massive restructuring programme.The closures amount to nearly a fifth of its total shops although the company has not said where stores will shut or how many jobs will be affected.           Shoppers have said the brand put prices up after Kate Middleton started wearing their clothes          LK Bennett is the latest big name to become a casualty in the bloodbath on the high street          The Sludge wedge increased by £20 after it became popular with Kate Middleton          LK Bennett\u0027s Natalie clutch bag also increased in price by £20 in 2012Both of these items saw their price increase by £20 after the royal was snapped in public with them.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail how labels can struggle to keep up with demand  after  public figures wear their clothes.She said: \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand\u0027 can \u0027involve huge costs for the label.\u0027                                                    However customers have said the store \u0027put their prices up\u0027 after Kate started being seen wearing their clothes and got engaged to Prince William.Others have also criticised the brand\u0027s prices, saying \u0027that not many people have £300 spare to buy one dress\u0027.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.Ms Shiels added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once.\u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.\u0027Fashion commentator Karine Laudort also told MailOnline: \u0027The Duchess of Cambridge may be a fan but the everyday woman in Britain may think twice before spending an extra £100 on a outfit, \u0027Especially when most online retailers now offer free 24-hour or same day delivery.\u0027 Today the brand was running an offer for 25 per cent off the entire new season range online and in store.Customers could also enjoy free UK delivery on all orders. Items  in the new range that were eligible for the discount included colourful court shoes priced at £195, a gold envelope clutch bag costing £175 and a variety of midi dresses costing around £300.  LK Bennett is well known for its signature kitten heels favoured by celebrities such as Holly Willoughby and royals including Kate Middleton.Kate took a two year hiatus from the brand and wasn\u0027t spotted wearing it on any public occasions after August 2016. But she reaffirmed her love for it, just a few months ago – wearing a green and cream silk polka dot dress for a visit to the Evelina London Children\u0027s hospital, in December 2018.           Kate, pictured at Kings Cross St Pancras station in London, also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen in March 2012  Holly Willoughby, left in one of the brand\u0027s dresses at the Chelsea Flower Show in May and Katherine Jenkins, right in the Izzy dress and Priyanka Courts at her album signing in London in December, are also among the famous fans of the fashion label          Linda Bennett, pictured at Buckingham Palace, received an OBE for services to the fashion industry in the New Year Honours list in 2016Kate also chose a teal suit from the brand for her first official engagement with the Queen during her Diamond Jubilee UK Tour in 2012. This elegant look included the £395 Jude jacket and £225 Davina dress which she paired with a pillbox hat by James Lock. High Street clothing giant Gap to close 230 stores worldwide...The curse of Kate!

Linda Bennett, pictured, came back to the company in 2017 after leaving in 2008 when she sold her majority stake  for between £80m and 100mBennett founded the brand 29 years ago in 1990 with a store in Wimbledon, London. The brand grew quickly into an international chain and Bennett decided to sell the business to Phoenix Equity Partners and Sirius Equity in 2008 for around £80-100million.Despite having sold off the brand she retained a stake on the company board, before re-joining in 2017 as a consultant to the management team.In September 2017 Bennett increased her investment in the company and bought out the remaining equity from private equity owner Phoenix Equity Partners and at the time the brand was operating more than 260 shops and concessions in more than 30 countries.After the acquisition by Bennett the company stated that it would continue to expand and subsequently launched stores in China, Russia and the US.  The curse of Kate! How the Duchess\u0027 endorsement of L.K.Bennett could have contributed to its downfall as the brand struggled to keep up with demand for designs the royal woreLK Bennett, a favourite of Duchess Kate, is set to file for administrationBranding expert Claire Shiels told Femail it can be a \u0027nightmare\u0027 if Kate is photographed wearing an item from the high street brandShoppers more likely to buy one-offs rather than become regular customers For any fashion brand, having a member of the royal family wear your clothes might seem like the ultimate endorsement, but while the \u0027Kate effect\u0027 can boost sales, it  wasn\u0027t enough to save one of her high street favourites, L.K.Bennett.The high street fashion house, a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge, is set to file for administration, putting up to 500 jobs at risk.  Branding expert Claire Shiels told Femail: \u0027Celebrity endorsement is the holy grail for any retailer, although it can bring with it as many problems as benefits.\u0027Having your high street label worn in public by one of the world\u0027s most photographed women can prove to be a nightmare if you\u0027re not forewarned, which is usually the case with Kate Middleton.           Kate Middleton, 37, pictured in Belfast, Northern Ireland on Wednesday wearing her go-to black boots from LK Bennett. The high street store is set to file for administration\u0027Retailers must walk a fine line between supply and demand, with production based on a number of factors including historical sales figures, market trends and buyer behaviour. \u0027A sudden and unexpected spike in sales and demand, which is what happens to a garment when the Duchess is spotted wearing it, often means that another immediate production run is required to satisfy demand and maximise the sales opportunity. \u0027Unfortunately, this can involve huge costs for the label, which then is unable to forecast when the sales surge is likely to suddenly drop again. \u0027The science behind production is therefore thrown into disarray and costs can easily spiral.\u0027 The Duchess, 37, has been spotted wearing L.K. Bennett numerous times - from a printed blue and white dress to her go-to black booties.Claire added: \u0027The problem for labels with Kate in particular, is that she chooses staple wardrobe items that are typically priced at the higher end for high street retailers and wears them more than once. \u0027This means that typically, her fashion followers will only purchase one item per season, rather than buying into the brand and shopping with them all year long.           The Duchess of Cambridge sporting an LK Bennett dress for a dinner at Kensington Palace, London, during former US President Barack Obama\u0027s state visit to Britain in 2016          Kate, 37, wore a white and blue floral L.K.Bennett dress during a visit to Luton with national charity Youthscape in August 2016\u0027Despite the financial woes currently experienced by some of her favourite labels however, it is the market – not Kate - that is to blame for the mass closure of many high street stores. \u0027As well as L.K.Bennett Hobbs, Orla Kiely, Alice Temperley and Issa have all experienced significant financial difficulties.\u0027Although it\u0027s a difficult time for retail, Claire claims some lower-priced brands including Zara and Primark have got it right.She said: \u0027Zara is in the enviable position to have been able to bring its manufacturing process in-house rather than outsourcing abroad, meaning costs are reduced and the brand is able to react quickly to a sudden increase in demand. \u0027At the other end of the scale, Primark is continuing to thrive due, it is said to its mass market appeal and its focus on engagement with its customers through social media.\u0027It is the stores which are best able to adapt and have a supply chain flexible enough to cope with fluctuating demand and market trends which will survive.

Never has there been a more assertive uncle than Amran. From 7am to 9.30pm every other weekend, Ishal has an intense schedule with him that includes watching the news, writing to MPs and penning novels. He\u0027s even researched the best place to position her eyes to stimulate the optimum parts of her brain when answering difficult questions (straight ahead or right — never left).Still, the sweet-faced girl with the pretty hairband remains unfazed and shows a reassuring impish side when recalling her time on the show.\u0027Before the show presenter Richard Osman was really funny and made lots of jokes to lighten the mood. He\u0027d say, \u0027Oh my God, I\u0027m scared of you guys. You\u0027re so brainy!\u0027 Then he knocked his head on the door frame — he\u0027s 6 ft 7 in,\u0027 she giggles.Ishal, who wants to be an astronaut after studying Maths at Oxford or Cambridge, has an IQ that puts her in the top one per cent in the country. \u0027He\u0027s our Child Genius regardless\u0027: Viewers praise \u0027normal\u0027...Twelve-year-old with an IQ higher than EINSTEIN stuns...Share this articleBut she\u0027s not just academically brilliant. The breadth and scale of her talents, energy levels and determination is extraordinary.As well as winning a full bursary and a music scholarship to St Swithun\u0027s, a high-achieving independent girls\u0027 school in Winchester, she is also sporty. She rides, enjoys archery, plays polo (she calls it \u0027hockey on a horse\u0027) and fences competitively.While at her junior school, she was a chorister at Portsmouth Cathedral. Today, she\u0027s the only Muslim organist in the country (possibly the world), and a member of the Royal School of Church Music.She chose the organ because, with its three keyboards and pedals, \u0027it\u0027s more of a challenge than the piano\u0027.\u0027It was a struggle to fit everything in at junior school, because I\u0027d go swimming after school, then I had extra tuition and then Mummy took me to the church to practise the organ. The priest gave us a key so we could let ourselves in.\u0027But there\u0027s another story emerging behind all this ambition, hard work and talent, which hasn\u0027t been lost on the Child Genius audience, and that is Uncle Amran.          The twelve-year-old is being helped by her Uncle Amran- an Oxford graduate who has deployed every technique he knows to try to give his beloved niece the edge over her competitorsSo intense is his interest, and pride in his niece, that those watching often have to remind themselves that he\u0027s not Ishal\u0027s father.His own story is one of innate brilliance. Amran, the brother of Ishal\u0027s mother Momtaj, was a child genius himself who obtained 26 GCSEs — all at top grades — at a comprehensive school in a deprived area of east London.From there he won a place at Eton, \u0027But our Dad didn\u0027t want him to leave home so he didn\u0027t go,\u0027 explains Momtaj.Although Amran missed out on a public school education, he still won a scholarship to study Medicine at Oxford and now works as a health care consultant.But perhaps this lost opportunity has sharpened his resolve that Ishal grabs every one that comes her way.Certainly he and his niece have a rapport: \u0027Uncle Amran helped me. Although he hasn\u0027t got kids he has two cats he treats like his children,\u0027 she smiles.Today Amran, who lives in rural Berkshire, is keen to take a back seat — after all, this is Ishal\u0027s time to shine — but Momtaj says: \u0027Amran spoils all his 35 nieces and nephews and is keen for them all to succeed, as he has. \u0027He\u0027s absolutely passionate about education and has a special bond with Ishal. They share the same sense of humour.                             He\u0027s absolutely passionate about education and has a special bond with Ishal                        \u0027When she wanted to enter Child Genius I said: \u0027I don\u0027t know if I can handle the pressure!\u0027 That\u0027s when Amran stepped up and said, \u0027I\u0027ll always be there to help.\u0027Such a breathless catalogue of talent as Ishal\u0027s could make a child insufferable, but she remains sweet-natured and modest. I ask how she\u0027d describe herself.\u0027Adventurous and compassionate,\u0027 she says, \u0027I\u0027m a daredevil! I love roller-coasters, especially the vertical drop ones. And I want to go bungee-jumping, but you have to weigh 45 kilos and I\u0027m not heavy enough. I want to go sky-ing, and to abseil down the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, too. But you have to be 18.\u0027Momtaj rolls her eyes. \u0027She wants to do anything and everything,\u0027 she says, adding that the sports her daughter most enjoys are the risky kind. \u0027We think she\u0027s broken her nose falling off her horse playing polo,\u0027 she says. Ishal looks cheerfully unconcerned.You might imagine her background is a privileged and wealthy one — but Ishal\u0027s family are very modest.Forhad, 40, grafts up to 80 hours a week as a taxi driver. Momtaj, 36, works as a physiotherapist in an NHS stroke unit even though she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis.Forhad was born and raised in Bangladesh and came to the UK to marry Momtaj, one of eight siblings brought up in east London, when she was 18.They have imbued Ishal and her brother Zeeshan, 11, with their fierce work ethic. In a TV arena that attracts the worst kind of overbearing parents, the disarming thing about the Mahmud family is their absence of pushiness or pretension.Home is a small terrace in Portsmouth. You sense that humanity, tolerance and modesty are as important to them as academic attainment. Momtaj, who is chatty and outgoing, is keen to show me the certificate Ishal won for kindness.\u0027She was raised to be a good human being first and foremost,\u0027 says Forhad. \u0027I did a read-a-thon for Children in Need when I was at primary school,\u0027 adds Ishal. \u0027I read 87 books one holiday.\u0027On inset days if Mum went shopping I\u0027d sit in the library and read. I love books. My favourite place is the library. I used to ask Mum, \u0027Can I use your library card as well as mine?\u0027\u0027I\u0027ll lie on my bed and read a whole book at one sitting and Mum will come in and say, \u0027Are you still reading?\u0027 Then she\u0027ll take the book away from me — but I\u0027ll just find another one,\u0027 she says with a smile.Their Muslim faith is observed strictly but tolerantly: they want both their children to learn about and embrace other religions. At home they speak English and Bengali.Like Amran, you sense that Ishal\u0027s parents are also keen to make sure their children make up for the opportunities in life they missed.The couple got together while young in an arranged marriage.\u0027I couldn\u0027t study beyond 18. Life wasn\u0027t easy for my parents. But if I can help our kids I will,\u0027 says Momtaj. \u0027Last year Ishal wanted to go skiing with the school but we couldn\u0027t afford it. This year we\u0027re working on it. We\u0027re saving up and Ishal has asked for money at Eid and on her birthday, so we hope we\u0027ll have enough for her to go.\u0027Forhad, who gained a law degree in Bangladesh, could not afford to qualify at an English university when he came to the UK.\u0027We encourage our children in all their activities so they can enjoy a bright future,\u0027 he says.\u0027We\u0027re not pushy at all. The kids try to do more study and we tell them to watch TV to give their minds a little break, or we take them to their cousins\u0027 house. We don\u0027t believe in pushing them to work, work, work.\u0027I\u0027m quite sporty. I go to the gym and play badminton. If I\u0027ve been driving my taxi for 17 hours, I have to, and we encourage the children to enjoy sports, too.\u0027What makes a child genius? Ishal is greedy for knowledge. She absorbs information readily, as a parched plant soaks up water. But she doesn\u0027t just remember facts: \u0027I don\u0027t like learning by rote,\u0027 she explains. \u0027I have to understand everything first, and know how things relate to each other.\u0027She spent around nine hours a day at weekends, and five hours on school days, revising for the competition.\u0027We\u0027d get lots of books and I\u0027d read them all and we\u0027d highlight important facts.\u0027If I didn\u0027t understand something I\u0027d Google it or ask my uncle or parents, then we\u0027d make flashcards with questions on them and my parents would test me.\u0027The first half of the day I might practise spellings, then, during the competition, there are about 200 pieces of information on different subjects to learn every day.\u0027These rounds of the contest are fiendishly difficult tests of memory and mental dexterity. In one, competitors had an hour to memorise the common and Latin names of obscure sea creatures.In another they had a mere four billion years of the entire history of the earth to absorb. Then there were the spelling tests: words so abstruse as to be unpronounceable, yet the young would- be geniuses have to spell them, as well as solving hugely tricky mental maths problems.Ishal thrives on such challenges. Her active brain is always buzzing. \u0027If I\u0027m not completely engaged in a conversation I\u0027m thinking about things I\u0027m solving random mental maths problems in my head, like what is 163 squared?\u0027 (Answer 26,569.)\u0027There\u0027s no sign in her face but I know when her brain is working on something,\u0027 agrees Momtaj. \u0027She\u0027s not 100 per cent with us.\u0027 She is also an accomplished multi-tasker: \u0027Even when I\u0027m watching TV I\u0027ll be knitting a scarf or blanket for a charity, or colouring,\u0027 says Ishal.Right from her earliest years, her parents knew she was exceptionally bright. Momtaj recalls: \u0027She said her first word, Baba (daddy) at seven months and at nine months was singing along with me to nursery rhymes.\u0027I took her to Bangladesh at ten months and she was learning Bengali words very quickly because she was so easy to teach.\u0027Then at her junior school we thought: \u0027OK, we have to earn some more money to get her music lessons and extra tuition.\u0027I ask her if her brightness set her apart from her classmates at primary school whether being so far ahead of them marked her as an oddity. But Ishal is not a show-off.\u0027I used to pretend I couldn\u0027t do things sometimes,\u0027 she admits. \u0027And I have lots of friends.\u0027I\u0027d hang out with them because I like them. They don\u0027t have to be clever.\u0027It was Ishal herself who asked Momtaj if she could enter Child Genius. \u0027I watched it on TV and I could answer quite a lot of the questions. I said to Mum, \u0027Can I go on that programme?\u0027 and Mum said I could give it a try.\u0027So they whittled all the applicants down, first to 100 and then 30, then those with the highest scores came back for more brain puzzles until they got us down to the 20 contestants.\u0027Clearly, even among the brightest of her peers, Ishal has always stood out. She was offered places — with scholarships or bursaries — at ten independent schools, but chose St Swithun\u0027s because they were \u0027so friendly and I liked the vibe.\u0027\u0027It\u0027s an all-girls\u0027 school. That\u0027s important, too,\u0027 she adds. \u0027Boys would be a distraction. I can\u0027t be bothered with them.\u0027She finishes her homework quickly — she\u0027s effortlessly accomplished — and after evening prayers she might review books or write letters. As a member of the UK Youth Parliament for Hampshire constituency (she won the candidacy in the face of competition from 16-year-olds), she often corresponds with her MP.I ask her how she relaxes. \u0027Mmmm,\u0027 she ponders. \u0027There\u0027s no such thing as relaxing, although I do sometimes like to watch movies.\u0027Her favourite subject is maths. Little wonder she is setting her sights stratospherically high in her ambition to conquer space.\u0027I\u0027m aiming to work for NASA as an astronaut. I\u0027d like to study the universe. I used to ask about space constantly when I was younger, and I wanted to know all the answers. I wanted to learn beyond what people already knew.\u0027I still have this thirst to find out more than what is known.\u0027Actually my ambition is to be the first person on Mars.\u0027With her questing mind, her prodigious intelligence — and her great head for heights — it doesn\u0027t seem such an impossible dream."},{"url":null,"title":"Ocados dumping Waitrose M S sparking panic shires best","story":"    So just how do M\u0026ampS staples stack up against Waitrose own-brand produce?

It\u0027s full of chunky chicken and tomatoWaitrose — Indian chicken tikka masala (350g)PRICE: £3.99TASTE: Billed as ‘marinated chargrilled chicken in a tandoori-spiced cream and tomato sauce’, this Indian classic sounds mouth-watering. The reality is a let-down: insipid sauce and barely any meat.M\u0026ampS — Chicken tikka masala (400g)PRICE: £4TASTE: There’s more kick to this, which is full of chunky chicken and tomato. It’s also less fatty, so I don’t feel guilty tucking in.Winner: M\u0026ampS.

But the sauce is cloying, and the slices of beef are pitifully thin.Winner: Waitrose, by a whisker. Both are pricey options, and neither lives up to expectations.APPLE PIE          Waitrose\u0027s is made with whole apples, blackberries and apple puree.

There’s barely any filling and the icing comes away at the sides.Winner: Waitrose.

It’s a little too dry and vanilla-like for me, and doesn’t pack much alcohol per volume.Winner: Waitrose. It’s worth paying extra for a wine so surprisingly good.RED WINE          Winner: M\u0026ampS. A classy supermarket wine for just over a fiverWaitrose — Soft and juicy Chilean (12.5 per cent vol)PRICE: £4.99TASTE: This is meant to be ‘mellow’ and ‘chocolatey’, but from the first sip mine tastes bland and lifeless.

Their story has inspired the West End romantic musical Come From Away (pictured) at the Phoenix Theatre in LondonThat awful backdrop was the events of September 11, 2001 when the pair, both complete strangers, stepped on the same plane at Gatwick, heading for Houston, Texas.Nick, an oil executive from the Cotswolds, was on business. Diane, a buyer for a department store in Texas, was heading home after visiting her son and his family in England.Nick was 53 Diane had just turned 60. Both were orcees and neither was looking for romance. They weren’t even sitting near each other on the Continental Airways flight. Nick was at the back and Diane was up front.Four hours into the flight, the captain announced that there was a problem. Due to ‘issues’ with American air space, the flight would not be continuing to Texas, but would be going to Newfoundland instead. Cue lots of tutting and muttered cursing, as plans were scuppered and inconveniences piled up. ‘I had a vague idea where Newfoundland was,’ admits Nick. ‘But I had to check on a map.’Looking back, however, both remember a distinct change of atmosphere on the plane as it headed away from American airspace.          Nick, an oil executive from the Cotswolds, was on business when he met Diane, a buyer for a department store in Texas, who was heading home after visiting her son and his family in England‘I remember one flight attendant looking so nervous that I questioned whether she had the right temperament for the job. I realised after that that she was walking up and down the plane looking for suspicious characters, thinking we could be next,’ says Nick.Diane was oblivious. ‘I was thinking it was probably a computer glitch that had brought the system down,’ she saysNick and Diane, like everyone else on the plane, were clueless as to the events that were folding in the States. Four passenger airliners had been hijacked by terrorists, two of which were flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in Manhattan. The terrible events of that day were to leave 2,996 people dead, and 6,000 injured.They were also to maroon 7,000 passengers — including Nick and Diane — on Newfoundland, an island off the coast of Canada, as American airspace was cleared.The town of Gander, where they landed, has a population of just 10,000. Nick remembers landing at the town’s airport, and being greeted by a remarkable sight: 38 jumbo jets, all lined up ‘like sardines’.Pretty Woman to strut on to a West End stage: Musical...Just William? He\u0027s just Britain at its brilliant best! The...Share this articleDespite being woefully ill-equipped to deal with the sudden influx of visitors, disembarking their planes with only their hand luggage, the locals coped.The mayor of Gander declared a state of emergency and local residents swung into action. They opened their schools, bars, even homes to the newcomers, providing them with everything from toothbrushes to mobile phones. They also collected every barbecue in the town for a mass hospitality evening.They arranged get-togethers, sing-alongs even, in the local bars. It was, everyone would agree, the perfect conditions for a romantic drama.For five days, Nick and Diane were plunged into this bizarre alternative existence. It wasn’t hell on earth by any means. ‘That made it difficult to cope with in some ways, after,’ says Nick. ‘It was actually enjoyable, which is hard when you remember why we were there.’Nick and Diane hadn’t met on the flight. They first exchanged words in a queue for bedding, with Nick’s opening gambit to the woman who would become his wife being about the pungent smell of mothballs. Hardly textbook romance.They then ended up sleeping next to each other in army-issue cot beds. They laugh when they recall how Diane always insisted on wearing a full face of make-up, despite everything, just like the heroine in a disaster movie.‘I had my make-up bag with me, and every day I’d get up early, before Nick was awake, and put it on. I wore the same clothes for four days — I only had the clothes I stood up in — but the make-up was my way of staying normal, I guess of holding onto the normal.’Over the course of the next five days, as the scale of the atrocity became clear, they clung together — sometimes literally, for instance when TV screens were erected so news could be broken to the visitors about what was unfolding at Ground Zero — to the point where locals assumed that they were man and wife.When the mayor discovered that they weren’t, he offered to marry them. Diane said: “Why not?” Nick was a bit surprised by this jokey aside, ‘but in a good way’, he says.They passed the time, playing silly games organised by the locals and going for long, contemplative walks. The mood was part-mourning (one woman spent the time waiting for news about her son, who was a firefighter in New York), part-party.When the planes that had been grounded that day finally took off, that could have been the end of the story. Yet the pair kept in touch via email and telephone. Their ‘end of the world’ romance became more rounded, more real. By October, Nick had told his bosses in London that he needed to return to the States to check on his ‘project’. He points theatrically to Diane.          When the planes that had been grounded that day finally took off, that could have been the end of their love story. But they kept in touch via email and telephone. Their  romance became more rounded and by October Nick had told his bosses in London that he needed to return to the States to check on his ‘project\u0027. He proposed and prepared to move across the Atlantic‘My colleagues didn’t know at first, but as time went on I think they suspected.’ He proposed, and prepared to move across the Atlantic.Diane sold her small house — the one she had reckoned was just fine for a single orcee with no plans to remarry — and bought a bigger one.‘I hadn’t told my children at first, not until I knew it was serious. But when Nick came over to visit, they met him.’ Nick nods. ‘They had to vet me.’ He clearly passed the test.On September 7, almost a year after the awful events of that day, Nick and Diane married. And for their honeymoon, they returned to Gander where the locals would throw them the party to end all parties.And now 17 years on, the happy couple are still canoodling on the sofa. It’s the most heart-warming of tales, and one which is now being told on stages all over the world.No blockbuster movie this time, but their story — fleetingly told in a documentary — touched a couple of drama students some years back. The pair, Irene Sankoff and David Hein, then wrote a musical based on those five days in Gander.The news simply baffled Nick and Diane. ‘To be honest, I thought: “Well, good luck with that,” ’ says Nick. ‘It didn’t seem musical material to us at all. And it was a college project. It never occurred to us that anything would become of it. In fact, I remember thinking they’d be on welfare the next year.’Well, no. Come From Away opened in Canada in 2013, and by 2017 it was a Broadway show, playing to packed audiences and receiving rave reviews. The show opened in London’s West End two weeks ago, with Nick and Diane in the audience. There have been standing ovations every night.It’s a stunning show, utterly life-affirming, somehow. Why do they think it has touched so many?‘Because while 911 was about the worst of humanity what happened in Gander over those five days was about the best of humanity. Those people opened their town and their hearts to us. It’s a story of human kindness.’There was not a happy ending for everyone that day. The lady who spent the five days fretting about her son discovered, when she returned to New York, that he had perished when the twin towers came down.Nick sat next to her at one performance. ‘I just reached over and put my hand on her arm. It was incredibly emotional for everyone.’Today, their account of their extraordinary courtship is by turns moving and hilarious. ‘It’s hard to explain, but in that environment, when you really don’t know if you are on the brink of another world war or if you are even going to be here tomorrow, you skip the surface chat,’ says Nick. To Diane’s great surprise, she found it easier than expected to let her hair down.‘There was an odd freedom in being in that environment,’ she says. ‘We all have our set roles in life — mother, grandmother, whatever — and we play them. But I wasn’t a grandmother there. There were no roles.’There’s a foot-stomping riot of a scene in the show where the visitors party hard with the locals, and throw themselves into local rituals involving rum and kissing a cod (yes, really). They were made honorary locals by this ‘screeching-in’ ceremony. Did they realise at the time they were on the verge of something life-changing, in terms of their relationship?‘I think I did,’ says Nick. ‘I knew there was something special about this lady. I couldn’t stop looking at her.’During one outing to Dover Fault, a beauty spot, Nick took his camera, supposedly to get some landscape shots. He found himself going out of his way to get pictures not of the scenery but of Diane.‘I thought: “I don’t know if I will ever see her again. I want to remember how she looked.” ’Neither truly thought they could be a proper item, but on a rickety bus journey back to the airport, something changed. Diane was emotional Nick leaned in to comfort her. He insists he was not going in for a kiss. ‘Well, I was, but I was going to kiss her forehead.’Diane laughs again. Whatever, their lips locked and that was it. They canoodled, they confirm, all the way back to the UK.‘There’s a scene in the show where the stewardess is bringing towels for everyone and she goes: “Hot towels? Hot towels?” all the way down the plane. When she gets to us, she says: “Cold towels?” That’s exactly as it happened.’Nick had suggested that they live in the UK, but Diane — who has three children and five grandchildren — insisted that the weather was better in Texas.Their honeymoon on Gander was quite the event. ‘We told the people we were coming back and that we’d love to have a party, which we would pay for, but would they help us organise it? Yet, when we got there, they’d organised everything: food, flowers, a huge meal. They wouldn’t let us pay for a thing.’They have been back many times to Newfoundland, and talk of their second ‘Newfie family’.Each anniversary of the date they met is difficult, though. ‘We’ve had survivor’s guilt. It’s a difficult thing to come to terms with. We met because this awful thing happened,’ says Nick.’They are a wonderful couple — unassuming, hilarious, a perfect match. Nick ribs his wife constantly about the age difference between them, but do they think they would have been together had they met in different circumstances?‘No, I don’t,’ says Diane. ‘It was a unique situation: 3,000 people had died, and there was this sense of “that could have been us”. It focuses the mind.I remember thinking: “How long do I have left? A year?

(Stock image)Although the Rugby Football Union’s (RFU) ticketing policy – in which 41,000 are offered to rugby clubs, schools and colleges – is intended to prioritise commercial supporters of the team and avid rugby fans, it seems to instead be feeding the secondary ticketing website vultures.Hundreds of fans are turning to websites like Viagogo in desperation to watch England play, and are spending vastly-inflated sums for tickets that may not even get them through the Twickenham turnstiles.The RFU says it will refuse entry to fans who buy tickets on resale sites and has threatened to take action against any clubs or members who obtain priority tickets – which can cost as little as £20 – and sell them on for a profit.\u0027I was in so much pain\u0027: Soccer star who feared she would...It\u0027s time for Eddie Jones to rest Owen Farrell after defeat...Share this articleDespite the warnings, tickets for England’s match against Scotland on March 16 are still being offered for sale on Viagogo at up to £1,000 each.The way seats at Twickenham were distributed for the most recent home game, a 44-8 victory over France last month, illustrates why tickets for the Six Nations can be so hard to come by for fans. In addition to the 11,480 seats set aside for England Rugby Hospitality by the RFU, 1,640 were reserved for ‘commercial sponsors’.Debenture holders – who are granted a ten-year right to ticket issues – accounted for just under 20 per cent of the ticket-holders, with 15,580 seats. Clubs, schools and colleges and other groups, including visiting rugby union members, RFU staff and former players, took the bulk of the remaining seats.           Despite warnings from the Rugby Football Union, tickets for England’s match against Scotland on March 16 are still being offered on Viagogo. (Stock image)A paltry four per cent of tickets – 3,280 – were allocated to what the RFU calls ‘fans’. But according to the union, this category is defined as ‘England Rugby Club members, England Rugby Travel customers, 02 priority members and residents living in the leafy suburb of Twickenham’.A spokesman for the RFU said: ‘We are a union ultimately run by our membership – rugby clubs. Our clubs pay subscriptions and associated fees, and we offer international tickets to our membership first.‘We also allocate tickets to rugby clubs to promote the game of rugby and help enable fans to come to Twickenham.’Constitutionally, at least 50 per cent of the seats at Twickenham have to be allocated to our rugby clubs.’The RFU said the number of tickets available to the public varies on a game by game basis, depending on the take-up from clubs. More tickets are likely to be available for matches against smaller nations. The RFU also confirmed that members were entitled to cheaper tickets.Another way to access seats is through a £25 annual membership of England Rugby.But Six Nations tickets were sold to members last year and the club is not currently accepting new members.

The former education secretary has spearheaded a series of radical reforms to raise standards and toughen up qualificationsAsked if Vote Leave misled voters in the 2016 referendum into thinking immigration would fall after Brexit, he said people had wanted ‘democratic control’ over numbers.‘The second thing is we’ve seen public attitudes towards migration change,’ he added.‘Now that people know that we have democratic control, actually there’s been a greater degree of acceptance of migration overall.’The Environment Secretary said people were ‘more tolerant’ in countries like Australia and Canada, where governments could set numbers.Asked where that left Theresa May’s target to cut immigration to the tens of thousands, he said voters could use their vote at general elections to punish a government they disagreed with.Mr Gove admitted that when he decided to back the Leave campaign in 2016 he thought it would lose.He said: ‘My own view was that actually I didn’t think we would win the referendum, I didn’t think we would leave, although I’m glad that was the result.’He confirmed he urged David Cameron strongly not to hold a referendum, as it would ‘create isions’.‘I remember saying at the time... that I didn’t think that it was a good idea,’ he said. "},{"url":null,"title":"B B owner finally ties knot partner pops question herself","story":"    Colin Jones, 74, met girlfriend Pauline Young, 72, in 1976 and they fell in love \u0027hook, line and sinker\u0027.

Colin met Pauline in the South East in 1976 when their children from previous relationships went to the same playgroupHer diagnosis also saw the couple pack up and move to Gozo, Malta, 14 years ago for a different pace of life and they ran a bed and breakfast on the island together.But three years ago they made the difficult decision for Pauline to come back to England after her condition worsened.Carers initially tended to Pauline at her daughter\u0027s home, but three years ago she moved into St George\u0027s Park Nursing Home in Telford.With their business still to run, Colin now splits his time between Gozo and the nursing home in Telford, where he visits Pauline every several weeks.

Month of mad hares and parted ways. Maybe, after all, 29 March will come and go and Britain will still be in the EU by parliamentary vote and, who knows, a delay could produce a second referendum. But as things stand, this is officially the last month of Britain belonging to the community of European nations. And a sad exhibition at one London gallery muses on the miserable stupidity of it all.Should I Stay Or Should I Go? at Patrick Heide Contemporary Art is not a homage to the Clash song but an urgent personal question for Europeans living in Britain. And for some Britons, too. Gallerist Heide admits it’s one he asks himself. Like many artists and art professionals in London, he is from continental Europe – in his case Frankfurt – and his exhibition reflects the wretched sense that everything is going to be different, that Britain is shrinking. Susan Stockwell’s green woollen map of Britain shows this most succinctly. Scotland looks proper and correct, yet Brexit-voting England and Wales are collapsing in a shapeless mess. Brexit is not strengthening national identity in this acidic knit but melting this sceptred isle.When Polish artist Michal Iwanowski, who lives in Cardiff, came across the words “Go home Polish” daubed in his neighbourhood, he took a photograph and brooded. After the EU referendum he decided to take the advice and set out on a walk from Cardiff to Poland, photographing and noting what he saw from the green fields he tramped across to the barbed wire fences he observed at Calais.It is all quite low-key, perhaps because for now the battle seems lost. Britain is leaving Europe. It’s a moment when despair is understandable. Only a lunatic could be upbeat about the prospects for a happy outcome right now. Michael Landy laments this rancid reality in a group of small red and white paintings. One of them shows a Brexit fantasy of rustic Britain lit by a new dawn. Next to it a man is pissing to show the artist’s true feelings. Another image shows a swimmer not waving, but drowning. These gnomic foretellings of national disaster capture the sheer idiocy of our predicament.Moronic inferno it may be, but Brexit has made us aware we’re living in history. No doubt about it, March 2019 will be in the history books along with the outbreaks of civil war in 1642 and world conflict in July 1914. History paintings can preserve and monumentalise such mighty and heroic hours. Another London gallery, Ransom Art, is currently showing a crazed satirical history painting by John Springs called Mustn’t Grumble, that portrays the political establishment as a bunch of grotesques out of Gillray or Hogarth on a flag-bedecked Brexit train to nowhere. To be honest, I can’t even tell which side the artist is on, but it certainly appeals to my sense of alienation from the political system that got us here.Yet as we hurtle towards the edge and prepare to fall off the map of Europe, these protests – or wretched ruminations on the folly of it all – are mere blips in what remains, at this moment, a British art world comprehensively plugged into Europe. You would be forgiven for thinking the web that connects the British and continental art worlds is too complex and entangled ever to be really broken. Yet immigration from the EU is falling, and artists are among the most joyously migrant of communities.Maybe the moment this unhomely March truly resembles is the “phoney war” period at the beginning of the second world war, when no one really knew how events would develop. It is an unreal feeling. We’re about to sever our connection with our continent – brutally at worst, pointlessly at best – yet it feels unreal because the flow of modern life seems unstoppable.British artist Joe Sweeney captures the imminent tragedy of this infamous month in a public artwork that goes live today. +44 ...

Collectively the claimants, who gave talks for school tours and members of the public, had 500 years’ experience working for the gallery one inidual had been with the institution for 45 years.The National Gallery argued that the claimants were self-employed, but the employment tribunal judge said that “it is unreal to describe the dealings between the parties as transactions in which the gallery stood as the ‘client or customer of any business undertaking’ carried on by any of the lead claimants”.One of the claimants, Karly Allen, who worked for the gallery for 18 years, said: “This judgment cannot take away the fact that we have lost our jobs and the close relationship with the gallery which we loved it does go some way to acknowledge the losses we have suffered and our contribution to the life of the gallery.”Marie van der Zyl, a partner at law firm Ince Gordon Dadds, which represented the claimants, said: “This is an important case for all those who have unconventional working arrangements. The world of work is changing and there will be many iniduals who are unsure of their status and rights. This case gives those iniduals hope.”Adam Ohringer, a barrister specialising in employment cases at Cloisters chambers, said: “We have become accustomed to private employers denying workers their legal rights. This is a wake-up call to the public sector and, I am sure, the first of many cases in which public bodies will be challenged over the misclassification of their staff and the circumvention of employment rights.”“The gallery had no wish to get involved in litigation in relation to this matter. From the outset we would have welcomed the opportunity to resolve the issue through mediation, but the claimants did not respond to the Gallery’s requests to enable these discussions to begin since the claim arose.‘The Gallery has not ‘dismissed’ anyone as part of this process. The majority of the people involved are still providing these services to us on the same basis as previously, whilst others involved in these claims have already accepted either employment or new contracts with us.“It is important to state that this case should not be likened to the ‘gig economy’ debate that has been in the news recently, with legal cases brought against Hermes, Uber and Deliveroo. In fact, the National Gallery situation is exactly the opposite.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ab2efae0691132a2cd90e5557da2c41e0e42b4/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cae2d12967aa428293874f9d03c86210","title":"david marr on the extraordinary rise of george pell the reckoning podcast","story":"Now that George Pell has been found guilty of child sexual abuse, we can ask ourselves: what does his story tell us about the Catholic church?

He had been told by the government he would be eligible to travel again two years after being released from Guantánamo. Slahi is supported by almost 200 writers, editors, publishers, teachers and human-rights advocates, who have written to Ould-Abdallah describing the rejection as “extrajudicial punishment of a man who has never engaged in terrorism nor ever been charged with or convicted of a crime”.Slahi was held at Guantánamo without charge between August 2002 and October 2016. He had fought alongside men who would join al-Qaida in the Afghanistan insurrection, but says he renounced the group in the 1990s. He turned himself in for questioning in Mauritania after the 911 attacks, and was subsequently rendered to Jordan, Afghanistan and then to Guantánamo Bay. His memoir about that time, Guantánamo Diary, details the torture he underwent, including isolation, beatings, sexual humiliation, death threats, and a mock kidnapping. It has been published in 29 countries and 26 languages, and was longlisted for the UK’s leading non-fiction award, the Samuel Johnson prize.Slahi was released in 2016 after 14 years in the detention centre, and transferred to Mauritania.The rejection of his recent application, however, prompted him to go public. The petition and attached letter of support is “a warning to the government. If you don’t give me my papers, I’m going to court,” he said. “They were very clear about it. They said the United States government asked them not to. I go to the United States, they said: ‘You are not a citizen, you are not in Guantánamo Bay. It is up to your country.’”The Mauritanian embassy in London did not respond to a request for comment. “It just demonstrates how arbitrary and absurd the restrictions are,” said Larry Siems, the author and human rights advocate who edited Guantánamo Diary. “People who know him best and know his situation understand how grossly unjust it is that he continues to be punished for nothing, and the international support from the letter shows he is reaching people … He appears frequently for classroom discussions by Skype around the world. He’s reached hearts and minds of students and faculty around the world. We live in this globalised world and those exchanges have all been incredibly positive, and there’s no reason to try to interrupt or impede them.”The letter describes the urgency of Slahi’s need for a passport, with doctors in Mauritania, the US and Germany stating that Slahi “requires advanced medical treatment for conditions associated with his ordeal of detention and abuse”, with one German doctor willing to “oversee and cover all costs associated with his treatment”.Slahi’s supporters in the petition described him as “an important international voice for justice, peace, reconciliation and faith” despite “the litany of injustices and human rights abuses” he has endured.The letter adds: “It is time to restore his freedom to travel so that he may enjoy his rights as a Mauritanian and fully represent his country and his values to the world … He is not just an important literary voice he is also an inspirational public figure who projects the essential human values of dignity, grace, peace, family, tolerance, faith and community. Authorising Mr Slahi’s freedom to travel will facilitate mutual respect and understanding across cultures, and enhance international appreciation of your country and its rich cultural heritage.”Slahi said that he has “so many people supporting me, but none of them can make decisions … It’s very dangerous. I’m exposed, very exposed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d297bea87f9134073239305f0493b88c296d6e49/0_0_5130_2754/master/5130.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af9f7cfb52b40e6c21ffa9c8a90a3bc4 660w","title":"a powerful argument for radical change readers respond to guardian concrete week","story":"From highlighting favourite Brutalist gems to suggesting construction alternatives, readers have had lots to say about our concrete coverageThis week  Cities has been investigating the contentious issue of concrete. While it has brought about improvements in public health and some celebrated works of architecture, the material is causing widespread destruction across the globe.As our coverage explored concrete’s different angles – its environmental impact, its influence on culture, the brutalist buildings under threat, and potential alternative materials – many of you joined in the debate.We were overwhelmed by your response, from photos of your favourite concrete beauties and detested monstrosities, to tales of how concrete has shaped your cities, such as this Instagram post from the Birmingham Civic Society about the legacy of its “concrete collar”.On Twitter there was an impassioned debate over whether the demolition of Birmingham’s old Central Library – a former brutalist landmark – was architectural vandalism or the right decision for the city.You also expressed alarm at the dangers that the production and use of concrete is posing to the planet, and several of you, inspired by Fiona Harvey’s report on alternatives to concrete, shared examples of more environmentally friendly materials and methods.Jonathan Watts, the ’s Environment editor, kicked off our Concrete Week with an in-depth report on the shocking impact of concrete on the planet. Here’s a selection of your many responses to his report:Fiona Harvey reported on the new alternatives to concrete being developed, such as cross-laminated timber. David Hopkins, managing director of the Timber Trade Federation, got in touch to reiterate the benefits of wood: “There are lots of advantages to building in timber – managed forests provide a range of environmental benefits, helping to produce oxygen, provide bioerse habitats and natural management of water, reducing flood risk. As a material that absorbs rather than emits carbon, timber continues to make a positive contribution to the environment after it is harvested, and has one of the smallest carbon footprints of any material used for building.”Other readers told us about other potential solutions we’d missed. Hemp – perhaps not commonly associated with the construction industry – has long been celebrated as an alternative building and insulation material. “Hempcrete” is made with a mix of hemp hurds, lime and water, and is used mainly for non-structural building materials and wall insulation. Once the plant is turned into hempcrete it continues to absorb CO2.Straw is another option. Straw Works, for example, manufactures pre-fabricated straw panels. The company says: “Load bearing walls are either built of load bearing straw bales, or timber frame infilled with straw.” As an alternative to concrete foundations it is also using car tyres for the new community hall by Holy Trinity Church in Tulse Hill, London.We also heard about Gnanli Landrou, a scientist and entrepreneur, who is developing a process to turn clay-based excavation material into a soil-based concrete, which doesn’t use cement – the key material that is most responsible for concrete’s shocking carbon footprint.You contacted us to tell us about cement companies that are attempting to make the production process less harmful to the environment. The manufacture of clinker is the most-energy intensive part of cement production, with half of concrete’s CO2 emissions created during this process. Dalmia Cement, Ambuja Cement and UltraTech Cement in India say they are trying to change the way they produce clinker, and are using recycled industrial waste. They use low-grade limestone, with fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and slag (waste from the steel industry) in their blended cements.One reader on Twitter also said:Structural engineer Nawid Daoud, meanwhile, argued that – although he supports sustainable alternative materials – some elements of construction can’t be done using sustainable, commercially viable alternatives (yet). He says for certain components of buildings, concrete is still the most viable option both from a material strength perspective, and from a cost perspective.For example, the vast majority of building foundations are concrete, and you will struggle to find an alternative, more sustainable material which will perform in the same way as concrete does under intense compression, let alone one which is widely available (and therefore affordable).”You took to Instagram to post concrete-inspired photos, and wrote about your affection for certain concrete structures.Mark Cowan from UK Truckmixer Training got in touch to flag up the importance of training for drivers who deliver concrete. Cowan, who has worked as a concrete mixer driver for 28 years, says these vehicles are frequently subject to rollover incidents.… we received this photo of concrete hippos in Glenrothes, Fife.Thanks to all of you who submitted comments, emails, tweets, posts and images. We looked at each one, and although we couldn’t include them all we were hugely heartened by your passion and knowledge.

However, murga – a feisty, home-grown form of street dance and percussion performed during carnival season, once unfairly thought of as only performed by drop-outs and drunks – has flourished in recent years, providing a source of pride, happiness and salvation for the predominantly working class families that dedicate their lives to it.One of the capital’s approximately 100 official groups, La Locura de Boedo (the craziness of Boedo), invited me to tour the city with them 10 years ago while working on a newspaper assignment. I have been following their fortunes through carnival seasons ever since, travelling with the troupe on beaten up school buses to parades in far flung barrios across the city – unpretentious affairs in which street corners house makeshift scaffold stages.The carnival takes place during the humid summer months when the city’s well-off residents tend to relocate to the coast. Local children, many of whom can’t afford holidays away, peer transfixed through railings, in search of a different kind of escape, as their local idols fling their arms around and dance in a rapturous series of acrobatic kicks, to the hypnotic, thunderous beat of bass drums and cymbals.Like Rio’s Samba, Salvador’s Axe and Andean Carnavalito, murga’s roots reflect the cultural melting pot of Argentina’s colonial past, nodding back to the shores of Europe and Africa. The art form was repressed during the dictatorship of 1976-83, but went on to flourish during the 1990s among predominantly working class families, with the number of groups increasing more than tenfold.Over time I learned that behind the spectacle of the parades, murga is a powerful social force shaping people’s identities and providing a support network rooted in the local neighbourhood. It gives people a sense of pride, an outlet for collective creativity and an escape from everyday struggles.“Through the murga you give a hand to whoever needs it,” says Juanjo, the charismatic director who runs the troupe with his wife Monica and their two sons, Maxi and Jony. “You try to contain the kids on the street, get them out of drugs and put them within this circle, which is the most beautiful thing there is.”In the lead up to carnival, Juanjo and Monica’s humble grey-cement house is a hive of activity, as murgueros of all ages gather to put the finishing touches to brightly coloured satin suits, put on shimmering make up in their group colours of red, white and turquoise, and assemble the distinctive bass drums with brass cymbals on top that anchor the murga’s percussion.During weekdays, the troupe are taxi drivers, receptionists, pest controllers, teachers, cleaners, plumbers and students, many struggling under the weight of Argentina’s worsening economic situation, which has recently seen a dramatic currency devaluation and soaring food and utility prices.But on Saturday and Sunday nights they leave their troubles behind and transform into glittering performers, with coat tails weighed down by appliques made of thousands of beads they have painstakingly sewn by hand over months.Juanjo, Monica, Maxi and Jony’s decision to dedicate themselves to murga came in an attempt to take their minds off their sadness after Juanjo and Monica’s youngest son died of meningitis in 1995 at the age of two. Now the group feels like a giant family. The directors are looked at by many in the 200-strong group as parental figures. “The role that my father left, he (Juanjo) took on,” says dancer Makiú.Like many group members, Makiú met her partner through murga, and the couple made their three children tiny suits for carnival not long after they were born, carrying them through the parade in their arms until they were old enough to dance and play the drums.Murga still bears the scars of historical marginalisation, with many in Argentine society continuing to associate it with transgression and delinquency. However, in 1997, the activity of murga groups was given ‘“cultural heritage” status by the City of Buenos Aires, and in 2011 former president Cristina de Kirchner re-instated the two-day carnival public holiday that had been taken away during the dictatorship, supporting murga’s transition into a family friendly, more mainstream activity.Despite this, there are few adverts for the carnival in the local media, so the parades remain largely undiscovered by tourists and even many city residents. For those that come to watch and take part in it, however, murga has long been an empowering force against the mixed fortunes of their everyday lives.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db262009840e17da51a32c3242a88e739d6265c8/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcfa31443a9aa3f8dfce7a8659a3e5b5","title":"were wholly disappointed the industry responds to guardian concrete week","story":"This week  Cities has focused on the huge impact of concrete on the modern world. Here is some of the industry’s responseThis week  Cities is investigating the impact of concrete, revealing the terrible destruction it causes to the planet:• Concrete in cities exacerbates flooding that kills thousands of people every year.• Its dust can be toxic.• It contributes to the heat island effect, raising temperatures in some already dangerously hot cities.• It requires huge amounts of a kind of sand that is short supply, damaging natural environments, and that is mined under often deadly circumstances by “sand mafias”.• If the concrete industry were a country, it would be the third worst emitter of CO2 after China and the US.To round out our coverage, we also published articles about the history of concrete, including its use in Roman times and now in 3D printing its popularity in architecture its social history its use in modern day China and postwar Italy and many of the various alternatives and innovations currently being developed.And we called for engagement and action from the industry.Several industry figures did respond to our coverage.In an email, the Global Cement and Concrete Association said they were “wholly disappointed” not to have been consulted on “the thrust of the articles”. In a statement on their website, the association responded further:’s ‘Concrete Week’ is a great opportunity to look at a range of important issues associated with concrete, and it is right to examine some of the important challenges the world faces. However, inadequately covering the significant work already underway by the sector, as well as underplaying concrete’s critical benefits, gives an incomplete picture.We recognise there are challenges in cement and concrete production and have been working hard over many years to find solutions. There are some important innovations already underway and by collaborating with partners in the built environment we can make an important contribution to reducing global emissions. We are fully committed to continuing to take climate action and to move towards a sustainable future.Concrete’s contribution to society over its whole life should always be considered. It has many important benefits such as its ability to reabsorb CO2 from the atmosphere, as well as its thermal mass properties which means that it can reduce the energy needs of buildings.Only putting across one side of the debate is narrow and fails to address the realities of the needs of a significantly growing global population and increasing urbanisation. Safe homes and buildings, clean water and resilient infrastructure will be needed in the future world – all of which concrete can provide.”Other industry figures tweeted. Several of them claimed that, rather than contributing to climate change, concrete is actually “part of the solution”.Others said they were “disappointed” in us and were “looking forward to positive stories” about concrete.

But any extension of article 50 raises big issues that would take months to sort outFor two long years, Theresa May always insisted that Britain will leave the European Union on 29 March. So determined has she been to deliver Brexit by this self-imposed deadline that she has even had the date written into law. This week, she made an uncharacteristic bow to political reality and accepted that it may not happen after all. This was a pivotal concession and a watershed moment in Britain’s argument about Brexit.Mrs May’s statement on Tuesday should be read with care. It was hedged with conditions. She continues to pursue her original timetable. Her own deal – possibly slightly tweaked from the version that MPs threw out in January – would have to be defeated on 12 March for any delay to Brexit to be triggered. Parliament would also have to vote – again – against leaving the EU with no deal. If both these things happen, and both currently appear likely, the government will then put forward a motion to MPs for “a short limited extension” to the article 50 process. Mrs May made it clear that she will oppose any extension beyond the end of June 2019.The prime minister’s willingness to allow an extension is a welcome development. It had to be forced out of her by some equally welcome tough action by a group of cabinet ministers. But the terms in which she might approach any extension of article 50 remain unrealistic. She needs to be much clearer – with herself and the country – what she would use the extension for.Based on what she said this week, she appears to hope she can use an extension to get yet another variant of her existing deal over the line. But there is very little negotiating space for that. The EU is not willing to change the withdrawal agreement. Her hardline leavers are not willing to bend the knee and accept it. If she sticks to the strategy of making meaningless tweaks to her deal to make it acceptable to hardline leavers, we could arrive at the end of June in exactly the same mess as now. Mrs May therefore needs to recognise another truth. A delay will not mean business as usual. It will mean a rethink. This is why the agriculture minister, George Eustice, resigned over the issue on Thursday.Such a rethink could take several different forms. She could try for a softer Brexit deal, perhaps involving customs and single market alignment along European Free Trade Association terms. She could commit to lock Britain into a customs union. She could offer an early general election in return for votes for a changed deal or accept a second referendum in exchange for support for her deal in the way that Labour appears to be contemplating. She could embark on a deliberative democratic exercise to seek out public consensus.Any of these, or any combination, would involve reaching out to different interests and large changes of approach. That process necessitates new thinking. Mrs May is not a natural new thinker. But there is no alternative to trying. Her existing Brexit policy has failed. It will have to be replaced by a better policy that commands wider support. This will need time. Not unlimited time. But probably more than three months, especially if the outcome is ultimately to be put to the voters in an election or another referendum. All this suggests an extension of at least six months, and maybe more. The lesson of the current impasse is precisely that we cannot again let the clock prevent Britain from sorting Brexit out.Mrs May told MPs this week that no extension can go beyond June because that would mean the UK taking part in the European parliament elections in late May. That would be a problem if the Brexit outcome was settled. But it isn’t – that’s the whole point. Mrs May should get her priorities straight. The elections are awkwardly timed but it is silly not to take part. The priority of getting this national emergency resolved properly is worth the price of having British MEPs in place while it is being sorted.Election campaigning may even be useful at a dark time. Britain is in the midst of a deep national argument about future relations with Europe. Why not open that argument to the people? For once, the European elections might actually be about Europe. Britain should certainly make clear that, if Brexit is agreed, our MEPs would withdraw. In the meantime, Britain loses nothing by taking part. Let’s vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af50bb451666021a020faa8ba9b5d97d625b7d61/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fabbaea9d2974e869b03b5680faa2cdc","title":"freak weatherfebruary heat apocalypse climate change","story":"There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat, wind, rain or snow. Unless you were at sea in a gale, fear was a rare emotion. Even in 1987, when the so-called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid-October, it was possible to be more awed than afraid. Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people, but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind’s strength – “Would you just listen to that!” – rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible. Thirty-odd years later, most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong.In England, the wind gusted at 120mph that night, and at least 22 people were killed on both sides of the Channel. But unless you were among the bereaved, or had a tall oak fall through the roof, nobody felt anxiety or despair. There was no prevailing gloom.The writer Jonathan Raban witnessed the scene in Hyde Park, where small crowds had gathered around the gaping craters left by uprooted trees, and buzzsaws made the park “as noisy as a logging camp”. Raban noted a popular reaction. “It’s so sad, people said, trying to quench their smiles – for they didn’t feel sad at all,” he wrote. “They were thrilled by the magnificent destruction of the wind: it was as if the world itself had come tumbling down, and even the shyest, most pacific people in the crowd felt some answering chord of violence in their own natures respond to this tremendous and unlooked-for act of violence in nature itself.”That seemed true to me. As a child, lying late in bed on a Saturday morning, I would imagine that the bedstead had electric-powered wheels and could be driven anywhere in any weather, while I lay snug with a hot-water bottle under a waterproof quilt, steering the bedstead into gales and downpours. Growing up beside the sea, I could repeat this juxtaposition of comfort and danger by nestling on a stormy afternoon in a little hollow above the shore to watch the big, grey waves smash over the rocks as if they had taken against them. From a vantage point that was safe and relatively warm, the weather presented itself as an entertainment.Sometimes, clearly, it was more than that. In 1953, looking out from our living room on a rolling sea, I heard adults speak gravely about how the same storm had sunk the ferry Princess Victoria on its passage to Northern Ireland, with the loss of 133 passengers and crew. And in January 1968 a stronger and even more damaging wind than the Great Storm of 1987 tore west to east across Scotland, leaving 20 people dead and several hundred homeless.Working a late shift on a Glasgow newspaper that night, I thought I saw the glass in the office windows bend inwards before it broke a scene that might belong to the Book of Revelation (“And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail…”). But as the idea of a punitive God had died long ago, even on a Presbyterian paper such as the Scottish , weather was left as a series of random events unconnected to any human activity.Still, tentative connections were being made. By the early 1960s, scientists knew beyond doubt that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were rising there was, or could be, a “greenhouse effect”. In 1975 the geophysicist Wallace Broecker popularised the phrase “global warming”, at least among the scientific community, when he included it in the title of an academic paper. It was only in 1988, however, that it began to be seen as a pressing global concern – thanks largely to the testimony of the climatologist James Hansen before a US Senate committee, the formation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the work of the writer Bill McKibben, whose book The End of Nature, published in 1989, was an early primer to climate change’s likely effects.The 30 years since have been lived out in a kind of denial: not in terms of international conferences and demonstrations, or the growth in renewable energy and the search for the perfect electric car, but in our apparent belief that nothing fundamental will change. McKibben wrote in Granta magazine in 2003 that people still thought about global warming “in the way they think about ‘violence on television’ or ‘growing trade deficits’, as a marginal concern to them, if a concern at all … hardly anyone has fear in their guts”.How can we live with this prospect and not go mad? The website of Extinction Rebellion, which aims to change government attitudes to climate breakdown through nonviolent resistance, carries a film, Heading for Extinction and What to Do About It, which is one of the plainest bits of film-making you will ever see. A female scientist stands in what looks to be her modest kitchen and talks for an hour to a small audience (never in shot) about human civilisation’s probable fate. “Traditionally, you try to be a bit hopeful,” she says at the beginning, “but this is a different kind of talk.” What we need, she says, isn’t hope but courage. We’re heading towards three degrees of warming, and that will be catastrophic, “like boarding a plane that has a one in 20 chance of a crash”.Halfway through her talk, she allows her audience two minutes to grieve for our future losses. Then she invites us to act – to modify the future terror through present acts of peaceful protest. Is it really worth trying? That, she says, is the wrong question. We must act out of “a desire to be a worthy ancestor”.When Raban visited Hyde Park in 1987 to look at the fallen trees, none of that speech was imaginable. We had then, and for some time after, yet to feel fear in our guts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3190c749acaa1807f78fd7cf1645ceab5616c6/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5e246af2e68cab3c42402c767b4417a","title":"oakland teacher strike tentative deal reached","story":"The city’s 3,000 teachers walked off the job to demand higher pay, smaller classes and more school resourcesStriking teachers in Oakland, California, reached a contract agreement Friday with district officials to end a week-long walkout.The deal, reached on the strike’s seventh day, still needs to be voted on by teachers. They were expected to vote Saturday, and, if the deal is approved, return to classrooms next week.“On Monday, March 4, we look forward to everyone being together again in the classroom,” Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell said in a statement. “The contract will help ensure more teachers stay in Oakland and that more come to teach in our classrooms and support our students.”Oakland’s teachers walked off the job 21 February to demand higher pay, smaller class sizes and more school resources.Union officials from the Oakland Education Association said in a statement Friday that the contract deal marked “a win in every major proposal” the union made.Teachers are expected to vote on the agreement this weekend, the statement said.The city’s 86 schools were open during the strike, staffed by a skeleton crew of substitutes and administrators, but most students stayed away in support of their striking teachers.The Oakland Education Association said educators were forced to strike because administrators had not listened to their demands for two years. Teachers had been working without a contract since 2017.A starting salary for teachers at Oakland schools is $46,500 a year and the average salary in the district is $63,000 a year.The union also called for the district to scrap plans to close as many as 24 schools that serve primarily African American and Latino students. It fears more students will be lost to charter schools that drain more than $57m a year from the district.As part of the deal, there will be a five-month pause on any school closures, the union said.The talks did not center on pension or healthcare benefits, which are free for full-time workers and their beneficiaries. The Oakland district spends an additional $13,487 per teacher annually for health benefits for educators and their families.Oakland teachers were the latest educators in the country to strike over pay and classroom conditions.Recent strikes across the nation have built on a wave of teacher activism that began last spring. Unions for West Virginia teachers, who staged a nine-day walkout last year, ended another two-day strike last week.Last month, teachers in Denver ended a three-day walkout after reaching a deal raising their wages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f12a385000e77ae123d86398d2932979929d063/0_372_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4471d34aa76e903681c6b720a97f0ecd","title":"surge in demand for schools leaves councils struggling to cope","story":"Thousands of pupils in England denied place at their preferred secondary schoolCouncils across England are struggling to keep pace with rising numbers of applications for secondary school, leaving thousands of pupils without a place at any of their preferred schools.More than 600,000 families across England and Wales were told on Friday which secondary school their children would go to in September – but in many areas there was disappointment, with shrinking proportions receiving their first choice.According to some estimates, as many as one in four families did not get their first preference in England. Labour blamed the government policies that took the power to create new schools away from local authorities.The problem appeared most acute in London, the south-east and other big cities such as Bristol and Birmingham, where the twin impacts of the post-2006 baby boom and population inflows have been most keenly felt.Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, said: “This government is determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created 825,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.”But Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said: “In the years ahead, more and more children will miss out on a secondary school place unless we urgently provide new places across the country. The Tories have made it harder for councils to act on their legal obligation to provide new school places, with an inefficient free schools programme making it harder for them to create new places where they are needed.”In Greater London, less than two-thirds of children received their first preference of school as the total number of applications rose again. This year 95,300 requests for places were received by the 33 London boroughs, compared with about 80,000 five years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3711638b13c0b797cf2d24c2ea4a9449dd352d47/0_0_2444_1466/master/2444.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c12103871b71e067d72360ca571b861f 660w","title":"paris fashion week hedi slimane raises the roof with timeless chic","story":"Designer’s autumnwinter show for Celine eschews bare skin for classic linesPolitics are the new hemlines at fashion week. After triggering a firestorm of feminist anger with the bare-skin-and-teen aesthetic of his first collection for Celine, designer Hedi Slimane followed up with a move of radical unpredictability. His second Celine collection at Paris fashion week, shown on Friday, gave his audience the one thing they didn’t expect – namely, what they’d hoped for.Slimane’s riposte to accusations of commodifying women’s sexuality is about as robust as it gets in fashion: this season, he is really into tweed culottes. Six months ago, his vision for the house of Celine centred on rollerskating skinny teens in tiny party dresses, mostly strapless, almost all micro-mini. Of the 59 looks of his sophomore show in the Hotel des Invalides, only one – a long silk dress with a deep V-neck, worn under a heavy sheepskin gilet – showed even an inch of skin below the neck. The rest of the show consisted of trousers or below-the-knee skirts worn over slouchy boots, paired with sweaters and high-necked blouses.It was a shockingly bourgeois vision from fashion’s self-proclaimed king of rock’n’roll. Pie-crust blouses were layered under preppy crew neck sweaters the hemlines of pleated skirts swished over wearable wedge-heel boots. It was also a commercial home run. This chic, upscale-Saint-Germain French-girl aesthetic never goes out of fashion. Saddlebags and pie-crust blouses, scarf-print silks and tweed blazers, Aviator sunglasses and knee-high boots will sell like hot cakes.The show began in Slimane’s customary grandstanding fashion, with the first model lowered on to the catwalk on a mirrored that which floated to Earth at a shallow angle, like a gondola lift on a ski run. The flashbulbs kept popping, and it was only when she stepped on to the catwalk and away from the flashing lights that the shock of long, pleated culottes worn with a high-necked blouse, foulard, blazer and boots dawned on an audience that had been braced for party frocks coloured and sized like Quality Street wrappers. The entire collection was provocatively conservative: tweed coats, jeans tucked into boots, mid-sized handbags. If Slimane’s purpose was to make Celine into fashion week’s appointment-viewing drama, this show was a triumph. After such a cliffhanger, the audience are already talking about the next series. If, on the other hand, his purpose is to give Celine an identity, a new set of house codes, then the jury is still out.The tweed coats, silk dresses, wedge boots and saddlebags were all deeply desirable, but they belonged to a school of chic already well served by other French fashion labels. The trademark of Phoebe Philo’s Celine was an elegance that was very slightly, but unmissably, off centre. This was middle of the road. The Celine heritage to which this collection referred was perhaps closer to the American sportswear-tinted jet-set luxury of the Michael Kors years of 1997-2004 than to Philo’s era.The repositioning of Celine began during awards season. Observers of red carpet optics noted that Slimane, who moved from Paris to Los Angeles in 2008, was choosing to dress actors with a mature, outspoken presence rather than clothes-hanger starlets. A dress first seen at Paris fashion week with a micro-mini hemline was remade as a floor-length gown before it was worn by Rachel Weisz for the Golden Globes in January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1fa4ee4ef1923b020e354d76059b3fd8bb3efe/0_2395_4032_2418/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b49098bd8628c0d5f270484887b5c368","title":"how to work the spring green look in pictures","story":"Emerald, lime and mint are all good to go this season: wear head to toe or pick an accent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

She arrived at Gare du Nord in time to catch her train from Paris to London, but when she got there, she realised she had left her passport at home. She has just moved, she explains, to a new place in Paris, the city in which she has lived for decades, and nothing is where she expects it to be.“When you move, it’s quite disorienting. You don’t quite know where you are.” Not that she is in any way ruffled by the train fiasco. It is hard to imagine her being ruffled by anything. She needs a minute to put her bags down, she says, as she checks in at the hotel, then I should come up to her room and we can talk. She puts on her sunglasses and disappears into the lift.Rampling is 73, riding the crest of another wave of an extraordinary career. She is in the UK to talk about her latest film, Hannah, in which she plays a woman whose husband goes to prison for an unspecified but clearly terrible crime. We watch as her life begins to crack around her, but largely, that is it. It is so sparse that it makes the gorgeous 45 Years, for which she received her only Oscar nomination in 2016, look as action-packed as an Avengers movie.Hannah’s director, Andrea Pallaoro, had always imagined Rampling in the part, and no wonder. “I think he wanted, more than anything, a presence,” she says. “He thought I was the only actress of my generation that could really hold this character.” There is barely any dialogue, and it goes through the monotony of Hannah’s days in painstaking detail. Everything hangs on Rampling’s face, her familiar heavy eyelids and downturned mouth, showing horrors but not speaking them. With this and 45 Years, she says, she is finally making the kind of films she has always wanted to make.In her hotel room, she pulls an armchair around to face mine, folds her arms, and sits forward, legs apart, as if she means business. She looks out of the window, or off to the side, until she catches a thought, then turns those eyes to look at me. She speaks slowly and thoughtfully, and often pauses as she considers where she’s going with what she’s about to say.She has just returned from Berlin, where she received the Honorary Golden Bear award, a lifetime achievement affair. When she gets something like that, she always wonders if she has really earned it. “My career has been sort of marginal,” she says. “I’ve always thought of it as something that’s not really in the big time.”That may be so, to her mind, but Rampling has been in the public eye since the 60s. She was plucked from the secretarial pool as a teenager by an executive on the floor above who thought she looked pretty and asked her to appear in a Cadbury’s advert. She never quite felt comfortable in that world and thought she wasn’t very good at what she was doing.“It was too show-off for me, acting. It didn’t suit my personality, either,” she says. Nevertheless, she made the most of the swinging excitement in the air. Her breakthrough came as the pregnant and furious Meredith in Georgy Girl. “For a few years there was a wonderful innocence. We had money, we had jobs, people were making a fortune with clothes, and it was as if it was happening by magic, really.”Then, in 1966, when Rampling was 20, her sister, Sarah, killed herself. “After she died, I was obviously looking at life in a very different way. You go more underground, in a sense. You go into a certain form of darkness. You have to, because it’s just so weird, what you’re living, when somebody does what my sister did.” Everything had changed. She travelled to Afghanistan, and lived in a Tibetan monastery for a while. “It wasn’t only me, although my reasons for it were heightened. We were all searching for alternative ways of being and alternative ways of understanding the world we were in, trying to be much more together and spiritual, and less grabbing, less business.” She made a conscious decision not to lose herself in drink or in drugs. “I said: that’s going to send me completely out of my head, where I’ve got to remain in my head and in my body.”It can be easy to look back on Rampling’s career as a series of provocations. She never seems to flinch at sex or nudity. Her most infamous role, in Liliana Cavani’s The Night Porter, about the sadomasochistic relationship between an SS officer and a concentration camp survivor, was received with dismay by many critics, and banned in some countries. Was she trying to be provocative, or seeking out dangerous parts? “I think the danger is within me,” she says. “It’s always provocation, or daring, or wanting to ignite things, or wanting to make things live. Not just to repeat scenes.“Another thing about acting is that I got bored very quickly. I’ve got a very, very restless character … It’s a beast.” Does she know where it comes from? “It’s in my DNA,” she smiles.Depression stopped her working in the late 80s and much of the 90s. “It’s the reverse of you, the depression. You’ve got to start almost from zero, because you’re just dead to the world ... your desire for anything, everything’s gone. You’ve got to build yourself up again.” These days, she keeps a close eye on how she’s feeling. “If you have that form of sensitivity, where you can go up and down quite a lot, you have to be attentive about that. Because coming through a very big depression, you really, really know how to do things for yourself better, so that you can carry on.”On the surface, it seems as if she has been relentlessly busy since she started working again. She even returned to Hollywood, for a part in the TV series Dexter (she stayed at the Chateau Marmont, the most European hotel she could find) and in the Jennifer Lawrence blockbuster Red Sparrow, although she points out that she only had to go to Budapest to shoot it and didn’t set a foot in Los Angeles. Around the time of Red Sparrow, she says, she experienced something new. “I felt this strength I hadn’t ever felt in my life. I’ve been able to surf on that for quite a while. Whether it’s because getting older is easier, I don’t know. But I know that in my case, I had never felt, in that way, strong, capable, able to do it, no problem.”When she picked up the Golden Bear, Rampling said that Hannah and 45 Years were the films she had been working towards, “a coming-home of what I wanted to do in cinema, that form of expressionism. The kind of presence given to a character is what I always wanted to achieve. So I can say now that has happened, and that’s very beautiful.”It has been a long process, she says. “Not that I’ve studied all my work, which I could possibly do when I’m really an old lady, but there’s definitely an essence of it in there, somewhere. It’s a life’s work, in a sense.”It is rare to find a mention of Rampling that does not refer to her credentials as a muse. She has been a muse to François Ozon, who revived her film career in the late 90s, to designer Yves St Laurent and photographers Helmut Newton and Juergen Teller (posing nude for the latter in front of the Mona Lisa), and now to Andrea Pallaoro, too. Given that her career has, in its own right, been extraordinary, I wonder how she feels about the idea of being a muse. “Is it sort of now not acceptable?” she asks. “Are we being used if we’re a muse?” she hams, dragging out the vowels. “I think it’s a question of age, because when you’re much younger, you could be. She says that when Ozon came along, she was in her early 50s, and when Pallaoro sought her out, she was in her late 60s. “When it’s that way around, there’s something very beautiful about it. They just want to film an older woman. Especially for something like Hannah, a woman on the verge of having to handle all these very very difficult situations and emotional challenges.”At the Rotterdam film festival in January, Rampling declined to talk about #MeToo, saying she was wary of being misinterpreted. Does she still feel that way? She takes a moment to think. “What would you want to know?” Given her experience of the industry, from arthouse to Hollywood, from being at the heart of it in the 60s to where she is now, it would be interesting to know what she has made of it all. There is a longer silence. “It’s a vast subject, actually. I’d rather not go there.” Then she appears to be reconsidering. “It’s a very, very important one. I mean, I’m thinking, what would I say? It’s so vast.”In 2016, Rampling was nominated for her first Academy award, best actress, for 45 Years. Around that time, she gave an interview to a French radio station and said that the ersity row over that year’s all-white shortlist was “racist to white people”. It caused an outcry, and she subsequently apologised, saying her comments had been misinterpreted. “I had lost my husband, my companion for 20 years, just three months before,” she says, today. She had been engaged to Jean-Noël Tassez for 18 years he died of cancer in 2015. “There were a lot of interviews going on and I was so unbelievably happy about what was happening with the film, because it was suddenly so loved. I felt supported by it. She was a current affairs journalist, whamming it, and I sort of batted it away. Suddenly, just ...” She claps her hands together. “You know how things come out? I heard myself saying ‘racist’ and I thought: oh fuck, what have I said? Why did I use that word?”Still, she wasn’t aware of the fallout from the interview until a friend texted her about it that evening. She had been, until that point, relatively unaware of social media. “They listen to absolutely everything and there’s a whole group of people who grab, all the Twitters and the Tweeters that do it. They blast you and that was it. It was off.” Eventually, she shut out the news, and stopped reading about it. “Well, it calmed down, but anyway, some people were saying: ‘Oh, you didn’t get the Oscar because of that.’” She shrugs. “If that’s the way it is, that’s the way it is.” She didn’t watch the ceremony this year, because it was on too late, but was pleased that Olivia Colman, with whom she had worked on Broadchurch, won. “She really is a lovely woman. What a trip, I imagine, winning those two prizes. Boy, does she deserve it. She’s the real thing.”Rampling is so known as a woman of mystery, so often defined by her imperious, implacable characters, that I wonder if there is something contradictory in how open she seems to be, outside of her films. “I’m a complete contradiction,” she smiles. “And that, I think, is what saved me. I’ve always been at ease when I’m talking to people, all through my life. I’ve always enjoyed interviews, because I just talk, and if I say a stupid thing, you know, all right. It’s a way of understanding where I am at a given time.”Where are you at this given time? “I don’t know about that,” she bats back. “Because there’ll be a contradiction that comes in.” She is, though, still busy, still working. She is about to go back to Budapest to film a small part in Denis Villeneuve’s take on Dune (“I’m Reverend Mother Mohiam, who initiates Timothee Chalamet”) and then a Danish TV series, about which she can tell me absolutely nothing, other than that it’s in four languages. “It’s a very different story, I mean really chilling.” It sounds very Charlotte Rampling. “You know, I need the thrill of difference,” she says.•Hannah is on general release now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09a3cc3ea5e5caa6de20b7e967cbc53c90c41be8/0_324_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07360093cdf9a73e0f9f821818a9b6f8","title":"spring onion green tops tabbouleh recipe tom hunt","story":"Are you still throwing away green spring onion tops? Stop, and use them in this spin on a classic tabboulehWhole spring onions are about twice the size of those sold in most shops. They have long, bushy tops that are usually cut off in the fields and discarded, to help pack them neatly and prolong shelf life. It’s our obsession with aesthetically perfect produce and abundance, filling shelves to the brim with food that can’t possibly be sold, that wastes most of our fresh food. But with an efficient logistics system, it would reach us fresher and more nutritious, and wouldn’t need to be wasted, even when it has a short shelf life.At some markets, you can buy spring onions whole, with their tendrils intact. At home, many recipes tell us to cut off the tops and use just the white part. Ignore that advice, if you aren’t already, and use the whole vegetable. Savour those darker green, papery tops, and use them as a delicious ingredient in their own right. They have a subtle, onion flavour, are crisp and crunchy, and can be wilted like leeks, used in hot dishes or chopped finely into salads, such as today’s tabbouleh – my wintry twist on the summer classic.The tops from spring onions are delicious in tabbouleh, adding to the light texture and aroma with the parsley and mint. Swap out or add any seasonal vegetables you have to hand just be sure to chop or shred them finely. To keep spring onions fresher for longer, store them upright in a glass with a little water at the bottom, to feed them.

But there are limits. “If Daniel Levy said to me: ‘Next season we need to win a title, we need to win the Champions League and we need to win the Premier League,’ then maybe you need to find another magic guy who can do this,” the Spurs manager said.Soaring levels of expectation are Pochettino’s curse – an unwanted byproduct, perhaps, of the job he has done since taking over in 2014. Back then it was merely a dream for Spurs to trade punches with the Premier League’s heavyweights, to compete in the Champions League. Now it is a reality. And now people want more.It is also Pochettino’s curse to live in the age of social media, where there is simply no middle ground between being a winner and loser, a hero or a zero. Right now the dial has swung against Pochettino and Spurs. A week ago they had been touted as title contenders. But after the damaging defeats at Burnley and Chelsea Pochettino says the big prize will be “nearly impossible”.The external perception cuts deeper – down to the bone, as usual. Where there was possibility now there is peril. Rather abruptly Spurs enter Saturday’s showdown with Arsenal at Wembley in danger of losing their grip on a top-four finish. Arsenal, in fourth, are four points back but Manchester United and Chelsea, in fifth and sixth, are also too close for comfort.It does not take a soothsayer to predict the reaction to another defeat. Then it would be crisis time for Spurs, before their Champions League last-16 second leg at Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. Pochettino’s team take a 3-0 lead to Germany.When the title talk circulated before the Burnley game it was noted that Spurs still had to visit Liverpool and Manchester City. Win them and who knows what could happen? Now, it is lose them and who knows what could happen?Pochettino shakes his head. For him this is no time to panic, no time to forget how and why Spurs have stepped up a level under him. Another test of his team’s mentality looms but realism and perspective are his watchwords.“You win one against Dortmund and you are the best, so strong you lose after and you are so soft. We are in an era where it is easy to talk. You can read a lot of blogs and opinion and I don’t care about that. We are so strong. I can tell you I am so happy with the mentality of the team. If you win, you are the best. If you lose, you are the worst. You need to accept that.”Pochettino was calm as he looked ahead to the meeting with Arsenal, fortified by his better-than-average record in north London derbies. He has three wins, two defeats and four draws in the league, plus a win and a loss in the League Cup. “How do I keep my balance? Because of my character, knowledge, emotion – because I am mature, I am an old man,” Pochettino said, with a chuckle. “Many reasons.”But Pochettino was not calm after the Burnley defeat, when he blew his top at the referee, Mike Dean, to incur an improper conduct charge from the Football Association, which will be heard next week. He could be banned from the touchline for next Saturday’s trip to Southampton. And he felt the frustration on Tuesday when he said it could be 10 years before Spurs develop the winning mentality needed to become champions. That was the day before the defeat at Chelsea.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsPochettino has felt so near to the title at various points and, deep down, he believes it is an attainable goal. Hence the outpourings when it comes to feel so far away. But in public he prefers to highlight the broader picture, one in which the level of investment in his squad pales when compared with that of the other top six clubs and gives Spurs no right to be where they are.He brought up Arsenal’s purchases of Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for more than £50m apiece while musing how “we are third and we didn’t invest in the last two transfer windows”.Pochettino added: “We are not going to change the way we operate. We are going to be there, we are going to fight but you cannot put a gun to our heads and say: ‘We need to win’ – if we’re not fighting with the same tools as another team. I hear people say: ‘Pochettino is there for five years and didn’t win.’ Of course I didn’t win but, for me, what we are doing here is more than win a title.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbe9389d0e53f624040bb00e92b7dbb34802150e/0_77_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da75e5f003025470091ef40281deff61","title":"virgil van dijk liverpool everton merseyside derby","story":"• Liverpool’s desire can tip balance in Merseyside derby• Van Dijk: ‘We definitely want it the most’Virgil van Dijk believes Liverpool will want victory more than Everton in the Merseyside derby owing to the ramifications for the pursuit of the Premier League title.Everton have not beaten Liverpool since October 2010 and a winless sequence of 16 league derbies is the longest barren spell in the club’s history. The manner of Liverpool’s victory in the 96th minute of December’s derby also smarts for Marco Silva’s side, whose form plummeted afterwards.However, none of those factors compare with the prize of landing Liverpool’s first league championship since 1990, according to Van Dijk, who insists the greater motivation at Goodison Park on Sunday will be among the players in red.The Liverpool defender said: “I’ve played in the Old Firm derby, which is really intense. When I played Rangers were lower level-wise than they are now, so it was pretty easy back then. But this is the Premier League and it’s totally different. It will be a game that can go either way and sometimes in these type of games it is who wants it the most. We are in a position where we definitely want it the most and hopefully we can show it on the pitch.”Van Dijk expects “a game full of passion” and says he will thrive on the knowledge that Everton, like Manchester United last weekend, are desperate to damage their rivals’ title challenge.“I like that,” he said. “It is always something which motivates you even more and it is a great game to play in. It’s the derby and it’s special but we want to show our quality, win the game – hopefully with good football but if not we are going to fight for it.”Jürgen Klopp is friends with a few Evertonians who, as a result, want Liverpool to win the Premier League rather than Manchester City. He refused to ulge names for safety reasons. “I am not allowed to speak about it,” the Liverpool manager, who has won five and drawn two of his seven Merseyside derbies, said, jokingly. “In my normal life I meet quite a lot of Evertonians. They are all nice. I am not sure I am allowed to say that. I promised I would not say their names because that could cause them problems and I don’t want that.Klopp believes Liverpool’s dominance of the derby in recent years should inspire rather than intimidate Everton’s players on Sunday, when Goodison will host its 100th league meeting between the clubs.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels“We respect them a lot as a team.

The World Bank, which has tracked legal changes for the past decade, found these were the only countries in the world to enshrine gender equality in laws affecting work.The bank’s women, business and the law 2019 report, published this week, measured gender discrimination in 187 countries. It found that, a decade ago, no country gave women and men equal legal rights.The index assessed eight indicators that influence economic decisions women make during their working lives – from freedom of movement to getting a pension – tracking legal blocks to either employment or entrepreneurship. Each country was scored and ranked, with a score of 100 indicating the most equal. Only six were given full marks.Research found that, globally, average scores had risen from 70 to 75. Of the 39 countries with scores of 90 or above, 26 were high-income. Eight were in Europe, including the UK, and central Asia, where parental leave was a key trend. Two, Paraguay and Peru, were in Latin America and the Caribbean. Taiwan was also among them.South Asia had the biggest improvement in average regional score, recording a figure of 58.36 – up from 50 a decade ago. Sub-Saharan Africa increased from 64.04 to 69.63 over the same period, led by progress in Mauritius. Half the changes were related to work and marriage.Countries in the Middle East and North Africa made the least progress, with an average increase of just 2.86, to 47.37.The report was launched by the bank’s interim president, Kristalina Georgieva, who took over from Jim Yong Kim.“Gender equality is a critical component of economic growth,” she said. “Women are half of the world’s population and we have our role to play in creating a more prosperous world. But we won’t succeed in playing it if the laws are holding us back.”The report found that women’s rights advocacy groups had played a key role in driving reforms.This represents a missed opportunity, said Georgieva.

I must confess, the grownup half of our family has been dreading the idea of donning wetsuits and clambering through a chilly freshwater gorge. But as we progress upstream through the Isle of Man’s Ballaglass Glen, climbing up rocks and under waterfalls and whizzing down natural slides, we concede it’s one of the best things we’ve done together.I wasn’t expecting the Isle of Man to be such an outdoor playground, but there’s far more to do here than you can fit into a week’s holiday. We choose gorge scrambling because it’s completely new to us, but local firm Adventurous Experiences also runs sea kayaking and coasteering sorties around this green island that’s just a 2hr 45min ferry ride from Liverpool.Getting here is all part of the fun, taking in the sea air from the deck of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company’s ferry, watching the ports shrink and grow – or, if you’re my kids, watching movies in the cinema room.We pull into the seaside town of Douglas, just a 20-minute drive from our accommodation – Kionslieu Farm Cottages – where the owner, the charming Fiona, has organised a welcome basket of essentials. Arriving there, the kids are in heaven, barely stopping to check out our cosy converted stone barn when there are so many animals to meet, pet and help feed – from chickens and rabbits to goats and horses. They’re even more excited when Fiona invites us to take the goats out for a walk with her.Kionslieu’s location makes it the perfect choice for those exploring this tiny island – no point is more than a 40-minute drive from our cottage. One of the Isle of Man’s main attractions for us, though, is just a 10-minute cycle from the farm: the mountain bike trails of South Barrule Plantation. If you’ve travelled by ferry, you can bring your bikes for free, but if you don’t have your own, high-quality bikes can be pre-ordered and delivered to the farm, along with helmets, from Simpsons \u0026amp Pedal Power Cycles in nearby Peel.Perhaps the best thing about this hilly area, planted with conifers, is the mountain-biking skills zone. Here we have great fun – and all for free – on the brilliant wooden wall rides, jumps and drops. Then we swing by the popular Ape Mann Adventure Park for high-flying treetop rope courses.Other activities beckon snorkel safaris, horse riding, sea-fishing trips and stargazing are just some of the things you can do with the kids on the Isle of Man. But there’s history in spades too. We venture to the coast, 15 minutes north-west of Kionslieu, to explore the dramatic Peel Castle – originally constructed by the wonderfully named Viking king Magnus Barefoot. Here, we follow the spectacular walk around its ruined walls and steps down to the colourful scallop shells of Fenella beach.These scallops are one of the culinary highlights of the Isle of Man. One of the best and most family-friendly places to sample them is the Sound Cafe at the island’s south-west tip, just past the thatched crofters’ cottages of ridiculously scenic Cregneash. This circular stone-and-glass cafe was designed to take full advantage of the glorious views of the sunsets and the seals that bob amid the rocks below. We watch in wonder, feasting on local seafood such as Manx queen scallops cooked with bacon, garlic and lashings of butter.Other favourite eateries during our stay include Ballacregga Corn Mill tearooms – beside the island’s iconic Great Laxey Wheel, the largest working waterwheel in the world – where scallops come as part of a ine fish chowder, and the Creek Inn on the quayside at Peel.Heading back to the ferry at Douglas we also discover hip North Quay, where we have a last treat of piri-piri chicken and milkshakes at the Barbary Coast Grill \u0026amp Bar and stock up on fresh-from-the-oven sourdough bread at Noa Bakehouse. Pulling out of port, kids little and large agree that we’ve hardly scratched the surface of this high-octane island, and that it will be only a matter of time before we’re back onboard the boat to Douglas.The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company has regular ferry sailings from Heysham and Liverpool (Birkenhead during winter) and seasonal sailings from Belfast and Dublin.

But, eventually, restlessness kicks inSnuggled up in bed, my son is squished between me and my partner, my daughter is curled up in a corner, having stolen my pillow, and our big black fluffy cat is purring and walking across the lot of us, searching for an empty spot to lie down in. For 10 whole minutes it’s a blissful, cosy start to the day. Nobody needs to rush to work or school, so we have rare time together to chat and laugh in the dim light of the morning. Then my son’s hungry stomach rumbles, the cat digs his claws into my partner and the magic is broken. It’s still only 6.30am. There’s no rest for the wicked – or parents it seems – so I take my moments of calm where I can.Making a big pot of porridge for the family breakfast feels like instant cosiness at very little cost. Stirring the oats with a wooden spoon is hypnotically soothing and the sound of it bubbling gently, mixed with the enticing smell of warm porridge, gets everyone round the table faster than you can say Goldilocks. Each of us has our own favourite topping – maple syrup, bananas, cinnamon, pumpkin seeds – and we start the day full, warm and happy.For us, cosy Sunday mornings are a lazy affair of reading, drawing and playing board games in our pyjamas. All the usual rules about being tidy and quiet go out the window and my eight-year-old’s Beanos, Michelle Obama’s autobiography and my 10-year-old’s latest Jacqueline Wilson book are strewn around as we compete noisily at Connect 4 and Cluedo. There are happy winners and defiant losers but spirits remain surprisingly high as we all take turns DJing from our Spotify playlists. The morning passes to an eclectic mix of The Greatest Showman, Little Mix and Christine and the Queens.Eventually, restlessness kicks in and we pile on our clothes, boots, hats, scarves and gloves and head outside for a boredom-beating walk. Within minutes the kids have, of course, pulled off their hats, scarves and gloves (they have that enviable childhood power of not feeling the cold), dropped the football they’re carrying and asked if we’re nearly there yet, but we’re all still feeling pretty content as we head for the nearest wide open space. For big walks and dog-watching we go to Hampstead Heath, for a stroll through a farmers’ market we choose Alexandra Palace, or for impressive den-building sticks we head to Highgate Wood. The dens usually start out as half-hearted lean-tos made from a bunch of weedy twigs, but once we all get involved and uncover hefty fallen branches, they transform into Grand Designs-style creations that should probably have planning permission.I’ve learnt the hard way that outdoor family peace depends on having food supplies available at all times. To make sure I don’t end up wasting money on overpriced snacks, I have a flask of hot chocolate and some apples handy in case there are any sudden meltdowns by the kids (or the adults).When the cold finally starts to bite and tiredness creeps up on us, we head off to meet our friends for a pub lunch. Is there anything cosier than walking into a welcoming pub with a roaring fire in the middle of winter? We’re not fans of a formal, heavy Sunday roast instead we’ll share a selection of starters and tuck into something spicy and light for our main course. The children are happy with anything as long as it involves chips. The adults chat and catch up over a bottle of malbec, while the kids muck around and play games on their phones together. It’s a stress-free chance to relax and recharge, then it’s all back to ours for coffee and cake. It’s just the best way to spend quality time with loved ones and fend off any thoughts of Monday’s back-to-work-and-school blues.In the evening, it’s the four of us again, back in our pyjamas and settled down for a movie. The heating’s down low to save on costs and our sofa becomes a nest of cushions and thick, comfy blankets as we get sucked into the world of Fantastic Beasts, Minions or The Incredibles and share a bowl of homemade popcorn.Bedtime for the children comes once they start yawning, and I’ll read them a chapter of Harry Potter or How to Train Your Dragon before tucking them into bed. The lights are low and our voices are quiet, but as we share the adventures of whichever story we’re reading I know that these tranquil moments of togetherness are the ones that will stay with me.Finally, I head for my room and pick something to read from the stack beside my bed. My phone is off, our home is quiet and the cat is back and purring by my feet. It’s the calmest of ends to the cosiest of days.Download the Meerkat app and set up EnergyCheck so you’ll never have to spend time searching for better energy deals again.

We’ll be looking at the psychological cycles of buying, as well as the changes that need to come from government level. We want to gather questions from readers and supporters who are experts in related fields, but also those who have personal experiences or reflections to share. In particular we’re looking for positive solutions-based ideas about how we can improve the situation.Lucy Siegle, MP Mary Creagh, and others will be discussing this issue in our next recording. To share your questions, reflections and ideas with them, please email us at: weneedtotalkabout@… providing your question along with your name, age, and country of residence.The fashion industry is big business. In the UK alone, it was worth £32 billion in 2017. According to consultants McKinsey, the global apparel, fashion and luxury industry outperformed all other market indexes in profitability between 2003 - 2013, “outstripping even high-growth sectors like technology and telecommunications”. It is believed one in six people on the planet work in the fashion supply chain, yet it remains one of the most polluting industries on the planet. In our next podcast, we want to ask: How can the fashion industry as a whole be held accountable, and what role can the government, and we as iniduals, play in improving this growing issue?The UN says that given the growth in global population, by 2050 the equivalent of almost three planets could be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. Huge numbers of brands still depend on vastly underpaid workers to make clothing meet consumer demand. In 2013’s Rana Plaza tragedy, a Bangladesh textile factory collapsed, killing 1,134 people, despite warnings over the safety of the structure. It transpired that the building housed five garment factories supplying global fashion brands.In addition to concerns over worker safety, the fashion industry has come under scrutiny for its impact on the environment. During just one washing cycle, a washing machine can leach up to 1000,000 microfibres into our waterways, rivers and oceans, and be consumed by fish, other marine life, and in turn, humans. And clothing is often not recycled – it is believed that Americans dispose of about 12.8m tons of textiles annually. In the UK every year, £140 million worth of used but still wearable clothing (350,000 tonnes) goes to landfill. From an environmental perspective, fast fashion is disastrous.The Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) is one example of how celebrities are using their influence to affect change. This pioneering organisation was founded by Livia Firth and Lucy Siegle in 2010, when Siegle challenged Firth to attend all her red carpet commitments in sustainable clothing. At first she wore ‘ethical’ designers, to the ceremonies, including Orsola de Castro, who designed a dress made out of textile waste for the 2010 Oscars. Now, the business has expanded and the pair work with some of the world’s most famous design houses to help them implement more environmentally responsible business practices.Other prototype solutions that are being trialled include: solar textiles, garments made using biological catalysts which are capable of ‘eating’ plastic, 3D printing for clothes, compostable clothes made from materials such as orange fibre and apple leather, and lab-grown leather. But can any of these offer the practical and long-term solution we need? Is it a case of changing our shopping habits, and buying more second-hand clothes? Or should we be aiming for shifts on a bigger scale? How can we put pressure on fashion houses to implement change? And which is the most promising of the scientific innovations in this area?We look forward to hearing from you!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58130d73275d79049ef5070f76a2a307894ea471/0_691_4608_2765/master/4608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6c723d7cc43eccd139bfec8b7a80ae1","title":"lets move to stirling","story":"Once a stronghold of Scotland’s royalty, this historic town is a mighty fine place to liveWhat’s going for it? There’s no getting around Stirling. Well, OK, pedants, these days you can take the M9 or the Kincardine Bridge, or wiggle your way on the A814 along Loch Long. But in times of yore, when Scotland was more like Game Of Thrones’ Westeros, most roads led through Stirling. This is where Scotland’s waist narrows to a few score miles, and is the lowest bridging point on the River Forth. No wonder they built a castle to end all castles, high on a crag, with a sheer, almost impregnable western slope. No wonder this is where Scotland’s royalty held court from the 16th century. “He who holds Stirling holds Scotland,” went the saying. Of course, these days you can take said M9, so Stirling has settled nicely into a comfortable later life as a mighty fine place to live, with half Scotland’s population within an hour’s drive. There are fewer battles here, and a lot less buckles to be swashed but, on the upside, it’s a gorgeous town, an Edinburgh in miniature, only with fewer bagpipe buskers and stag parties from Woking.The case against Perhaps a little sedate but Glasgow’s only up the road.Well connected?

His publicist had muddled up the time of our meeting, and I rang up to his hotel room in Knightsbridge a whole hour too early. Previn was in town to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra and his ex-wife, violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, the soloist in Brahms’ Violin Concerto was with him. “You want to do an interview? You just woke me up!” he snarled down the receiver. I apologised, and he said he’d see me in 15 minutes.When he arrived, hair uncombed and hobbling on a walking stick – “it’s not an affectation, I really do need it,” he said – grumpiness was etched into every pore. We sat in the bar, and things went from bad to worse. A waitress brought him the wrong drink and a fan hoping for an autograph went away empty-handed. And my first question, about how Previn’s background as an émigré Jew had informed his work, tanked. “Nothing to say about that. Next!”But I was aware of his history. The man sitting next to me had worked with Ralph Vaughan Williams and Olivier Messiaen with Oscar Peterson and Ravi Shankar had scored the film version of My Fair Lady, for which he won one of his four Oscars. He had recorded Shostakovich with Leonard Bernstein and Peter Maxwell Davies with Isaac Stern – and had been famously slapped on the cheeks by Eric Morecambe as Ernie Wise looked on in mock horror. I had to get this man to talk.And gradually – very gradually – he began to warm up. Born Andreas Ludwig Priwin on 6 April 1929, his family relocated to Los Angeles in 1941. By 1946, the young Previn was working for MGM Studios as an arranger, composer and occasional conductor. “I can’t pretend it was an awful life,” he reflected. “They hired me because I could do the work and I was cheap. The sun always shone but for my ambitions it was a dead-end street.”Previn explained that nobody was ever precious: “‘Here’s the movie, here’s the scene’, just go away and write the score. I got to conduct my own music for the first time, and I learned how to rehearse very fast, because the musicians were incredible. Even if the music was garbage, it was always played very well.”French conductor Pierre Monteux – famous for leading the premiere of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring in 1913 – took him under his wing, and soon enough, ambition led Previn towards conducting classical repertoire. “Monteux came to a very early concert of mine,” Previn recalled. “‘Do you think the orchestra played well?’ he asked me after the concert. I nodded. ‘Me too,’ he said, ‘so next time keep out of their way’.”That matter-of-fact professionalism, drilled into Previn during his time in Hollywood, never went away. Not for him the neurosis of tonality versus atonality that kept Bernstein awake all night, or the ideological spats provoked by Pierre Boulez. Previn wanted to make the music work – for it to sound as brilliant, as lyrical or as sonorously rich as the composer intended.We talked through his groundbreaking 1977 recording of Messiaen’s Turangalîla-Symphonie with the LSO, and how, when he first performed the piece with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the musicians had loathed it. “‘What kind of rubbish is this?’ some players asked me, but the LSO came to like it – they were proud of themselves for managing it.”Previn’s period as principal conductor of the LSO, between 1968 and 79, was a golden era indeed for the orchestra, but not everything went to plan. “That record we made with Ravi Shankar was absolute, total, utter shit,” he said “When we got to the recording the studio was crammed full of incense sticks and Shankar was embarrassed because he hadn’t orchestrated it. Somehow we made the record, but I knew it was nonsense. Later, I heard Shankar talking on the radio, and he said it hadn’t been such a wonderful experience. ‘Good for you,’ I thought – it wasn’t so great for me, either.”I asked about composers he enjoyed performing. “Mozart – it’s always been Mozart,” while of his recordings, he said: “I remain extraordinarily proud of the Vaughan Williams symphonies I recorded with the LSO, and in the 1980s and 90s I made an almost complete cycle of orchestral works by Richard Strauss with the Vienna Philharmonic. That was a source of pride for me because that’s really their music.”Another drink, and I ask Previn about his work as a jazz pianist, styled after Art Tatum and Peterson. Did he consider jazz a parallel career to his classical work? “I remember reading an interview with Van Cliburn – who was indeed a very great pianist – and he said that he might try to play some jazz ‘next year’, and I thought, ‘Oh really?’ That infuriated me. I don’t want to consider jazz something you do once in a while.”By now Previn was gregarious, even jolly. The discussion turned to minimalism – “It’s kind of mean music, I prefer a lush sound,” – and a conversation he’d once had with Boulez (“a brilliant man”) about how electronic music could give every note computer-like precision, and from Boulez we moved seamlessly to Morecambe \u0026amp Wise. I told Previn that my favourite line of the sketch – which sent up Eric’s efforts to play the Grieg Piano Concerto – was “for another fiver we could have had Ted Heath”. Previn’s face creased with mirth, and I was pleased to see that the sketch meant as much to him as everybody else. “Eric was very worried that I wasn’t a comedian. He said, ‘If anyone thinks we’re trying to be funny, we’re finished. We must act as though it’s very serious.’ The sketch was scheduled at about five minutes, but when we did it on air it was nearer 10. Eric added bits as he went, like when he slapped my face. To this day, whenever I walk down a street in London someone will shout, ‘Hey, Mr Preview.’ Every single bloody time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166f65a62cd64034126de9ddf6182115c9cfdb13/0_104_4720_2832/master/4720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef7ff992059f6fd3e61120812f865613","title":"arron banks man who bankrolled brexit podcast today in focus","story":"Carole Cadwalladr has been covering the biggest pro-leave donor for nearly two years.

He also suggested that the parliamentary arithmetic might be moving in the prime minister’s favour.“We will not allow a time limit or a one-sided exit right,” Barnier told the newspaper. “What can exist is the commitment to limit the backstop through an agreement on the future relationship … in the form of an interpretive document. Like the joint letter from Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker. If this document were combined with a written commitment from the British, then obviously it would have a much greater power.”It is the first time the EU official has publicly confirmed that such a legal instrument, previously used by the bloc to sweeten deals by offering an optimistic interpretation of terms of draft treaties, was a possibility.The EU’s 27 heads of state and government rejected such a step last December as they did not want to offer any suggestion of a time limit to the backstop, even if it involved a soft target for escaping from the arrangement. It had been mooted at the time that the legal document would commit both sides to trying to get out of the backstop within 12 months of it being triggered. The leaders rejected the idea as they were not convinced that such an interpretation was feasible or that it would persuade the Commons to back the deal.A letter from Tusk, the European council president, and his European commission counterpart, Juncker, sent to May in January had committed the EU to ensuring that the backstop was temporary, although there was no specific time limit.Barnier declined to offer any further detail when pressed by Die Welt. “That’s currently in the negotiations. The substance has priority. The legal form comes afterwards.”Barnier disclosed, however, that Jeremy Corbyn had told him during a recent visit to Brussels that Labour was poised to back a second referendum. “Jeremy Corbyn sat at this table last week and told me that he would announce support for a second vote,” he said. “I cannot say if there will be such a vote at all, whether enough MPs would vote for it. That is not my basis. I only work on objective fundamentals.”Theresa May is seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to reassure MPs that the Irish backstop will be temporary.Downing Street is said to have been encouraged by the suggestions that Brexiters in the European Research Group in her party appear to be looking for a way to back down on their resistance to the deal.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the ERG, has recently said he would accept a mere add-on to the withdrawal agreement, but insisted that this would need to include a time limit on the all-UK customs union envisaged in the Irish backstop.Barnier told Die Welt that he sensed that “something was moving” in the UK. An EU diplomat said: “Barnier seemed to think that the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, at least offered a more realistic position, brainstorming to find something that was within the EU’s red lines.”The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and Cox were expected back in Brussels on Tuesday for further negotiations.At the meeting of ambassadors with Barnier on Friday morning, the 27 member states agreed that the length of a delay to Brexit would depend on the reason given by the prime minister.The EU is examining a range of options if the UK makes a formal request for an extension, with the potential length ranging between two and 21 months. But legal experts have advised the German parliament that any Brexit delay beyond the European elections on 23-26 May could be in breach of EU law and leave the UK open to legal action, according to a confidential report seen by Die Welt.The newspaper said the Bundestag’s European law experts had concluded that even the “short, limited” two- or three-month extension to article 50 beyond 29 March promised to MPs by May if they again vote down her Brexit deal could prove problematic.“Failure by the UK to hold European parliament elections in the event of an agreed extension of the negotiation deadline under article 50 raises deep concerns regarding the right of citizens to vote and stand, as well as … possible legal consequences,” Die Welt quoted the advice as saying.If the UK does not take part in the European elections while it is still officially a member of the bloc, “British nationals resident in the UK would be denied a core set of rights giving them EU citizenship status,” the advice said. This would amount to “a violation of the active and passive voting rights of British nationals”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bb8acc960cf11d3618ab97e72496b63a4ba8236/0_24_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d751265b508dcac4a91c7deb1d6b2fb","title":"chuka umunna i never felt totally comfortable in the labour party","story":"Exclusive: Streatham MP says decision to breakaway and form TIG, ‘hugely liberating’Chuka Umunna, who quit Labour last week to form the breakaway Independent Group, has said he never felt “comfortable” in his old party – and found his mixed cultural and class background were “a chain round my neck”.One of eight Labour MPs who joined the Independent Group (TIG), citing antisemitism and Jeremy Corbyn’s handling of Brexit, the Streatham MP said the decision to leave behind what he called a “culture of fear” in the Labour party had been “hugely liberating”.“If truth be told, certainly culturally, I never felt totally comfortable in the Labour party, because I’ve never really been a massively tribal politician,” he told the , as he reflected on what he called the “roller-coaster ride” of the past fortnight, in his Westminster office.“I have quite a different background from a lot of people in the Labour party – I’m of mixed heritage,” he said. “My father was a black, working-class man who arrived here with no money in his pocket from Nigeria my mum came from more of a middle-class background, whose father had prosecuted the Nazis at Nuremberg. We have a really rich and erse heritage in my family – but I sometimes felt it was a bit of a chain round my neck in the Labour party if truth be told.”He added that when he briefly stood for the party leadership in 2015, before withdrawing, he was warned that being of BAME background could count against him.“The team who were helping me organise, were told by quite a few MPs that they weren’t going to support me, because they didn’t think their working-class constituents would ever vote for a black man – and I was quite taken aback by it,” he says, adding that his new TIG colleagues are more representative of modern Britain.Umunna only joined Labour in the 1990s, after the reforms initiated by Tony Blair, and said perhaps the period up to 2010, when Ed Miliband took over, was a historic aberration, and his old party had now reverted to type.“Maybe what we’ve seen happen in the Labour party since the late 1990s and through to 2010, was actually exceptional, and wasn’t what the Labour party really is?”The eleven MPs – eight Labour and three Conservatives – who make up TIG are not yet a political party, don’t have a set of formal policies, and admit that previous attempts to break the mould of British politics have not met with unalloyed success.But Umunna hailed Jeremy Corbyn’s cautious shift towards support for a second referendum on Monday as evidence the group had already made an impact.“I don’t believe it would have happened, were it not for our resignations. We appear to have had more influence on Labour’s Brexit policy out of the party than we ever had while we were in it,” he says, with a smile – although he still doubts whether Corbyn will whip his MPs to support a referendum.“The key test is, will the leader be able to ensure that at the very least, frontbenchers won’t be able to block a people’s vote from happening?” he says.Asked about the progress of the Brexit debate over the past two-and-a-half years, Umunna is fiercely critical of what he claims is the refusal of some Labour MPs to confront their constituents about the effects of immigration.“I recognise the challenges – and admittedly I represent a different area – but you can either lie, and say, ‘I agree with you that immigration is the cause of our problems’, which I think is fundamentally dishonest or you can try and engage with them, and resolve the anxieties and concerns and don’t duck the cultural issues.”Many MPs across both main parties concluded from the result of the Brexit referendum in 2016 that voters would like to see an end to unfettered free movement of people from the European Union.And some Labour MPs have rejected softer forms of Brexit, such as a Norway-style deal, because they would not allow the government to control who comes to work in Britain from the EU.Umunna says that when he hears the argument, “Oh, my constituents are telling me that the reason we have challenges in this community is because of immigrants, and I’m not sure I totally agree with that but I’ve got to roll with that”, it makes him wonder how the same politicians would have responded to previous waves of migration.“I just think, what the hell would you have said in the 1970s when my father came? Would you have been defending him, and many of the people who came from the West Indies, Asia and Africa? Or would you have been saying the same thing: ‘My constituents are saying that these brown and black people are the cause of our problems, so I’ve just got to run with it’?”.In his own south London patch, he says, there are “more acute social problems – substance abuse, domestic violence, housing shortages and so on, than many of the areas that voted to leave. But we just didn’t believe that voting to leave the European Union was going to solve those problems”.Umunna brushes off the idea that he and his new ex-Conservative allies will struggle to unite around a set of policies, insisting that the old left-right ide is rapidly being supplanted by others.“Your age, your academic qualifications, where you live in the country, whether you have a nationalistic or an internationalist view of the world. Whether you’re socially liberal or conservative. These factors are driving people’s voting behaviour more than ever,” he says. He describes what unites them as a “radical centrist” agenda.And he says the leadership’s response to the quitters has only reinforced their sense that they have done the right thing.“The points that we were making about the arid, aggressive, bullying culture within the party has been underlined by the reaction of a number of people to the departures that there have been – Emily Thornberry with her ongoing leadership campaign claiming that we will be ‘crushed’, Lloyd Russell-Moyle, calling us scabs, and other such reactions,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ace3b252d8e2df4712c409410ebc5f77d9765d/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc86e8d70ffb3f5893774cb40a0c3de7","title":"anorexia coaches kik app prey eating disorders","story":"App hosts dozens of group chats where youngsters are given strict weight-loss adviceThousands of young people with eating disorders are being preyed on by “anorexia coaches” operating on an anonymous messaging app, a  investigation can reveal.Kik, a popular app among children and teenagers that has previously come under fire over safeguarding issues, hosts dozen of pro-anorexia group chats that are open to the public.Within minutes of joining a conversation, users can be approached by an “anorexia coach” who calls on vulnerable young people, usually girls, to message them for weight-loss advice. If the recipients do not follow strict advice to limit their calorie intake, the coaches tell them they need to be punished – in some cases asking them to send nude pictures. found at least 71 pro-anorexia groups with a combined total of more than 2,000 members operating under easily searchable terms. On joining the groups, people are asked to give their age, height, current weight and goal weight.This comes despite community guidelines for the app saying self-harm, eating disorders or suicide should not be shown or promoted.Dr Louise Theodosiou, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, described the findings as “extremely concerning”.Luciana Berger, the MP for Liverpool Wavertree, said: “It is incredibly disturbing that users of Kik are able to exploit and manipulate vulnerable young people in this way.“The government’s announcement that they intend to introduce new legislation to compel social media companies to remove content that encourages suicide and self-harm earlier this month is welcome, but well overdue. It also does not go far enough.” revealed this month that there has been a big rise in hospital admissions for eating disorders in the past year, prompting concern from experts about a growing crisis of young people experiencing anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.Figures show year-on-year rises in hospital visits, with admission numbers more than doubling from 7,260 in 2010-11 to 16,023 in the year to April 2018. The latest figure is up from 13,885 the year before – the highest rise in eight years.One woman who has an eating disorder, and worked with an anorexia coach on Kik, said she was asked to send naked pictures when she did not meet her calorie limit for the day. “If you deviate from a diet plan they would demand you send naked pictures of yourself as punishment,” she said.She added that she felt most of the coaches were men. “They ask for photographs of any food you eat and say you also have to ask permission to do anything, such as exercise.”One of the people who appears to be a male coach running a group has been on Kik for more than three years. Another user has been on for more than four months and is an admin of multiple groups.A main attraction of Kik that differentiates it from other messaging apps is its anonymity. The Canada-based app, which was founded in 2009 and claims 300m accounts worldwide, says users who feel unsafe should report content to them. “Kik is being used to promote eating disorders and contains pro-anorexia groups despite the platform’s community guidelines which prohibit such activity,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a social media expert and assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University.The app has come under fire in the past for its approach to extremist groups who have used the platform. Chief constable Simon Bailey, the child protection lead for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), said last year that Kik was prone to abuse by paedophiles after the number of UK child abuse reports relating to the service quadrupled in the last two and a half years.Charities and experts recently called on Instagram to crack down on images of eating disorders in the same way the app was planning to do with graphic self-harm images, as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of the British teenager Molly Russell. A spokesperson for the eating disorder charity Beat said: “So-called ‘pro-ana’ and ‘pro-mia’ content is widespread on social media and can be very harmful for people suffering from an eating disorder. People will not develop an eating disorder by being exposed to content that glamorises eating disorders, but research shows that such content helps perpetuate the illnesses for people who are already suffering.” A spokesperson for Kik said: “We take online safety very seriously, and we’re constantly assessing and improving our trust and safety measures … We encourage users to report content that they believe violates the Kik Terms of Service and Community Standards. Users are also able to block other users they no longer wish to chat with, or ignore chats from people that they don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a23cf73427a13ee06e18159ab9a738c6b68a1367/0_219_4300_2580/master/4300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f2588cfa4a29a225b1e2da2e2085df","title":"bristol gloucester premiership rugby union match report","story":"Bristol’s first victory over Gloucester in the Premiership for 11 years could hardly have materialised at a more opportune moment. This breathless win, their first league victory of 2019, has put the Bears 13 points clear of bottom-placed Newcastle and also sharply improved their prospects of avoiding relegation.There were several moments when Bristol looked quite capable of throwing away one of their best results of the campaign, not least when Gloucester were awarded a late penalty virtually in front of the posts with the hosts leading 25-24. Billy Twelvetrees had previously kicked everything but this time the ball faded wide and an outstanding 79th-minute long-range penalty from Ian Madigan compounded the visitors’ frustration.For Gloucester supporters it was a salutary reminder that nothing in this relentlessly competitive league can be guaranteed. Despite having beaten the top two sides, Exeter and Saracens, in their last two outings they lacked consistent rhythm and duly missed out on the chance to regain third place at the expense of Harlequins. “Bristol are not just a side making up the numbers they’re as good as anyone,” lamented Gloucester’s head coach, Johan Ackermann.It was also a night that underlined just how much the professional game owes to players of Pacific island heritage. Bristol possess more than most and Pat Lam, the Bears’ head coach, rightly described the proposal not to involve Fiji, Samoa and Tonga in a projected new 12-team World League as “a slap in the face” prior to kick-off.Not that the home side needed any extra motivation, having failed to beat the Cherry and Whites in the Premiership since February 2008. Scoring points has not been their problem this season and inside 90 seconds they had registered a fine try, the former Gloucester flanker Dan Thomas finishing off a slick team attack launched by Charles Piutau.There could have been a second following a slicing break through the middle by Harry Thacker but Bristol also retain the ability to keep the opposition interested. There is space out wide against them for anyone clever enough to exploit it and nice passes from Twelvetrees and Danny Cipriani duly put Jason Woodward over unopposed in the right-hand corner.Twelvetrees’ conversion also edged the visitors ahead but Bristol’s energy and ingenuity in attack continued unabated. Their problem is over-enthusiasm, with their ability to retain the ball in their own half not always repaying their ambition. Even so the Bears were still ahead at the interval, with two sure-footed penalties from Callum Sheedy earning them a deserved 11-7 lead.Gloucester also had to overcome the loss of their captain, Willi Heinz, who suffered an early head knock and were suitably grateful for an early second-half penalty from Twelvetrees. Any feelings of relief did not last long, a trademark break from the fit-again Luke Morahan splintering the visiting defence and the excellent Andy Uren touching down at full stretch in the left corner.Madigan, on at half-time for Sheedy, coolly slotted the conversion but Bristol rarely deal in the mundane. First Tom Marshall scored athletically in the right-hand corner before Ollie Thorley, capitalising on a defensive howler close to his own line, put Gloucester back in front. Twelvetrees converted both only for a deliberate knock on by Woodward to leave the Bears with a man advantage.An unstoppable 13-man driven maul duly yielded a penalty try and another yellow for Ed Slater, setting up another of the frantic finales in which this competition specialises. Even in the closing seconds there could still have been a dramatic postscript with Gloucester forcing a close-range attacking lineout but the Bristol pack, still full of energy, killed the drive and secured the priceless West Country spoils. “The moment you focus on the bottom, you end up at the bottom,” said Lam, hopeful there is even better to come. “We’re only five points off fifth place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d28ef5b05bca560aa2f1321a1ee19386238e03eb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0404f86645efb46158d8004b9e857a4","title":"talking horses javert strike gold newbury emma lavelle horse racing tips","story":"Four times a winner from his eight forays over fences, Javert can land the day’s big betting race, the Greatwood Gold CupIt has generally paid to follow Paul Nicholls in Newbury’s Greatwood Gold Cup, the Ditcheat trainer having saddled a remarkable eight winners in 12 years. But this year’s renewal could provide a pre-Cheltenham boost to the Emma Lavelle stable, whose Javert (2.40) looks overpriced in the early betting at 12-1.Four times a winner from his eight forays over fences, Javert was below his best in Cheltenham’s BetVictor when last seen. But he is on the same mark as when chasing home Frodon in the Old Roan and, with Tom Scudamore aboard for the first time, can make a big impact here.Dolos will surely show up well for Nicholls, while his former assistant trainer, Dan Skelton, could also go close with Azzuri.1.50 Doncaster A staying trip on a sound surface seems to be what Bordeaux Bill wants and that combination of factors helped him score at Kelso last time. Just 4lb higher, he could follow up in similar circumstances here without even achieving a career best.2.05 Newbury One of the day’s more absorbing contests, this counts as further proof of the value of veterans’ races. It is very interesting to see Houblon Des Obeaux back in such company, considering how smoothly he moved through a similar race at Sandown in January, and he can be forgiven his defeat in a hotter race against younger rivals on softer ground last time. Shanroe Santos is another plausible winner, from a hot yard with a capable claimer aboard. But both may have to give best to The Last Samuri, who was conveniently dropped 4lb for his last run and consequently sneaks in under the ratings bar. This is his lowest mark since he was runner-up in the 2016 Grand National and there was some promise in his Taunton second last time.2.25 Doncaster Having produced his best effort yet over course and distance when last seen, Cracking Find is hard to oppose in this small field. The Sue Smith yard continues in fine form.3.00 Doncaster On what could be another fruitful Saturday for Nicholls Danse Idol can land this Listed prize for novice mares. Unable to cope with Queenohearts on her last two starts, she may be seen to better effect on this sounder surface.3.15 Kelso Fourth place in one of the year’s hottest handicap hurdles was a fine effort by Getaway Trump at Ascot last month and the Nicholls runner is the one to stick with here. An extra couple of furlongs should help this time and he has enough class to see off Rouge Vif.3.35 Doncaster Kim Bailey’s yard seemed to be going out of form when Rocky’s Treasure was a beaten favourite at Warwick in mid-January but the winners are flowing from that Gloucestershire stable once more and this small-field handicap looks a good opportunity for the novice.

From folding handsets and ultra-sophisticated cameras to brick-like smartphones with a very long battery life – here are eight of the most notable products from Mobile World Congress 2019 this week.Annoyed with your phone’s battery not lasting a day? What if you could have a phone that lasted a full week? That’s the idea behind Energizer’s Power Max P18K Pop.Looking more like a phone strapped to a brick, it has a humongous 18,000mAh battery that’s almost seven times the size of the one in the iPhone XS. It has a 6.2in screen, runs on the latest Android software and will cost €599 in the summer. Whether you’ll be able to squeeze it into a pocket remains to be seen.Move over 4G, the 5G network is coming later this year. Unlike previous jumps in mobile phone network technology, the handsets are already here, with almost every manufacturer launching a version of their top-end phones with 5G capability.With much higher capacity, super-quick speeds and ultra-low latency (the time it takes for your phone to contact the internet and get a reply), 5G promises to be the enabler for all sorts of things, from self-driving cars and all sorts of smart devices to high-resolution movies downloaded in seconds.With the first 5G areas expected to go live in the UK in the summer, it will be some time before everyone can try it out. But you have to start somewhere.What if your phone could unfold to be the size of a tablet? That’s the basic idea behind Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which was the first phone with a foldable screen to be launched by a big manufacturer. Samsung put a smaller 4.6in screen on the outside and a bigger 7.3in screen on the inside that opens out like a book for watching videos, browsing the web or multitasking with three apps on the go simultaneously.It will be available in the US in April and in Europe the following month. The only catch? It will cost $1,980 (£1,500). Or about twice the cost of its new Galaxy S10+. Ouch.Not to be outdone, the Chinese smartphone giant Huawei had a foldable phone on show at MWC, too. But where Samsung’s had the screen on the inside, the Mate X looked even more futuristic, with the foldable screen wrapped around the outside.When shut it has a 6.6in screen on the front and a 6.38in screen on the back. Turn it over and it swaps the screen from the front to the back of the device, for taking selfies or similar. Unfold the screen outwards and you’re left with one large 8in display ready to go. It has cameras on one side and is 5G-capable.Huawei said it will be available in the summer for €2,299 (£1,975). No one said pushing boundaries was going to be cheap.If you like the idea of having a phone that unfolds with a bigger screen but aren’t sold on the idea of a bendable screen, LG has the answer: slap your phone in a case that also contains another phone screen on the inside.The new top-of-the-range LG V50 ThinQ has a case accessory called the Dual Screen, which attaches to the phone to double the display. It is far from seamless, with a big hinge in the middle, but you can use one screen for your email with a keyboard on the other, or one can be turned into a games controller. Not quite as revolutionary as a folding screen but at least you can take it off when the novelty wears thin.Holding your phone in your hand is so last century. If the Nubia Alpha is anything to go by, we’ll all be wearing our phones around our wrists. It may look like a sci-fi electronic tag but the 4in flexible display wraps around your wrist like a snap-band with a camera mounted on the front.It can be activated by touch or even mid-air hand gestures, while users can take calls on it, send messages, shoot photos and watch films on it. Available in April from €449.Forget virtual reality. The future is mixed or augmented reality, according to the tech giants. Think of what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character sees in the Terminator film: information overlaid on your real view of the world, albeit via a set of glasses. Microsoft’s Hololens 2 is the latest iteration, now with a larger field of view and more comfortable to wear, even if the helmet-like product is quite chunky.Users have a virtual display floating in their vision, such as a map of wires and pipes behind a wall about to be subject to your DIY, or instructions on how to fix your your bike, leaving your hands free to do the work. That’s the pitch to businesses – who are the target customers. A consumer version will have to wait for smaller glasses that don’t cost $3,500 a piece.The days of only having one camera on your phone – or maybe even two - are dead. Now it’s five or bust. Or so says Nokia, with its new 9 PureView smartphone, which has five separate 12-megapixel cameras mounted in an array on the back alongside a flash and a depth-sensor.Nokia says the system collects up to 10 times the amount of light normally captured by one camera. Instagram influencers will take note. Expected to go on sale for around £550 in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05839fc1ad502740ed5e5fe33d6247c43f8c2cc6/0_216_4057_2434/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ecd146c8bbbbd9925a53c12050d20a7","title":"private firm defends school factsheet on momo hoax","story":"Charities say parental guidance about scary-doll challenges may have worsened issueA private company that provides schools with internet safety material has insisted it behaved responsibility by issuing factsheets on the Momo challenge hoax, despite concerns it may have exacerbated the panic surrounding the issue.National Online Safety produced a factsheet entitled “What parents need to know about Momo”, which many UK schools sent home with children.The guidance offered straightforward advice on internet safety but also quoted media reports about the Momo challenge in which a “scary doll-like figure reportedly sends graphic violent images, and asks users to partake in dangerous challenges like waking up at random hours and has even been associated with self-harm”.Children’s charities have said well-intentioned warnings from schools about a seemingly non-existent threat may have inadvertently caused young people to be genuinely scared by what was previously a hoax. Some copycat videos have started to emerge, with YouTube removing adverts from any videos mentioning the topic.National Online Safety is a private company based in Scunthorpe that sells training services to schools and parents on how to be safe online.Schools are increasingly buying such resources, often due to a lack of in-house knowledge, raising questions about who is providing the guidance and why it is being left to the private sector.Teachers have said the regulator, Ofsted, will penalise schools who fail to teach children about online risks but that there is no central government guidance on which internet threats they should take seriously.“We’re fighting a losing battle on safeguarding because we can’t keep up with the technological changes,” said one assistant headteacher at a south London primary. He said his school had decided against warning parents about the Momo challenge and this may have played a role in ensuring there was no outbreak of the panic among its pupils.Many of the claims in the factsheet were sourced to reports on the BBC and newspaper websites, including articles which have since been retracted for including false information.“We noticed a lack of information for parents and we had no choice but to respond. We did so by producing a guide for parents and carers which is balanced. If that has enabled conversations between parents and children about online safety and led to more monitoring of children’s online activities then that is a good thing.”Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said it was understandable that teachers turned to outside providers: “One of the benefits of the digital age is that schools are readily able to access a wide range of sources to support lessons and provide information. It saves time and resources, and allows them to utilise external expertise and advice.”“The downside is that in a fast-moving environment of rolling news and social media, information which is produced and utilised in good faith may not turn out to be as reliable as it first seemed. The Momo hoax reminds us all to be sceptical about a phenomenon which suddenly goes viral.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/716c3a6c78b435d213cc65f413275c259a0905d9/0_246_7301_4382/master/7301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b00bc26267b3b157b8cbab85cf801a6","title":"tip a great beach cafe or bar in europe for a chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Good food and drink can set a beach venue apart from the rest, especially if there’s a cool view.

We have always maintained that perhaps the best thing about Upside journalism is it encourages readers to hope, to engage, even to take action to make the world a slightly better place.And that’s what happened this week. Within hours of publishing a moving article by Bethan McKernan on a group of Yazidi women who have somehow turned their lives around, we were inundated with offers of help. Books, toys, sewing machines and financial contributions.Just a quick line to say how thoroughly beautiful the recent article about Yazidi women forming an all-female commune was. It isn’t often you hear positive news about Yazidi women, but to hear of such a wonderful project brought such hope in a consistently worrying news cycle.”Roisin, by emailWe have connected the benefactors (all of them women) with the community, and will report back on how your donations made a difference.And now, another small way you can help. We all recognise that climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing the world. But the Upside team is not convinced that simply repeating dire warnings about global warming will galvanise any sort of adequate response.Instead, we’d like to show the world what people, towns, communities and government can and are doing to address the carbon splurge that is threatening to destabilise our climate.Hundreds have responded already. Simply fill in this short form and let us know what you, your family, your business or your community is up to. And watch for the upshot in a future edition of the Upside Weekly.In other Upside news this week, the Observer’s Robin McKie looked into a new initiative to get to grips with illegal logging, our US team spoke to a nun helping people survive by collecting cans discarded in New York, and our video team found out more about the women who give food and water to migrants riding the infamous freight train north towards the US.And in Japan, Justin McCurry tucked into possibly the healthiest school lunch in the world.Our data team didn’t have to look far for positive numbers this week. Air quality may not be great in parts of Europe – but it’s a lot better than it was 10 or 20 years ago.Also, Norway is showing the world what to do with its old plastic bottles, as Positive News found out.Large numbers of readers contacted us in response to our week of coverage about concrete, particularly the Upside article on alternatives to this dirty building block of the global economy.I am following your articles on concrete and am really glad that you are covering this issue at last. You’ve asked for other possible solutions and I have two major ones.As a design company we have several alternatives to concrete foundations that can be used for ANY building – not just ‘eco’ ones.

But the “restaurant” is actually a classroom at Konan primary school in central Japan, where the pupils need only the gentlest encouragement to eat their greens.When the  visited the school in the Pacific coastal city of Fukuroi, the classroom, momentarily transformed into a lunchtime cafeteria, reverberated to a chorus of “Itadakimasu” – a polite Japanese term for “let’s eat”.On the menu today is baked cod, sautéed sweet corn and bok choy, minestrone soup, a small carton of milk and, as a Friday treat, a slightly less wholesome combination of white bread with a soy-based chocolate “cream” – a challenge to spread evenly on the bread with chopsticks.The portions are modest, but then so is the total calorie count – 667 kcal for a meal that will sustain the 11-year-old children until they get home.Konan is not the only school in Japan producing a range of lunches – or kyushoku – that combine flavour with fresh ingredients and contain levels of iron, calcium and fibre stipulated by a government-run programme for children attending kindergarten through to the end of junior high school.The kyushoku system was introduced in the 1950s to ensure that children did not have experience the dietary privations of the immediate postwar years. More than seven decades on, the programme is credited with contributing to Japan’s impressive life expectancy, and child and adult obesity levels that are among the lowest in the OECD group of nations.Local officials refer to their school meals as the healthiest in a country with one of the healthiest cuisines in the world. It is no empty boast: last year Fukuroi won a World Health Organization best practice award for promoting healthy dietary habits among schoolchildren, with the help of local producers.The city’s school lunch centres prepare and send out more than 10,000 lunches to kindergartens, primary and junior high schools every day. Most of the meals are inspired by Japanese cuisine, with the occasional inclusion of Chinese, Korean and European dishes. Parents pay ¥250 (£1.70) a meal, about half of what they cost to make, with the local government contributing the rest.“We devise the monthly menu so that there is something different every day,” says Koji Ishizuka, the manager of the school lunch ision at the city’s board of education. “And each month differs depending on what’s in season.”In 2005, the government took its school lunch programme a step further by requiring school boards to educate children about the provenance and composition of their lunches.As the children at Konan tuck into lunch, Mihoko Kobayashi, one of two nutrition educators in Fukuroi, tells them where the bok choy they are eating was grown and why, despite clear reservations among some pupils, they should eat every last morsel.“Please remember that a lot of people were involved in preparing your lunch,” she says. “Especially when you come across a vegetable you think you won’t like.”The bok choy converts have Toshiyuki Suzuki to thank for a portion of their lunch. The local farmer sends 4 tonnes of the leafy vegetable to Fukuroi schools every year. “Freshness is absolutely essential,” he says. “The vegetables I sell commercially have to go through a distribution system, but I sell directly to schools, so the vegetables the kids are eating are the freshest around.”“Children generally acquire their long-term eating habits by the time they’re 10, so that’s why we think school lunches are so important,” says Ishizuka. “The results of regular health checks on the children are generally good, and we believe school lunches have something to do with that.”Dr Atsushi Miyawaki, a health policy specialist at Tokyo University’s graduate school of medicine, says removing choice from the menu and banning packed lunches are the “most remarkable” features of the programme.“It offers a uniform menu to all children in each school five days a week, unlike the cafeteria-style school lunches often found in the US and UK,” Miyawaki says. “That means the children have no choice regarding menu items, or whether to eat school lunch or bring it from home.“That helps avoid an imbalance in nutritional intakes. And the lack of choice can help hide disparities in the children’s socioeconomic background that may be evident in packed lunches.”The lunch monitors load trays of empty plates on to trolleys and wheel them to the kitchen while their classmates file out to complete the final task of their day’s food education: brushing their teeth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17059a68dc9fea310fcbe4b8c7dd6805625fd928/212_0_4363_2619/master/4363.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14183f4a2c63d1fc825cdee25daba751","title":"bike country n0 1 dutch electric record numbers e bikes netherlands","story":"E-bikes now outsell standard bicycles in Netherlands, with quality prized more than price In what was already a long-running purple patch for the Dutch cycle industry, domestic sales records have been broken in the last 12 months despite spiralling prices, as technological developments push the standard push-bike into the annals of history.The Dutch love affair with the bicycle is well chronicled – there are 22.5m of them in a country of 17 million people – but has moved up a level, according to a study by the RAI Vereniging, an organisation representing the automotive and cycling sector.Asked whether rising prices would begin to put the Dutch public off the two-wheeled mode of transport, RAI’s Floris Liebrand said: “Not in the Netherlands. It is in our culture, in our blood.“We are bike country No 1 in the world so we are used to investing in innovative bikes so there is difference there compared with other countries, including the UK.“For us it quite normal to spend €1,000 on a bike. An average for an e-bike is over €2,000 but that is in our culture. We believe in the quality of our products. There are e-bikes of €700 or €900 but they are from south-east Asia and the quality is lower.”The buoyant sales are partly being put down to the good weather of the summer of 2018.But Liebrand said there had been a change in the Dutch mindset as electric bikes have moved on from being seen as the choice of older people. “In the future we will not talk about e-bikes, but just bikes,” he said. “E-bikes will be the new normal, I think, within 10 to 15 years. We think that all bikes will be supported by small engines.The RAI Vereniging is pushing for an increase in investment before provincial elections on 20 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a5b26c256a825d87709c003a0eb80b40025f454/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411ec899749c1532d329e8038c436fdb","title":"easter island statues leprosy","story":"White spots eating away at the sculptures are softening them to a clay-like consistency and deforming their featuresWithin a century the emblematic stone figures that guard remote Easter Island could be little more than weathered rectangular blocks, conservation experts are warning – but Britain could be part of the fix.The giant heads, carved centuries ago by the island’s inhabitants, represent the living ancestors of Easter Island’s Polynesian people – the Rapa Nui – and have brought it Unesco world heritage site status in its Pacific location more than 2,000 miles off the coast of Chile.But the hundreds of giant Moai statues dominating the hillsides are facing the threat of what locals ominously describe as a kind of “leprosy” – white spots that are appearing on the figures’ facades.Caused by lichen, the patches are eating away at the sculptures, softening them to a clay-like consistency and deforming their features. The statues must also contend with coastal erosion, rising sea levels that will worsen with climate change, high winds and damage from freely roaming livestock, having withstood the elements for more than half a millennium.“I imagine that in a century more these Moai will basically be rectangular figures,” Tahira Edmunds, the adviser to Chile’s National Forestry Corporation (Conaf), who has worked on cleaning the sculptures to remove the lichen, told Reuters during a visit to the island last month.While the deterioration can appear shocking to visitors to the remote volcanic island, Haoa said it was still possible to save them, through laborious cleaning and coating with sealant chemicals to curb moisture and prevent the porous volcanic rock from collapsing.The most famous Moai groupings, such as the Ahu Tongariki, 15 statues arranged along a platform by the sea, and those scattered around the Ranu Raraku quarry, the source of the stone, are already being cared for by heritage experts and the indigenous community’s administrators of the Rapa Nui national park.But the island has at least 30,000 archaeological sites spread across its 64 sq miles. To protect all the statues could cost as much as $500m, and international help will be needed, according to local authorities and experts.“You will never be able to entirely prevent the impact of time or the weather, but you can hold it back, so that more people can see them first,” Haoa said. Government funding and tourism revenues going towards protection measures have their limitations. But the mayor of Easter Island has come up with an innovative solution: seeking royalty payments from nations whose explorers took some of Easter Island’s statues centuries ago.Among them is the Hoa Hakananai’a, a 7ft (2.13 metres) tall basalt statue at the British Museum, removed from the island by British sailors more than 150 years ago. The Easter Island authorities and the Chilean government sent a delegation to London in November to request the return of the hefty statue. The museum responded that it was happy to consider a long-term loan of the Moai.Mayor Pedro Edmunds Paoa instead suggested the Hoa Hakananai’a could act as an “ambassador” for Easter Island, and Britain could keep it in return for regular payments to ensure the upkeep of its Easter Island counterparts. “We would win much more,” he said.The British Museum said it was looking forward to continuing the “warm, friendly and open” conversation begun in London with a potential visit to Easter Island."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62a227ebd74f9ab16b624c5f74ace73277917282/173_340_2689_1613/master/2689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3fe60dc143005c0941d7843ac4960e5d","title":"huawei china extradition proceedings approved","story":"China has demanded the release of Meng Wanzhou, the company’s chief financial officer, who is in Vancouver under house arrestCanada has approved extradition proceedings against the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, prompting a furious reaction from China.Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei’s founder, was detained in Vancouver last December and is under house arrest. In late January, the US justice department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran.Meng will appear in a Vancouver court on 6 March, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing.“Today, department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms Meng Wanzhou,” the government said in a statement.China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng’s release.Foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a statement on Saturday that Beijing “deplores and firmly opposes the Canadian side’s obstinately moving forward the so-called judicial process”.He said: “This is a severe political incident. We once again urge the US side to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant and extradition request for Ms Meng Wanzhou and urge the Canadian side to immediately release Ms Meng Wanzhou and ensure that she returns to China safe and sound.”Legal experts had predicted the government of prime minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.It could be years, though, before Meng is sent to the United States, since Canada’s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.A final decision will probably come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.Professor Wesley Wark of the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs said “the Canadians will take a beating throughout this whole process” from China.“I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,” he said by phone.Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week, Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.After Meng’s detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.“They’re not going to take this lying down ... one shudders to think what the consequences could be,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faced accusations it had tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.The Canadian justice minister, David Lametti, declined to comment. Huawei was not immediately available for comment.Meng’s lawyers said they were disappointed and described the US charges as politically motivated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c329ab9ce11ce2246279eedae4f028f5500f0bd/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef3eb6fddc6170644570d7fed4193f91","title":"more women in the workplace could boost economy by 35 says christine lagarde","story":"Exclusive: IMF managing director presses for female empowerment in interview to mark International Women’s DayEmploying more women and tackling sexism in the workplace is the key to making the world economy richer, more equal and less prone to devastating financial collapses, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.The IMF’s managing director said she welcomed the success of the #MeToo movement but added that tackling sexual harassment was part of a bigger problem.“I didn’t see #MeToo coming but I welcome it immensely,” Lagarde told the . “Sexual harassment is only scratching the surface. Violence against women is still a massive issue and we are not just talking about low income countries: it is in all societies. It has to be discussed, addressed and fought against. There are some terrible things happening to women.”Lagarde has made female empowerment a key goal for the IMF since joining the Washington-based organisation in 2011, but says she is bracing herself for a backlash against women as a result of the #MeToo campaign.“I worry that firms won’t employ people because of the political risk because they think a women or a minority might cause trouble they will employ somebody else. I have not seen it happening, but it is on my radar.”“Things are changing. There was a time when women in the economy, women in employment, women in finance were not seen as macro-critical. That’s no longer the case.”IMF research, Lagarde said, suggests that banks would be more stable if there were more women on their boards. “What we have observed is that when there are more women the banks’ capital buffers are larger, the number of non-performing loans is smaller and the risk indices are lower. It is not causality but it is a strong correlation.”She said the evidence was that gender empowerment meant “higher growth, a reduction in inequality, an improvement in the strength of the economy and a more ersified, export-focused country”.The severity of the IMF’s financial packages for countries that require help has often been criticised as anti-poor and anti-women, but Lagarde says her organisation tried to keep social protections in place.“In most countries there is a social spending floor under which the authorities are not allowed to go. We have conducted studies on whether health and education budgets have been reduced and found that health budgets have been maintained and education budgets have increased slightly. In some countries, such as Egypt, Jordan, Niger and Mongolia, gender specific policies have been part of the reform package.”Lagarde said that in addition to producing research papers the IMF has started to press member countries to put into action policies that empower women: urging India to improve transport to make it easier for women to get to work and calling on Morocco to change its inheritance laws.Asked who was getting it right, Lagarde said: “In the advanced countries, I would say Austria which is changing its tax laws, and Japan, which has put its money where its mouth is and increased the budget for childcare facilities so that women can take jobs without feeling guilty.”Lagarde says she sees workplace sexism although not directed at herself.“I don’t encounter sexism because I am too old and too tall. It is hard to be sexist towards someone who is older and taller than you.“But I chair meetings at which men and women are present, normally with fewer women than men. Whenever a woman takes the floor there is a general reduction in the attention of men around the table, and sometimes chatting and gossiping amongst themselves.”But some men get the need for change, she said. “Being a feminist is not something that is reserved to women. I know many men who are feminists, who help and struggle to make sure there is no discrimination.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7760493bfd997ab31ffd1e5f53c1ddcf6aae04a8/0_140_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc321420bf7261dc15b9da0b0d2cef7a","title":"tell us how are you marking international womens day 2019","story":"We’ll be telling stories you contribute on 8 March – wherever you are in the world get in touch belowOn Friday 8 March millions of people will be taking part in events to mark International Women’s Day.

Many of them were accused of undermining security and aiding enemies of the state. Some were subsequently released.Those still detained include Aziza al-Yousef, a retired professor at Riyadh’s King Saud University, and Loujain al-Hathloul – who was held in 2014 for more than 70 days for attempting to drive from neighbouring United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia.Some of those detained have faced sexual harassment and torture during interrogation, rights groups and their family members say. Several people with knowledge of their arrest have told the Associated Press that some of the women detained have been subjected to caning, electrocution and others were also sexually assaulted. In February a cross-party panel of three British MPs found the female activists were being detained in cruel and inhumane conditions that meet the threshold of torture under both international and Saudi law.Friday’s statement from prosecutors said “all detainees in this case enjoy all rights preserved by the laws in the kingdom”.But the statement drew sharp criticism from human rights groups.“These women’s rights activists should be released from detention for their peaceful activism not referred to trial,” Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East campaigns director, said. “The Saudi Arabian authorities continue their signature repression.”Michael Page, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said: “The Saudi prosecution is bringing charges against the women’s rights activists instead of releasing them unconditionally. “The Saudi authorities have done nothing to investigate serious allegations of torture, and now, it’s the women’s rights activists, not any torturers, who face criminal charges and trials.”Agence France-Press and Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3809936.1551367040!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate action committee makes progress on decarbonisation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChairwoman  of the Climate Action Committee Hildegarde Naughton TD and  Minister for the Environment Richard Bruton Photograph: Tom Honan for The .Substantial progress has been made by an Oireachtas all-party committee on agreeing major steps to decarbonise Ireland and to implement the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly on tackling climate change.The Committee on Climate Action was set up for a limited term and was due to report by the end of January, but during closed-session meetings over the past month encountered difficulties in reaching a position on increasing carbon taxes.The  understands People Before Profit and Sinn Féin are resisting any increase in carbon tax, which was strongly recommended by the Government’s Climate Change Advisory Council – it would have meant sustained increases in taxes on fossil fuels out to 2030.Their viewpoints are likely to be contained in a minority report set to be finalised by mid March – a motion is to go before the Dáil and Seanad to extend the operational period for the special committee into next year.Tax modelsFine Gael and Green members favour a “fee-and-idend”, whereby tax is returned to householders, while Fianna Fáil favours ringfencing all tax revenue under this heading to support reduction in fossil fuel usage.Both the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton have suggested homes could either be compensated through a “carbon cheque” in the post or by increased welfare payments.In spite of the impasse, members have agreed measures including the following:The committee, it is understood, will not recommend the CCAC be given extensive powers as had been recommended by the Citizens’ Assembly, though it is set to receive extra resources to undertake climate modelling and to continue to advising on best approaches to reducing carbon emissions.Fianna Fáil spokesman on climate action, Timmy Dooley said he was happy with progress in recent weeks though a lot had to be finalised in coming days. “Our view has always been that monies accruing from increased carbon tax are ringfenced for climate measures, to assist people in moving away from carbon,” he added.He believed people saw through the fee-and-idend approach as “being too cute”, which was why his party did not favour it.Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin said his party was prepared to look at carbon pricing options but was opposing the “plastering on of another layer of tax” without affordable alternatives for low- and middle-income households, and small and medium businesses being in place. “It’s not going to work. There are examples of failure from all over the world.”A idend was simply moving money around without providing people with an alternative, he said, such as enabling them to retrofit their homes avail of micogeneration and use renewable energy.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said extending the period for the committee would allow it to feed into the National Energy and Climate Plan, which is due to be submitted to the EU by the end of the year – “by far the most important plan” to be signed off by the Government.It would also allow substantial work to be completed on transport and agriculture including how a carbon tax might be applied in the latter sector as had been recommended by the assembly, as well as addressing forestry and CAP payment issues.He reiterated his party was prepared to be flexible on carbon tax, and would accept a hybrid model, whereby there is a idend combined with use of revenue for specific climate actions.Committee chairwoman, Hildegarde Naughton has indicated she would support a “short, sharp consultation process” to evaluate how the tax would work and to identify challenges in different sectors."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Government\u0026rsquos draft proposals rejected by nurses\u0026rsquo and midwives organisationZappone says Scouting Ireland must implement Tusla\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquourgent\u0026rsquo recommendationsTaoiseach says law to be changed to restore UK-Ireland fishing rightsPeople Before Profit and Sinn F\u0026eacutein are resisting any increase in carbon taxMorgan D\u0027Arcy has been an inpatient at Crumlin children\u0027s hospital for five yearsBallymun Kickhams\u0026rsquo designated site may by needed as depot for rail projectBusinessman loses defamation case against Sunday Business PostSchoolchildren to protest lack of action by adults on climate issues in one-day strikeDeath of David Lynch outside his home in Clondalkin is being investigated as a drug-related murderFundamental internal differences exist about policy, the EU and party leadershipRonan Dunne (20) died after car driven by best friend crashed into pillar near homeScouting Ireland and Tusla representatives invited to appear at Oireachtas CommitteeBoy faces charges of sexual assault, intimidation over two alleged incidentsJohn Murphy had pleaded not guilty to theft from The Children to Lapland AppealReview of defamation laws underway, Leo Varadkar says, in wake of Denis O\u0026rsquoBrien caseSinger was due to perform two dates at Dublin\u0026rsquos Olympia Theatre in at end of MarchOfficer who led shoot-to-kill inquiry in North courageous, single-minded, mourners toldCourt heard driver, who had no experience of driving and no driving licence, fled scene after crash"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3811534.1551470916!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"impounding ni registered fishing boats regrettable varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks to the media following a meeting  with business representatives in Northern Ireland to discuss Brexit. Photograph:  Brian LawlessPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has described the impounding of two Northern Ireland-registered fishing boats seized in Dundalk Bay this week as a “really regrettable incident”.Speaking in Belfast on Friday evening, Mr Varadkar said the arrests on Tuesday of two fishermen, Jack Brown and Kevin Trainor, appeared to be “an accident waiting to happen”.However, he said he was pleased the matter had been resolved without penalty against the two skippers.The pair had been detained after they were observed by the Irish Navy fishing for shellfish in the exclusive 9.6km (6\u0026nbspmile)\u0026nbspIrish territorial limit.Mr Varadkar referred to how the “voisinage agreement”, giving reciprocal access to fishing waters in the North and the Republic, was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2016.“We are going to change that law to restore the status quo to what it was before 2016,” he said. He said he discussed the matter with Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin on Friday and was “confident we can get that legislation through in the next couple of weeks”.“That would allow us to go back to the situation as it was between 1960 and 2016 where Northern Ireland and Ireland allowed each other’s vessels enter the six-mile limit”.Mr Varadkar however said it would be helpful if the British government gave assurances that it would not itself withdraw from the 1964 London Fisheries Convention which incorporates the “voisinage” (neighbourly relations) arrangement.\u0027Zero to do with Brexit\u0027“It would not make sense for us to change our law and only to find that the law had changed in Northern Ireland as well. But that certainly is not a precondition,”\u0026nbspsaid Mr Varadkar.\u0026nbsp“This legislation we are going to get through.”He added: “It would be helpful from the United Kingdom side if they gave us an assurance that they don’t intend to take Northern Ireland out of the London convention because that would just create the same problem North of the border.“But that is not a precondition as far as I am concerned. Fish do not know boundaries they certainly do not know political boundaries and we should be able as good neighbours to allow each other’s vessels fish in each other’s waters.”Mr Varadkar stressed he was not blaming the gardaí or the Navy for the arrests or for “enforcing the law”, and neither was he telling them “not to enforce the law”.Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Michael Creed insisted the incident was “zero to do with Brexit”.Fianna Fáil fisheries spokesman Pat “the Cope” Gallagher confirmed his party, as well as Sinn Féin and other parties would meet Government representatives next week in an effort to resolve the issue.While all agencies involved said it was a routine operation that had no political motive, sources in all the political parties described the timing as unfortunate given the sensitivities around the Brexit process.According to the Department of Defence, 26 fishing boats were detained in Irish waters by the Navy between 2015 and the end of last year, seven of which were UK registered.When Mr Creed tried to restore the “voisinage agreement” in 2017 by introducing the Sea Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to the Seanad, Opposition parties submitted dozens of amendments diluting its impact. Senators from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, the Greens, Labour and Independent David Norris expressed concern the Bill would give unfettered access to any UK vessel of any size to Irish waters, thus seriously depleting fish stocks."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3811573.1551473729!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord winston churchtown feels the pressure","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Minister for Transport (also known as Shane Ross) was invited to the rural transport meeting, and was expected to attend. Photograph: Laura Hutton The  Winston Churchtown. What would we do without him? The Independent Alliance Minister is the gift who keeps on giving. Here’s the latest episode from his jam-packed, busy, busy life as a workaholic Cabinet hotshot legislating in the fast lane and meeting himself coming back because he has so much on his plate going forward.On Wednesday morning, the Oireachtas Committee on Transport met to discuss a burning national issue – rural transport. Representatives of taxi organisations and officials from the National Transport Authority were listed as witnesses. The Minister for Transport (also known as Shane Ross) was invited, and expected, to attend. It is often the case that Ministers can’t make a particular committee meeting due to diary commitments, but an alternative date is usually suggested. Unfortunately, Winston Churchtown had to disappoint the members who had been so looking forward to hearing his views on improving rural transport links and reducing driving test waiting times. And, obviously, it will have been a matter of great regret to the Minister that he couldn’t engage with the likes of Danny Healy-Rae and Michael Cahill from the Rural Independents Group, Fianna Fáil’s Robert Troy, Kevin O’Keeffe and Eamon Ó Cuív and Sinn Féin’s Imelda Munster and Rose Conway-Walsh. They are passionate about rural matters, as is the Minister, a horny-handed son of the Southside who lives in the foothills of the Wickla mountains and tweeted a photograph of himself this week standing beside a tree.But Winston’s absence was unavoidable. His private secretary wrote to the committee – “subject – Rural Taxis+Local Link, Rural Transport Prog” – with the bad news.“I refer to the above and the attached invite to Minister Ross. Unfortunately, due to pressure of work Minister Ross will NOT be able to attend. He is satisfied, however, that the session will be worthwhile as the NTA will be in attendance at the meeting. Regards” etc.Imelda Munster couldn’t believe it. “‘Unfortunately due to pressure of work’,” she repeated, incredulous. “He says he can’t attend, but sure, this is his job!”The TD for Louth got more annoyed about the missing Minister the more she thought about it.“He gave commitments about rural transport and he should be here to answer questions and to be scrutinised,” she told Fergus O’Dowd, the committee chairman. “That’s, that’s actually unreal! ‘Due to pressure of work’. This is his job and he’s made commitments and now he’s transferring his responsibilities over to others. He should be here to answer questions, particularly when rural transport is on its knees.”“Yes, of course, yes, yes,” soothed Fergus, nervously.And then there was the bit about Winston being “satisfied, however, that the session will be worthwhile as the NTA will be in attendance”. Munster was fit to be tied. “He’s the head buck cat. That’s unacceptable. It really is unacceptable. It’s hard to credit that, you know, due to ‘pressure of work’ he can’t be here to answer questions when rural transport is in crisis.”Robert Troy, Fianna Fáil’s transport spokesman, found Winston’s absence unusual because it was the first time he failed to supply an alternative date when unable to attend a meeting. “And he didn’t actually say ‘it’s a clash in the diary’, he said ‘due to work commitments’.”And there the matter might have rested had it not been for a development a few hours later, when the meeting was still going on with rural deputies in full flow. Caught on TVImelda Munster suddenly stopped in her tracks. She looked up at the TV monitor on the wall, then down to the chairman and then back up again to the TV. “Tell me it isn’t an apparition” she cried, picking her jaw off the floor, “and that I HAVE just seen Minister Ross in the chamber on Topical Issues?”Right enough, there on the screen was the deputy for Dublin Rathdown, in all his pomp in the Dáil chamber taking a short “Topical Issues” question from Fine Gael’s Colm Brophy on Dublin’s new BusConnects system, with particular emphasis on Templeogue in windswept and isolated Dublin 6w.Poor Imelda wasn’t the better of it. But it gets worse. After the meeting, as she walked upstairs with Robert Troy, who did they spy only Winston Churchtown, full of smiles and bonhomie and shaking hands to beat the band with a large visiting party of secondary school students and their teachers. “I couldn’t believe it. Shane Ross knew full well that hard questions were going to be asked at that meeting and he had the brass neck not to turn up,” fumed Imelda afterwards. “This is a critical transport issue for so many people who don’t live in urban areas and Shane Ross would rather run off to meet schoolchildren and take a routine topical question than face the committee and discuss rural transport,” said Robert. “It’s a disgrace.”We checked on the elevenses front. The Minister is a creature of habit, from his elevenses in the Members’ Bar to his plate of smoked salmon on brown bread in the same bar at lunchtime. And we hear he was there on Wednesday, just as Robert predicted. It’s not right. Someone will have to stage an intervention before the “pressure of work” becomes too much for overworked Winston.Car park talesMore tales from the Dáil car park, where last week we reported how some TDs like to show off to constituents and friends up in Dublin for the day by getting them free parking in the most exclusive spot in town. Offending politicians drive the cars of pals and family members past the gates (TD and Senators are waved on through, as is their right) and get them inside the Leinster House car park. At the beginning of this week, we spotted Labour Senator Kevin Humphreys making slow progress on crutches around the corridors of power. It turned out he had been involved in a minor car accident a few days earlier and sustained a leg injury. It happened in the Merrion Street car park, right beside the recently installed electric car charging point. Kevin parked his car – a brand new Toyota C-HR – beside it and the hybrid vehicle belonging to Róisín Shortall, his former Labour colleague who now jointly leads the Social Democrats. “I decided, after 35 years driving bangers, to finally buy myself a new car,” he told us. “I was really delighted with it. My first ever new car – only got it three weeks ago. An actual 191 reg.”When he parked in Leinster House a colleague came over to chat and admire the new jalopy. With the engine still running, Humphreys opened the door and leaned out, resting one foot on the ground. The car is automatic. He hit the wrong button. The Toyota lurched forward, the open door swept into his startled and stationary friend and it was forced back onto Kevin’s leg, crushing it. “The pain was terrible. I had to do something immediately. The new car has this keyless ignition – I never had that before – and I went to turn off the engine but hit reverse instead. And with that, it shot back and into the car behind.” There was an unmerciful bang and the shaken Senator limped out to inspect the full damage. “Róisín was very understanding. To be fair to her, she couldn’t have been nicer about it. We exchanged details, but my no claims bonus is gone and I’ve banjaxed my lovely new car. I can’t believe it – a 191 reg and all.”The Sandymount-based Senator, who lost his Dáil seat in 2016, sought medical attention and was told he sustained substantial soft-tissue injury. “I know it could have been much worse. The biggest injury is to my pride, which is badly wounded. I’m absolutely mortified,” he sighed.Christmas dinnerSenators were in flying form this week. They were probably in good humour because it was Christmas. On Tuesday night, Denis O’Donovan, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, hosted his annual Christmas dinner for the Senators who sit in for him as acting chairs. Such was the senatorial social whirl in December, Denis only got around to his own Yuletide bash in February. The leaders of the Seanad’s various political groupings were also invited, while sundry other members wandered in for the feed and weren’t turned away. Also present was Martin Groves, the clerk of the Seanad, and Bridget Doody, the assistant clerk. In true Seanad style, the speeches went on forever. “My God, I think there was at least half a dozen of them,” one Senator told us, trying to erase the memory. They enjoyed dinner and drinks, with Fine Gael’s Joe O’Reilly leading the outpouring of tributes to the popular west Cork Cathaoirleach, who is a very self-effacing and gentlemanly inidual compared with some of the notice boxes he has to put up when in the chair. O’Reilly, a former TD for Cavan-Monaghan, recalled what Denis was like when he arrived in the Seanad in 1989. “A shy kind of fella, great company, who might hide the occasional vodka in his Britvic orange when we were out.” Joe, who is leader of the Irish delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and is vice-president of the Assembly, also spoke of his friendship with Gerry Horkan, the father of the current Fianna Fáil Senator of the same name. “We used to babysit you and change your nappies,” he told Horkan, who must have been delighted to hear that. Other speakers included Jerry Buttimer, the Leader of the House, and Paul Coghlan, the Leas-Cathaorleach. “I must say it was a marvellous occasion,” Reilly told us from Paris yesterday, where he was on Parliamentary Assembly duty. “Christmas is a pretty cluttered time so it was a great idea to have the dinner when there isn’t too much happening. It made the occasion much more enjoyable and everyone had a great time.” Sadly, there were no carols or crackers and the only turkeys were the living ones who roost in the Dáil and Seanad chambers.The Taoiseach was also entertaining this week. Leo Varadkar invited his TDs to Government Buildings on Wednesday night for a bite to eat and a backbench bonding session. He ordered in takeaway, which went down very well with his guests. Not sure if all of them were so keen on his request that they have a good think about Fine Gael and where the party is going. He wanted them to come up with a vision for the future. “Is that not Leo’s job? Is that not why he gets the big bucks and all the photo ops?” snarked one unimpressed attendee afterwards.

His highly influential legal opinion to the Commons in December argued that the UK could become trapped in the backstop for good. “In the absence of a right of termination,” he wrote, “there is a legal risk that the United Kingdom might become subject to protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations ...“In international law, the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding arrangement took its place.”The backstop is the legal guarantee in the protocol to the withdrawal agreement that, should the EU and UK be unable to agree in time a future trading relationship that safeguards the frictionless border in Ireland, the UK will sustain agreed measures to protect it.The focus of the current talks is reportedly a search for a means by which the attorney general could revise his damning opinion and sway key votes on March 12th in support of the withdrawal agreement – crucially without amending the agreement, which the EU insists cannot be reopened.Yet there are provisions in the agreement – specifically a clause on arbitration of disputes – that do directly address those Cox concerns and that, it could be argued, refute persuasively the case made repeatedly by opponents of UK prime minister Theresa May that the EU could indefinitely delay the UK’s departure.Unilateral exitSources in Brussels say that the arbitration provisions are indeed a major focus of Cox’s diplomacy in the search for a “legally binding” assurance. A letter from the EU to London highlighting its provisions, it is argued, may help to do the trick.Sources also suggest that the attorney general is contemplating telling the House of Commons that the explicitly “temporary” nature of the backstop in the agreement would allow the UK to argue that in international law it would be entitled to repudiate the protocol unilaterally if it became clear that the backstop was in fact becoming a permanent fixture.It is not an interpretation of international law that the EU would share and so there can be no question of the union acknowledging such a right, but Brexiteers would certainly cheer Cox’s affirmation of it to the rafters.While the arbitration provisions do not provide either a specific time limit to the backstop or a mechanism for unilateral withdrawal – the sorts of guarantees being sought by the DUP and other critics of May – they do ensure that a decision to suspend the backstop is not ultimately at the sole discretion of the EU and would be timely.Under the agreement a joint committee, co-chaired by the UK and EU, is charged with the “implementation, application and interpretation” of the agreement once in force after the transition period. The protocol to the agreement (article 20) must be reviewed by the Joint Committee at either party’s request within six months, if either considers that it “is no longer necessary to achieve the objectives set out in article 1(3) and should cease to apply in whole or in part”.Should the joint committee be deadlocked on the proposal to suspend the backstop, the matter can be referred to an arbitration panel of five chaired by an independent figure nominated and agreed by both sides.A further difficultyIf Cox is indeed prepared to revise his negative opinion on the basis of a review and an EU public re-endorsement of the arbitration proposals, he may face some continuing difficulties with a key aspect of the protocol review clause. It clearly requires that any review of the backstop can only be contemplated if it “is no longer necessary to achieve its objectives” – the safeguarding of a frictionless border.That is a test the independent arbitrator cannot ignore, and one that points to permanent UK commitments, which it is unwilling to make at present.Although the UK might be willing to sign up now to the withdrawal agreement on the basis of such an interpretation, and get us through the immediate logjam, the central problems with the backstop’s potential permanence do not go away. A new way of kicking the can down the road.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Jack TaylorGetty When Labour MPs walked through the ision lobby at Westminster shortly after 7pm on Wednesday, they knew defeat was certain. But for many of the party’s MPs, members and supporters, losing the vote unlocked a prize they have been pursuing for almost three years: Labour’s backing for a second referendum on Brexit.The amendment, which was defeated by 83 votes, outlined Labour’s plan for Brexit, including a permanent customs union and close alignment with the single market. Two days earlier Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s leader, said that, if his first amendment failed, Labour would be “putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country”.Polls show that about three in five Labour voters favour a second referendum, and support is even higher among the party’s membership. Younger members and those in Momentum, the powerful Corbyn-supporting movement that has emerged as a party within a party, are especially enthusiastic about a vote that could reverse the UK’s decision to leave the European Union.A lifelong Eurosceptic who voted against the United Kingdom’s membership in the 1975 referendum and opposed the Maastricht and Lisbon treaties, Corbyn resisted until this week. In the 2017 general election, Labour promised to respect the previous year’s referendum and to bring together the 52 per cent who voted Leave and the 48 per cent who voted Remain.After Theresa May laid down her red lines ruling out membership of a customs union or the single market, Labour offered a softer Brexit. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, slowly nudged the leadership towards embracing a customs union and, later, a “close relationship” with the single market. But it was an uphill struggle.“Corbyn plus his team of Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy have provided a sort of iron wall of resistance to the pressure applied by Keir Starmer,” says Anand Menon, a professor of European politics at King’s College London who runs the research initiative UK in a Changing Europe.Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions on the soft left of the party, who has been in Corbyn’s shadow cabinet since 2016, has avoided public criticism of the leader and his allies. Last September, he helped to persuade Labour’s annual conference to adopt a Brexit motion mandating support for a second referendum if the party could not win support for its version of Brexit and failed to trigger a general election.Corbyn’s decision to back a referendum last Monday followed a three-hour meeting with Starmer, who later confirmed that the choice on the ballot paper would be between “a viable Leave option” and remaining in the EU.“One interpretation of this is that Jeremy Corbyn has played Brexit brilliantly,” Menon says. “He sort of supported Remain in the referendum but not enough to prevent Leave from winning – which actually, politically, might have suited him quite well. Because I don’t see Corbyn being as popular as he was in 2017 without the referendum, which challenged the existing order and was a sort of revolutionary moment, and that helped Corbyn.“In 2017 he attracted votes from Leave and Remain because he was profoundly ambiguous. Now he’s in a position where he can say, ‘We’re in favour of a referendum, because we don’t support a Tory Brexit – but, actually, I didn’t block Brexit either.’ So he’s hoping to pull off the same trick. I think the elastic is being stretched fairly thin.”The trigger for Corbyn’s decision was the departure a week earlier of eight Labour MPs to form the Independent Group with three disaffected Conservatives. The MPs who left Labour were unhappy with Corbyn’s leadership for a number of reasons, including his handling of anti-Semitism within the party. But their primary motivation was Labour’s approach to Brexit and its failure to back a second referendum, which they all strongly support.Corbyn feared that other MPs would follow the rebels out of the party – a real danger given the lack of support within the parliamentary party for his leadership and the intensification of feeling over Brexit as the endgame approaches.Most MPs welcomed the party’s embrace of a referendum, but some in constituencies that voted heavily for Brexit in 2016, such as Lisa Nandy, who represents Wigan, near Manchester, reacted angrily.“Large numbers of my constituents are now saying they want to vote for no deal at all. And there’s a real problem here, because not listening to people… is frankly what got us here in the first place,” she said. “We’re about to go back and repeat all those same mistakes again. And worse than that, actually, we’re not being clear with people still. You’ve got members of the shadow cabinet, for example, with deep reservations about this, as surprised as anyone to hear this announcement on Monday.”Even after Wednesday’s vote, a number of shadow cabinet members close to the leadership released videos extolling the merits of Labour’s own plan for Brexit. At the same time, left-wing activists in the Another Europe Is Possible group said it was not enough for Labour to vote for a second referendum: it must also campaign for it.John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University and Britain’s leading expert on electoral behaviour, says it was always going to be in Labour’s interest to move towards Remain.“One understands why the Labour Party has tried to keep as many people as possible for as long as possible, because around 30 per cent of its voters voted to leave and 70 per cent voted to remain. But clearly, given those numbers, when forced to choose, then it makes sense for it to be leaning in a Remain direction,” he says.“The way they’re trying to frame it, and thereby trying to keep Labour Leave voters happy, is to say, ‘We want to use the referendum to vote down Mrs May’s deal.’ Labour’s position decoded is: ‘We think that if Mrs May gets her deal through the House of Commons, then she should have to put it to a referendum.’ They’re not saying that ‘if Mrs May cannot get her deal through the House of Commons we will give her a second chance.’ And that’s a crucial distinction, because they are therefore trying to label it as being against a Tory Brexit.”Two out of three Labour MPs represent constituencies that voted Leave in 2016, but Curtice says the statistic is misleading, because even in Leave-voting seats most Labour voters backed Remain. He also questions the argument made by opponents of a second referendum that most of the seats Labour needs to gain in order to win a general election are in heavily pro-Brexit areas.“I think that calculation excludes Scotland and is therefore completely misleading. Remember that virtually every seat in Scotland is marginal between Labour and the SNP, and Scotland is Remain territory. Jeremy Corbyn’s chances of becoming prime minister rest, crucially, on being able to recover in Scotland, and the SNP are competing with him for the pro-Remain vote, because the SNP are in favour of a second EU referendum,” he says.Labour’s support for a referendum is necessary but not sufficient to make it happen given the current parliamentary arithmetic at Westminster. Up to 25 Labour MPs are likely to defy the whip and oppose it, and there is no evidence that the number of Conservatives supporting it would be enough to tip the balance.Labour is expected to table its amendment when May brings her deal back to the Commons for a “meaningful vote” by March 12th, but the party has not yet decided what form it should take. One option is to adopt a version of an amendment drafted by the Labour backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, which offers to support May’s deal on condition that it be put to a confirmatory referendum.“The point about the Kyle-Wilson amendment, which I thought was clever politics, is that the people who have been campaigning for a second referendum have framed it so much as giving people a chance to change their minds, because they were led astray by Boris Johnson et al in 2016, that they’ve turned it into a Remainer cause,” Curtice says.“But the clever thing about the Kyle-Wilson amendment was to say, ‘You know what? We’ll let it through, Mrs May. But then, for it to become law, it has to go to a referendum’.”Campaigners for a second referendum have long believed that their best hope of success will come after all other options have been exhausted. May’s promise to MPs of a vote to extend the article 50 deadline opens up the prospect of the House of Commons seeking a compromise based on a softer Brexit if the prime minister’s deal is rejected a second time.If there is no majority for a softer Brexit, MPs just might opt for a second referendum, but if it were called, how would it turn out?“My current running average is Remain 53, Leave 47, and the polls have consistently shown Remain narrowly ahead for a long time. But much of that lead rests not on people changing their minds but on those who didn’t vote 2½ years ago, who are at least two to one in favour of Remain – at least that’s what they told the pollsters. But will they turn out? Even with them showing up, it’s 53-47, which means the campaign matters. And the Remain side are going to have to figure out an answer to the immigration question,” Curtice says.The prime minister has one further option, which is to call a general election. Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, this requires a two-thirds majority in the Commons, but Labour would almost certainly vote for it. The Conservatives have recently opened up a strong lead in the polls, and Corbyn is now deeply unpopular and has lost all the gains in his personal popularity he made during the 2017 campaign.Conservative MPs will be reluctant to face another campaign with May as their leader, however, and Curtice believes that unless one of the two main parties implodes, Brexit has made it almost impossible for either to make significant gains.“This country is so polarised between those who are ardent Remainers and those who are gung-ho Leavers, and there’s very little ground in the middle. Which is why Mrs May’s deal is struggling with public opinion as well as in the House of Commons. And it’s why the Labour Party’s idea that it’s going to bring the 52 per cent and the 48 per cent together by triangulation is also probably for the birds. Norway, customs union, single market: these are Remainer solutions, and they won’t bring the country together,” he says.“We have politicians who are used to being perennially told that you’ve got to seek the centre ground in politics. There isn’t a centre ground after Brexit. The distribution of attitudes is U-shaped: it’s the extremes that are well populated, not the middle.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This is a New India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, facing a tough election due by May, said Friday.This is an India that will return the damage done by terrorists with interest, he said.India\u0027s junior foreign minister and former army chief, Vijay Kumar Singh, tweeted that the welcome release of the pilot was the first of many steps that #Pakistan must take to reinforce their commitment to peace.Kashmir has been ided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule. Both claim it in full and have fought two wars over the Himalayan territory.India has half a million troops in the part it administers, with militants - backed by Islamabad, according to New Delhi - fighting for independence or a merger with Pakistan.Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, have died since a revolt that broke out in 1989. Last year was the deadliest in a decade with almost 600 killed, monitors say.Matters escalated alarmingly after a massive suicide bombing killed 40 Indian troops on February 14, with the attack claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.Twelve days later Indian warplanes launched a strike inside undisputed Pakistani territory, claiming to have hit a militant camp.An infuriated Islamabad denied casualties or damage, but a day later launched its own incursion across the LoC.That sparked the dogfight which ended in both countries claiming they had shot down each other\u0027s warplanes, and Abhinandan\u0027s capture.Prime Minister Imran Khan unexpectedly announced Thursday that he would be released in the first sign of a potential thaw.Khan alluded to the catastrophic consequences of nuclear war and called for talks - even as he warned India should not take the announcement as a sign of weakness.Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan has become a national hero in India, with his parents receiving a standing ovation as they boarded a flight to welcome their son.Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi meanwhile said he was boycotting a meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held in Abu Dhabi, as India had been invited.The tensions prompted Pakistan to close down its airspace, disrupting major routes between Europe and South Asia and grounding thousands of travellers worldwide.Pakistan\u0027s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said Friday that flights could land and depart from its main airports from 1300 GMT, and that others would be opened gradually.The parents of handlebar-moustached Abhinandan were given a standing ovation by fellow passengers as they boarded a flight to Amritsar near Wagah to welcome their son.He has become a national hero after purported footage that went viral showed him being beaten by locals after being shot down before Pakistani soldiers intervened, with social media abuzz with #GivebackAbhinandan and #Abhinandanmyhero hashtags.His subsequent polite refusal to proffer more details than necessary - I am sorry major, I am not supposed to tell you this - won him particular sympathy in India.His father, a retired air force officer, told the Times of India newspaper, Just look at the way he talked so bravely... a true soldier... we are proud of him.Please review our commenting policyAlka

Air flight when the “scary” episode unfolded.The 24-year-old said: “My friend opened the emergency exit and we slid down the slides, a few old people fell over and the fire brigade treated them.“No-one was seriously injured just minor things.A spokesman for London Stansted Airport said the abandoned takeoff was due to a suspected engine problem.The fire service were sent to assist the evacuation but no-one is believed to have been injured. The spokesman added: There is nothing to suggest there is anything untoward that has happened beside the fact the pilot\u0027s taken the decision to abort the take-off.Please review our commenting policyAlka Seltzer health warning as \u0026#39daily dose\u0026#39 contains as much salt as 20 bags of crisps Comment: Teaching children

Almost since then, discussion has turned to any potential update from Apple, but the company has said very little.When it introduced its AirPower charging mat, it said it would offer a new version of the box the earphones come in so that they could be charged wirelessly, using the mat. But neither the mat or the new box have arrived, leading many to wonder when an update to the AirPods would actually be revealed.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialNow an unconfirmed new rumour suggests that Apple could launch the second version of the AirPods\u0026nbspat the end of this month, on 29 March.\u0026nbspSpanish blog Applesfera\u0026nbspsaid it had seen an internal Apple note that suggested a new version would be released on that date.If the AirPods are released at the end of the month, it could be announced at an event the company is rumoured to be planning for 25 March.

Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true. It was the song Ariana Grande picked to perform at the ‘One Love Manchester’ concert in 2017 for the victims of the terrorist attack. Remarkably, this 20th-century classic, whose melody was composed by Harold Arlen, was almost cut from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, because MGM were worried that the opening Kansas sequence was too long. Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.110 10) “Up Where We Belong (An Officer and A Gentleman, 1982)1982 was a year of blockbuster movie songs and “Up Where We Belong” pipped “Eye of the Tiger” to Oscars glory. Buffy Sainte-Marie, Will Jennings and Jack Nitzsche wrote it for the Richard Gere movie An Officer and A Gentleman. It was sung as a duet after Jennifer Warnes suggested a collaboration with Joe Cocker. Warnes had been a fan of the late Cocker since her teenage years and said she cried out with joy when he accepted the invitation to work with her. Their version was a worldwide hit and also won a Golden Globe and a Grammy.In Swing Time, Fred Astaire sings the gorgeous ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” to Ginger Rogers while she is washing her hair. The sentimental lyrics were written by the brilliant songwriter Dorothy Fields, whose credits include “A Fine Romance” and “The Sunny Side of the Street”. The song, with music composed by Jerome Kern, was up against some terrific competition in 1936 – beating “Pennies from Heaven” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” to an award in its third year. Billie Holiday, with jazz maestro Teddy Wilson on piano, had a hit with “The Way You Look Tonight” that year and the song has since been recorded by hundreds of best-selling singers, including Frank Sinatra. “The Way You Look Tonight” is popular, romantic songwriting at its very best.Sammy Fain’s formal love ballads epitomised the style of movie music in the 1950s. Fain won the Academy award for best song twice – for “Secret Love”, from the 1953 Doris Day movie Calamity Jane and, two years later, with the title song for Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing. Fain, a trained pianist, started out as song promoter in the 1920s and he was pragmatic about delivering the song studio bosses wanted for this William Holden movie. Fain and lyricist Paul Francis Webster constantly tinkered with the words in “Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing” to keep 20th Century-Fox happy. The song, performed by The Four Aces on the soundtrack, has remained a favourite of crooners, from Sinatra to Barry Manilow. The song has also been referenced in numerous modern films, including Grease and Nutty Professor II: The Klumps.410 7) “Can You Feel the Love Tonight?” (The Lion King 1994)In songwriting terms, it was essentially Elton John v Randy Newman in 1994. Newman was nominated for “Make Up Your Mind” for The Paper and John for three songs from The Lion King (his other nominations were for the songs “The Circle of Life” and “Hakuna Matata”). “Can You Feel the Love Tonight”, co-written with Tim Rice, was a popular winner and the single sold 11 million copies. Canadian Céline Dion’s power ballad “My Heart Will Go On”, the theme song to James Cameron’s hit film Titanic, has been bought more than 20 million times. “My Heart Will Go On” is the romantic ballad playing as Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet embrace at the front of the ill-fated liner that crashed into a iceberg. Dion showed great technical skill coping with the tricky modulations of a song written by James Horner and Will Jennings, while the poignant tin-whistle playing is courtesy of Andrea Corr.Top Gun was virtually completed when Tom Whitlock came up with the lyrics to “Take My Breath Away” as he was driving home from work and mulling on a melody Giorgio Moroder had composed. The agreed they had something good and made a demo to play for director Tony Scott. He called back Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis to shoot some new love scenes to go with the new song. “If you see those scenes, you\u0027ll notice that they are lit differently and there are those gauzy curtains blowing around,” Whitlock told rediscoverthe80s “All of that was to disguise that some months had gone by and the actors didn\u0027t look exactly the same.”710 4) “I Just Called to Say I Love You” (The Woman in Red, 1984)In 1984, another year of popular movie title songs (“Ghostbusters” and “Footloose” were in the running), the Oscar went to Stevie Wonder’s “I Just Called to Say I Love You”. Wonder said that he had the late John Lennon in mind for a song he claimed he had first thought of in 1976. “I had the melody and lyric for the chorus, and I imagined in my mind when hearing the chords that The Beatles were singing with me. And that idea and feeling is what inspired me to use the vocoder.” The song was written for the movie The Woman in Red, a mediocre comedy starring Gene Wilder. In 2018, singer-songwriter John Prine recorded a slow, stripped-down version of the song for Spotify Singles, in which he brings out the essential charm of a ballad some find too saccharine. Wonder’s winner was a particular favourite of the writer Maya Angelou810 3) “Moon River” (Breakfast at Tiffany’s, 1961)In Blake Edwards’s film of the Truman Capote novel Breakfast at Tiffany’s, there is a scene in which the love interest Audrey Hepburn sits on the fire escape at a New York apartment and accompanies herself on guitar singing “Moon River”. The scene is charming and the waif-like Hepburn, staying in tune and doing her best with a singing voice that was thin and limited in range, delivers a moving version of a song written for her by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.The film noir Captain Carey, U.S.A, a tale of revenge set in the aftermath of the Second World War that starred Alan Ladd, is regarded now as a dated dud. Its theme tune “Mona Lisa”, sung by Ukrainian jazz trumpeter and bandleader Charlie Spivak, is the surviving glory of the film, however. It became a global hit when it was covered in 1950 by Nat King Cole. Ray Evans wrote the poignant lyrics – “Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa? Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?” – and realised the song, comparing a lover to the famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci, would work as a showcase for Cole’s warm baritone voice. Cole’s splendid version was at No.1 for eight weeks. In the year it won, incidentally, “Mona Lisa” beat the Disney novelty song “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from Cinderella.1010  1) “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” (The Wizard of Oz, 1939)Although “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” is not a straightforward love song, it is a ballad about hope and loving humanity itself, a song that co-writer Yip Harburg called an attempt to “create a rainbow world”, where the dreams you dare to dream really do come true.

Sixteen-year-old Judy Garland’s sublime version, orchestrated by Murray Cutter, wowed cinema-goers and the decision to leave it in was vindicated. Lady Gaga sings a brief section of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Oscar-nominated movie A Star is Born.In the 1850s, he began composing symphonic poems and worked as the conductor of the Gothenburg Philharmonic in Sweden. Over the next decade, Smetana returned to Prague, where his first opera,\u0026nbspBraniboři v Čechách (The Brandenburgers in Bohemia), opened in 1866.A second opera titled\u0026nbspProdaná\u0026nbspNevěsta (The Bartered Bride) followed that same year, bringing success to the composer.Smetana lost his hearing in 1874 as a result of illness (syphilis, per the Encyclopaedia Britannica) but kept working.Between 1874 and 1879, he wrote a series of six tone poems titled\u0026nbspMá Vlast (My Country), which remain known by many to this day.Vltava\u0026nbsp(The Moldau)\u0026nbspembodies Smetana’s love of his hometown and echoes the flow of the\u0026nbspVltava river, also known by its German name Moldau.\u0026nbspTowards the end of his life, Smetana entered a mental health facility in Prague, where he died on 12 May, 1884.In addition to his operas and symphonic poems, Smetana is also celebrated for his highly regarded piano compositions.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Levels of snacking have\u0026nbspincreased. More people are taking lunch boxes into work, rather than buying from sandwich shops or the canteen, because it’s cheaper. The eating out boom of recent years has slowed dramatically.\u0026nbspIt appears that the ‘we’ll be alright if we just keep calm and carry on’ propaganda is being taken with a pinch of salt.\u0026nbspEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcastUK supermarkets lowering standards ahead of Brexit, study showsNo wonder. Kantar makes the point that, according to the Department for Environment, Food \u0026amp Rural Affairs, in 1988 domestic foods accounted for 66 per cent, or two-thirds, of all of what was consumed in Britain. Today, that figure has fallen to 50 per cent, or half.\u0026nbspMuch of the new consumption has arrived from the European Union, from where 62 per cent of all free foods are imported. In the absence of a deal, or a Brexit delay, in less than a month from now the smooth, uninterrupted flow of that food Britain enjoys through its membership of the single market will come to a juddering halt.\u0026nbspThat’s a big problem because while UK consumers may say they like the idea of buying locally, their buying habits speak otherwise. For example, just 41 per cent of the strawberries bought in Britain are consumed during their June, July and August season. The remainder is imported out of season, some from Europe or North Africa, some from further afield.\u0026nbspRetailers have done their best to respond. Range reviews have been conducted. We don’t tend to notice, but they regularly change through the year. They are changing now in ways they don’t usually change. Imported ranges have, for example, been simplified. Tesco has stated that it didn’t return fridges it rented during Christmas. It and Lidl have said that they’ll be hiring extra customs officials to get their produce fast tracked. Investments have been made in software and logistics planning.\u0026nbspMoney has also been spent on beefing up security too. One of the more specious arguments against a second referendum is it would cause social unrest. A no deal would all but guarantee it. It would brutally expose the lies told by Britain’s politicians.\u0026nbspIt would be remiss of me not to note that there will be some positives, and they may persist if Britain avoids the looming cliff edge. They include supermarkets becoming less likely to reject ‘wonky’ or odd shaped veg (although that was already in train) and their efforts persuade shoppers to eat seasonally. Packaging may reduce, and the top to bottom reviews some retailers have conducted of their businesses will serve them well whatever.\u0026nbspHowever, as a palliative these are rather like taking a paracetamol to deal with the after effects of major surgery.Kantar’s report is a superlative piece of work. Its authors, Fraser McKevitt and Ray Gaul, are to be commended.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Overnight, it robbed him of his confidence and his work as a commercial tyre fitter. He became housebound, unable even to make a cup of tea, and so depressed that one evening he found himself on a bridge near his home in Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, Wales, contemplating suicide.\u0026nbspThat was four years ago. Now Mr Ricketts is helping other people suffering from disabilities and loneliness with the Llanelli Visually Impaired Bowls Club. The bowls club has flourished since Mr Ricketts founded it in 2016. This year, they are raising money to attend a national championship in Weston-Super-Mare.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts is also working with the local Men’s Sheds\u0026nbspcharity and\u0026nbspStreet Buddies, a volunteer scheme for residents to get involved in the community. For some of this work, he is paid in time credits, a form of community currency that can be exchanged for tickets to concerts and access to parks and leisure centres.“It’s given me a real boost,” he says. “It’s a way to pay people for help without using money and it makes me feel really good, because I’m giving something back.”What is Venezuela’s new currency system?The stock exchange for goods and skills in GlasgowTime credits in the UK are issued by Tempo (formerly known as Spice). The charity was founded in 2008 at the the Wales Institute for Community Currencies. In their original form, time credits were an experiment to help rebuild\u0026nbspthe ex-mining communities of south Wales.Time credits offer an alternative way to reward work that is traditionally unpaid at a time when local authorities are relying on communities to step in and provide care for the lonely and vulnerable. They should never replace paid work, but time credits\u0026nbspmight give meaning or value to an exchange with a person with disabilities, mental health or addiction issues who could struggle to take part in the monetary economy.\u0026nbspIn times of crisis, such as in Argentina at the turn of the millennium or during the Greek financial crisis, barter economies and community currencies can facilitate exchanges between people when the monetary economy fails. \u0026nbspSome 50,000 people have since earned 700,000 time credits since 2008. Mr Ricketts says the scheme has huge potential in areas of low income by helping community groups give back to volunteers. Families awarded time credits can use the scheme to take advantage of daytrips and leisure activities that might otherwise be beyond their reach.\u0026nbsp“I have seen the potential of them for families with low incomes,” he says. He has been known to give some of his own time credits to people when he sees them counting the pennies to buy a cup of tea.\u0026nbspMr Ricketts always keeps some time credits in his pockets. Given his condition, that can cause confusion. “They look and feel like the new plastic fivers,” he says. “Because I can’t see I have been known to try and pay for a pint with time credits in the pub.”Similar schemes around the UK encourage people to swap their time or labour for time in kind. In Hull, the HullCoin rewards people for getting involved in community action with a digital currency that can be used to get discounts with local businesses. Many cities also have a time-banking network co-ordinated by Timebanking UK. Time-banking is rooted in the idea that every person has something to contribute to their community, regardless of their circumstances.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Ian Merrill worked in health and social care for 20 years before he became the chief executive of Tempo in 2017. He says time credits are a way to enable people like Stephen Ricketts to take a role in their community by recognising the efforts that go into volunteering. The scheme also gets new people into volunteering. Half of people earning time credits have have volunteered before.“People volunteer for its own sake and that’s fine,” Mr Merrill says. “But we know that time credits bring people into volunteering who wouldn’t already do it.”\u0026nbspMr Ricketts says he uses time credits at bowls to thank personal assistants for extra jobs, like making a round of tea, putting out biscuits for the players, or cleaning up afterwards. “After a bit of time, I found out the assistants had children and they were taking them swimming, so when they wanted to take their family out to a leisure part or a theatre, I gave them the time credits to cover it,” he says.Volunteers can currently spend their time credits golfing at Pembrey Park in Wales, learning to paddleboard in Essex, or on hair and beauty treatments at participating salons. They can also be exchanged for short courses at some college and classes to learn how to act or how to cook healthier meals.Simon, whose last name is withheld, earned his first time credits with the Haringey Project, which helps people with mental health problems or substance misuse. He earned credits volunteering with gardening when he lived in St Mungo’s Hostel for two years. With the credits he earned, he took his mother on outings to Tower Bridge, Keat’s House and Kensington Palace.\u0026nbspWhat really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?“I’ve taken my mum to places she’s never been to before,” he says. “I went on lots of trips with time credits this August, it was the best August of my whole life.”Tempo is now looking at harnessing technology to bring time credits to more people. Mr Merrill says time credits could become ever more important in the UK during tightened economic circumstances. “Time credits enables people to address needs in their own communities,” he says. “If they can help unlock capacity and create connections that weren’t there before, those are good things.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right.

CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHBy 1963, when the group disbanded, The Springfields\u0026nbsphad had a series of hits and pre-empted the “British invasion” that would see The Beatles, The Kinks et al take the US by storm.In November that year, Dusty Springfield went solo and was free to pursue her own ideas, drawing influence from R\u0026ampB girl groups like The Exciters, whose\u0026nbsphit “Tell Him” is a clear blueprint for her orchestral-pop sound.Her first single “I Only Want to Be With You” was a smash, as was the album that followed it, A Girl Called Dusty (1964). The record’s highlights included\u0026nbspcovers of Lesley’s Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me”, The Shirelles’ “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” and Ray Charles’s “Don’t You Know?” as well as her first collaborations with Burt Bacharach and Hal David: “Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa” and “Anyone Who Had a Heart”.Further Bacharach-penned\u0026nbspsingles would follow: “Wishin’ and Hopin’” and ”I Just Don’t Know What to Do With Myself”.By now, Dusty was an established star, her only serious rivals on the UK scene Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and Lulu, after whom she jokingly named her three beehive wigs.But there were controversies: she was deported from South Africa for playing for an integrated audience and\u0026nbspdeveloped a reputation for being difficult after throwing a cake at an objectionable waiter.She also suffered the indignity of being knocked out of the Italian Song Festival in San Remo\u0026nbspat the semi-final stage in 1965, a competition that would\u0026nbspinspire Eurovision. However, she heard an Italian ballad,\u0026nbsp“Io Che Non Vivo (Senza Te)”, sung by its composer Pino Donaggio\u0026nbspat the same event that would provide the biggest hit of her career when translated into English: “You Don’t Have to Say You Love Me”.A skilled interpreter of songs, Dusty Springfield was also an influential tastemaker in the Swingin’ Sixites, sometimes credited with bringing the Motown sound to British TV audiences for the first time\u0026nbspwhen she curated a special edition of the ITV\u0026nbspprogramme Ready Steady Go! that\u0026nbspfeatured Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, The Temptations and The Miracles.A Life in Focus: Dusty SpringfieldWhile a single\u0026nbsplike “The Look of Love” brilliantly captured its moment, Springfield nevertheless faced\u0026nbspcriticism for being\u0026nbspinauthentic and adopting American tropes, an ersatz Nancy Sinatra.To address this, she signed with Atlantic Records – home of her heroine, Aretha Franklin – and relocated to Tennessee in 1968 to record Dusty In Memphis.Despite featuring “Son of a Preacher Man” and “The Windmills of Your Mind” (Michel Legrand’s\u0026nbsppsychedelic theme for The Thomas Crown Affair)\u0026nbspand songs by Bacharach and David, Carole\u0026nbspKing and Gerry Goffen\u0026nbspand Randy Newman, the record was a commercial flop but has since gone on to be recognised as one of the greatest albums of all time.The disappointment was to mark the beginning of the end for the singer. The 1970s were marked by a steady decline in interest in her records, a period that coincided\u0026nbspwith an increase in tabloid prurience\u0026nbsptowards her personal life after she revealed her bisexuality in an interview with Ray Connolly of The Evening Standard to promote her single “How Can I Be Sure?”Reappraised\u0026nbsptoday, her remarks are startlingly frank and brave indeed:\u0026nbsp“I don’t go leaping around to all the gay clubs but I can be very flattered. Girls run after me a lot and it doesn’t upset me. It upsets me when people insinuate things that aren’t true. I couldn’t stand to be thought of as a big butch lady. But I know that I’m as perfectly capable of being swayed by a girl as by a boy. More and more people feel that way and I don’t see why I shouldn’t.”“Do you realise... what I’ve just said could put the final seal to my doom. I don’t know, though. I might attract a whole new audience,” she told Connolly.Springfield relocated to America to avoid the subsequent furore but struggled\u0026nbspto fit in with the suburban social milieu of Los Angeles. She was rescued from obscurity by The Pet Shop Boys in 1987 to duet with Neil Tennant on “What Have I Done to Deserve This?” before being diagnosed with breast cancer in the mid-Nineties and passing away at her home on Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.After a funeral attended by hundreds of fans – Elvis Costello, Lulu and Tennant\u0026nbspamong them – her brother and former bandmate, known as “Tom Springfield” ever since, scattered her ashes over the Cliffs of Moher in Ireland.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the problem with negative Ofsted judgements is that they stigmatise schools making it more difficult for them to improve.“What these schools need is targeted support and an inspection system which is less stark.”Nick Gibb, school standards minister, said: “This government is determined to create more choice for parents when it comes to their children’s education and we have created 825,000 school places since 2010, and are on track to see that number rise to a million by 2020.“Standards have also risen, with 86 per cent of schools now good or outstanding, compared to 68 per cent in 2010, and last year more than nine out of ten pupils got a place at one of their top three choices, setting them on the path for a successful future.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Actually, it’s a two-man show: most of the landscape paintings in this exhibition are by David Hockney, but they’re juxtaposed with landscapes by one of his great artistic heroes: Vincent van Gogh.“He’s one of the great, great draughtsmen of all time,”Hockney, fielding questions from a crowd of journalists, who’ve flown in from all around the world. “The drawings are fantastic – he could see space very clearly.” And the paintings are something else. “Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really look.”Hockney is wearing a natty flat cap and a lime green cardigan – he’s always been a stylish dresser. He seems cheerful and contented – he’s always been comfortable in his own skin. However he looks older and frailer than he did a few years ago, and he talks a lot more slowly. This should come as no surprise – he is 81, after all – but somehow it’s still a shock. With his boyish good looks, he was the Peter Pan of Pop Art. Even in late middle age, he seemed a lot younger than his years. Now he finally looks his age, but we should be thankful he’s still alive and still painting. If Van Gogh had lived as long as Hockney, he would have still been alive in the 1930s.“I’ve been deeply influenced by Van Gogh – it’s very visible in this show,” he says. “Van Gogh, to me, is a contemporary artist. Any artist that speaks to you is a contemporary artist. Brueghel is a contemporary artist to me.” Another big influence in his life has been Van Gogh’s letters to his brother Theo. “They’re marvellous,” he says. “If it had been 10 years later he might have been on the phone and the letters wouldn’t exist.”Hockney’s first encounter with Van Gogh was back in 1955, when he was a student at Bradford School of Art. The art school arranged a trip to a Van Gogh exhibition in Manchester, and Hockney was blown away by the energy, the vitality, the joie de vivre of his paintings. “I was 16 years old and I’d just started at the art school,” he recalls. “I thought, ‘Well, he’s quite a rich artist, because he could use two whole tubes of blue to paint the sky’. Not even teachers at the art school could afford that!”Created with Sketch.David Hockney\u0027s first brushes with genius Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)Hockney (right) at the Walker Art Gallery with Sir John Moores in 1967‘Cold Water About to Hit the Prince’ (1969)‘Peter Getting Out of Nick’s Pool’ (1966)Hockney’s entry form for the 1967 John Moores Painting Prize‘Cleanliness Is Next to Godliness’ (1965)It was the colour that moved him most of all. “I’d never seen paintings like that before – at the art school everybody just painted grey pictures of Bradford. There was not much colour at all. At first I thought he’d probably exaggerated some colour, but now I don’t think so.” Sixty-four years later, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, which holds the world’s largest collection of Van Gogh’s work, has had the bright idea of juxtaposing a large array of Hockney’s Yorkshire landscape paintings with a smaller selection of Van Gogh’s landscapes, painted in the 1880s in the south of France. Hockney is flattered by this association. “Van Gogh is a terrific inspiration.”Of course there are some similarities between Van Gogh’s woods and wheat fields and Hockney’s, but this show isn’t about narrow comparisons, of style or subject matter. It’s about their shared love of light. Above all, it’s about their lust for life. They’re both artists who adore the natural world, and paint it compulsively. “They’re just so joyful,” he says, of Van Gogh’s landscapes. You could say the same of his. Fittingly, the show is called The Joy of Nature.As Hockney says, it’s a far better title than Dave and Vince. It’s ironic that such joyful paintings were made by a man who chose to kill himself, but that paradox is part of what makes Van Gogh so compelling. “He was joyful when he painted – I know that, because that’s what he loved.”‘Kilham to Langtoft II’, 27 July 2005, oil on canvas (David Hockney)This exhibition also represents a kind of renaissance, for Hockney’s landscape paintings, like Van Gogh’s, were cut short by a tragic, self-inflicted death. In March 2013, one of Hockney’s assistants, Dominic Elliott, died from drinking toilet cleaner in Hockney’s home in Bridlington, the Yorkshire seaside town where Hockney had been living intermittently since the early Noughties. Hockney was entirely blameless, but he’d been asleep in the house when it happened, and the shock was immense. He sold the house and moved back to Los Angeles, his adopted home for the past 30 years. For several months, he was unable to paint at all.In July 2013 Hockney sent a picture to his friend and curator Edith Devaney. It was a portrait of his close friend and studio manager, Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima, sitting in Hockney’s LA studio, his head buried in his hands. Straight away, Devaney spotted the similarity with Van Gogh’s Old Man in Sorrow. This wasn’t just a portrait, Hockney told her – it was also a sort of self-portrait.This portrait led to many more, and the result was his 2016 exhibition, 82 Portraits and One Still Life, at London’s Royal Academy, curated by Devaney. After the trauma of Elliot’s sudden death, Van Gogh helped to bring Hockney back into painting. And now Van Gogh has brought his Yorkshire landscapes, cruelly curtailed by that tragic accident, back to life.Van Gogh is telling us that there’s a marvellous world in your own back garden. You just have to look at it – really look. I think that’s his message. It’s thrilling if you really lookThe selection was mainly made by the Van Gogh Museum, but Hockney did ask them to include The Road to York through Sledmere, which he painted a decade earlier, as homage to his friend Jonathan Silver. Silver revived Salts Mill in Saltaire, Yorkshire, as a cultural centre (and as a museum of Hockney’s work). He died of pancreatic cancer in 1997, aged just 48. When Silver was very ill, Hockney spent a lot of time with him.He asked Silver if there was anything he could do for him. Silver asked him to paint east Yorkshire – a subtler landscape than West Yorkshire, where Hockney was born and raised. “That picture was painted when Jonathan Silver was dying, and I was driving constantly from Bridlington to Saltaire, and I always went through Sledmere,” remembers Hockney. “It’s always been on my wall.”English landscape paintings are often muted, a blur of browns and greys. Hockney’s English landscapes are glowing – bursting with bright colours and brilliant light. “I’d lived in California for 30 years. It’s bound to have an effect. But I don’t think I exaggerated the colour that much – no, I don’t think so. I think it’s there, but you have to look – hard. Colour is a very fugitive thing.”As he says, we all see colour differently. Some people see it more intensely. Hockney’s intense vision makes us look closer and the world look brighter. “When you’re looking at the world, there’s so much to see.”David Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937, the fourth of five children. During the war his father Kenneth was a conscientious objector, which meant that when he lost his job, as a clerk, he wasn’t eligible for national assistance. He subsequently scratched a living renovating old prams. David drew from an early age, in chalk on the kitchen floor and in pencil in his brothers’ comics.In 1947 he won a scholarship to Bradford Grammar School. He didn’t shine at school, which was just as well. If he’d been top of the class his teachers might have pushed him into a more respectable occupation. “He should realise that ability in and enthusiasm for art alone is not enough to make a career for him,” wrote his teacher on his school report.Fortunately for Hockney, and the rest of us, he paid no attention to his teachers. He went to Bradford College of Art, which gave him a solid foundation in skills like life drawing, then on to the Royal College of Art, in London, where he found his voice. He came out as gay – a brave move in an era when homosexuality was still illegal – and his work blossomed. He made his first visit to America, and returned with his hair dyed blonde, after seeing a TV ad for Clairol which claimed that “blondes have more fun”.By the time Hockney left the Royal College he was already represented by a Bond Street gallery. He moved into a two-room flat in London’s Notting Hill, still a rundown area back then. He slept in one room and used the other room as his studio. His immense talent was bolstered by his insatiable appetite for hard work. GET UP AND WORK IMMEDIATELY was painted in big block capitals on the chest of drawers at the foot of his bed.His first solo show in 1963 earned him enough money to spend a year in America. As he told his friend Henry Geldzahler, he never felt lonely over there. He spent some time in New York but he was drawn to Los Angeles, where he’s lived, off and on, ever since.“Southern California has a marvellous clarity in the light. That’s why Hollywood is there. I always loved the place. I never got bored of it.” The sun-drenched pictures he painted there would have been inconceivable in Britain. “In a cold place like Bradford you hardly see anybody without their clothes on,” he once remarked.Hockney painting ‘May Blossom on the Roman Road’, 2009 (Jean-Pierre Goncalves de Lima)Then as now, LA is commonly derided by snobbish Brits (and New Yorkers) as a spiritual desert, devoid of culture, but Hockney saw a vivid, lively cityscape that no one else had painted, a city with “the only architecture in the world that makes you smile”. He took to calling himself an “English Los Angeleno”. He vowed to become the “Pirinesi of LA”.His LA paintings made his name, in Britain and America, particularly his swimming pool pictures like A Bigger Splash and Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), which last year became the most expensive painting by a living artist when it sold at Christie’s in New York for $90m (£68m).David Hockney interview: \u0027I thought I was a peripheral artist, really\u0027“The auction prices for my work have nothing to do with me – I ignore it,” he says, emphatically. “I think people have forgotten Oscar Wilde’s remark, ‘The only person who likes all kinds of art is an auctioneer’.”He’s worked in all kinds of media, from film and photography to set design. He’s embraced every new innovation, from fax machines to smartphones. His iPad paintings were groundbreaking, proving that this new medium could be a new way to make great art.“The first things I did were lots of sunrises from a window, and I realised that with the iPad I could draw without moving from my bed. I didn’t have to get up to get water, or a brush, or pencils, and I could draw in the dark, because of the back light, so I started drawing just before the dawn.” He painted dozens of pictures of the sun rising, on his iPad, through the same bedroom window. “Every day was different, different colours. No two sunrises are the same.”Woldgate’, 2008, oil on 2 canvases (David Hockney)Yet despite his love of hi-tech, he’ll always be remembered as a painter, and a traditional painter at that. “Modern art generally ignores skills and crafts,” he once said, in an interview with Art Monthly. When abstract art was all the rage he flew the flag for figuration. When conceptual art was all the rage he flew the flag for fine art.“There’s a lot of the boring old northern art schoolmaster in what he says about representation versus abstraction,” wrote Tim Hilton, in . But as a new generation of artists rediscover draughtsmanship, it seems Hockney has been proved right.Despite his conventional views on art, he’s no reactionary fuddy-duddy. He was a tireless advocate for gay rights, long before such causes became chic. His friend Henry Geldzahler once wrote down a list of his faults and failings: stubborn hard of hearing unintentionally rude suffers fools gladly generous to a fault. It’s notable that several of these faults are actually virtues.It’s hard to find an artist who’s so universally admired. And after all these years, his hunger for experience remains. “On Saturday I’m going off to Normandy to paint the arrival of spring,” he says. “I can’t think of anything better than watching the spring happen in Normandy in 2019.”Hockney – Van Gogh: The Joy of Nature is at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (vangoghmuseum.nl) until 26 MayWe’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.After the sudden death of his wife, search and rescue commander John West relocates with his three kids to his rural hometown of Turtle Island Bay.In the world’s toughest cricket league, every game is a battle.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise.

An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A new season of hilariously zany adventures for larva pals Red and Yellow includes an invasion of their island!YooHoo to the Rescue\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFive cuddly pals from the magical land of YooTopia use teamwork and special gadgets to help animals in trouble and make new friends along the way!Loveable, hilarious Charlie leads you on unpredictable and imaginative shape-filled story expeditions alongside a colourful cast of characters.Snow White \u0026amp the HuntsmanCreated with Sketch.Best films on Netflix Show all 28Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Netflix\u0027s recommendation algorithm is pretty sophisticated these days, to the point where it can probably determine not only what you want to watch next, but what you\u0027ll eat for breakfast 13 years on Wednesday and the thread count of your sheets. 328 The Wolf of Wall Street(2011.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightOral-B does already have a toothbrush that relies on some smart features: the Genius. That too operates as a brushing coach as well as a brush itself, watching how you clean your teeth and encouraging you to avoid bad habits and ensure your entire mouth is brushed.Scientists developing toothbrush to diagnose deadly heart problemsTo know where it is, the toothbrush uses built-in sensors that build on a host of experimental work to understand how people brush. The company put huge numbers of people in front of a camera and asked them to brush, feeding that information into an algorithm that allows the toothbrush to know where it is, no matter which of the widely varying ways of brushing their teeth that people use.But it does so using your phone\u0027s camera, meaning that you have to stick a special holder\u0026nbspto your mirror and then stick your phone inside. When it\u0027s there, it can watch the brush as it moves around in your mouth, monitoring where exactly you are brushing and where needs extra work.That is a rather complicated process that requires a fairly complicated process just to brush your teeth, and might not always work if the phone doesn\u0027t have the right view. Instead, the Genius removes some of that: it just needs to be within Bluetooth distance of your phone, and then will relay information that is displayed on your handset.In the app – which was available to use at MWC, in a booth that let visitors brush their teeth – all of that information is displayed. Brushers are given a score, which factors in whether they press too hard and how long they brush for as well as how effective and complete their coverage was.Over time, people are encouraged to improve that score by better brushing their teeth.

At the same time, our toxic air in London is a major public health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children, leading to thousands of premature deaths and increases the risk of asthma and dementia.“Most other motorists, from private cars to small business owners, are liable for the Congestion Charge.

according to a legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag.The conclusion came amid fresh evidence that the exit talks remain in trouble, with a lack of progress that might persuade MPs to approve the prime minister’s deal.The controversy over European elections is crucial\u0026nbspbecause Ms May told MPs a delay to June would be possible without a U-turn on withdrawing MEPs – if parliament

exit mechanism from the Irish border backstop, which the EU has rejected, it was reported.On Tuesday, Ms May – while insisting she remained opposed to delaying Brexit – told MPs: “An extension beyond the end of June would mean the UK taking part in the European Parliament elections.”However, the legal opinion warned of “a violation of the active and passive voting rights of British nationals” if there was a delay beyond 23-26 May, when the elections are held.Leave supporters to pay £50 to join Nigel Farage on Brexit marchEurotunnel settles Brexit ferry contract dispute for £33mLiam Fox mocked for spending £107,000 on Brexit podcast“British citizens living in the UK would be denied a fundamental right conferred on them by citizenship of the European Union,” the German paper Die Welt quoted the advice as saying.They could take action in UK courts “in defence of their rights to vote and stand for election … in accordance with applicable national rules”.And EU citizens in the UK would also be prevented from “exercising their right to vote and stand in elections to the European parliament in their state of residence”, laying Britain open to possible action by the European Commission.The European Court of Justice could issue a preliminary ruling on “whether or not Britain’s non-participation in the European elections is legally permissible”.It is increasingly plausible that the EU will insist on a much longer extension – possibly 21 months, to allow a trade deal to be agreed while the UK is a member, avoiding the backstop controversy.This week, Emmanuel Macron hinted at that approach when he said France would block a Brexit delay unless it had a “clear objective” based on a “new choice” by the British.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The prime minister told MPs that if the next “meaningful vote” on the withdrawal agreement is defeated, then they will have the chance to vote for an extension of Article 50, thus\u0026nbspdelaying Brexit.Some Brexiteers –\u0026nbspfearing a lengthy delay to the exit process – may decide to climb down, even though their fundamental objection to the backstop remains.Still, plenty of pro-Brexit\u0026nbspMPs still argue the backstop must be time-limited, or replaced in its entirety. On balance, it seems likely that most\u0026nbspwill vote down the deal again, unless Ms May obtains significant concessions in the next fortnight.With no breakthrough in sight as Ms May’s officials\u0026nbspcontinue discussions with their counterparts in Brussels, it\u0026nbspremains an extraordinary (and probably\u0026nbspunlikely)\u0026nbsptask for the prime minister to overturn the biggest defeat in the modern British political history and secure MPs’ backing for her Brexit deal.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

It looked to be a straight-forward victory for the Spaniard as he surged into a two-set lead, but Murray is not a three-time Grand Slam champion for nothing and he supremely levelled the match despite hobbling around the court from the get-go.

Struggling to hold back tears, the 31-year-old Scot said that the continuing pain from what he described as his “severely damaged right hip” had led him to decide to end his career this year. He said that he had been planning to make this summer’s Wimbledon his farewell tournament, but feared that he might have to bring down the curtain before thenThe multi-pound bungler has wasted £2.7bn of taxpayers money that could have gone to cash strapped local councils, hospitals and schools. Yet no matter how many mistakes he makes or how much public money he squanders, he remains in post.\u0026nbspMr McDonald attributes £2bn of the money\u0026nbspto the collapse of the Virgin Trains east coast franchise in 2018 and the decision of the government to take the route back into public ownership.The party said a\u0026nbspfurther £437m\u0026nbspcould be attributed towards his prison probation service reforms while £72,000 was spent on unsuccessfully defending a policy of restricting books being sent to prisoners.In response to Labour\u0027s analysis, a spokesman for Mr Grayling, however,\u0026nbspsaid: “In the old days Labour used to do properly sourced attacks rather than ad hominem nonsense based on a hodgepodge of half-truths and made-up drivel.“The only truth we’ve had out of Labour in the last decade is a note saying \u0027there is no money left\u0027 after the crashed the economy leaving Britain with a £120 billion annual budget deficit and soaring unemployment.Here The Independent looks at some of Mr Grayling\u0027s most contentious policies\u0026nbspwhile in government - and the cost.In 2013, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) embarked on major reforms of probation services - known as Transforming Rehabilitation.\u0026nbspAccording to a fresh report from the National Audit Office into those services, it was found that the number of criminals being sent back to prison for violating licence conditions has increased since the government\u0027s dangerous part-privatisation of the service.\u0026nbspThe head of Whitehall\u0027s spending watchdog, Sir Amyas Morse said the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) had set itself up to fail as Chris Grayling - then head of the department - had ignored warnings over contracting out the supervision of criminals.These have had far-reaching consequences, he added. Not only have these failings been extremely costly for taxpayers, but we have seen the number of people on short sentences recalled to prison skyrocket.\u0026nbspAccording to the NAO, problems with the system mean the MoJ is to pay at least £467m more than was required under the original contracts.On the same day the NAO released it\u0027s damning report, it was announced that Eurotunnel had dropped its legal claim against the government over post-Brexit ferry contracts - after ministers agreed to pay out £33m to the firm.The challenge was launched by the company as it claimed the government\u0027s lucrative contracts to increase cross-Channel capacity in the event of a no-deal scenario - totalling £108m - had been doled out in a distortionary and anti-competitive way.\u0026nbspDowning Street said the decision to pay out to Eurotunnel was a cross-government one, but the Department for Transport (DfT) took the lead on the ferry contracts, and was at the centre of a storm recently when one of the firms awarded a contract, Seaborne Freight, did not actually have any ships. The contract was worth over £13m, but the money was never spent.Books for prisoners\u0026nbspIn 2014, Mr Grayling\u0027s restrictions on sending books to prisoners in England and Wales was declared by the High Court to be unlawful - and was eventually overturned by his successor, Michael Gove, the following year.But in an attempt to defend the ban, Mr Grayling spent £72,000 of taxpayers\u0027 money in the courts, which at the time was described as a scandalous waste of public money.\u0026nbspWhile justice secretary, Mr Grayling also awarded a £23m contract to a firm for a bespoke prisoner tracking scheme to give Britain one of the most advanced GPS tagging systems in the world.Unfortunately for Mr Grayling, this was another policy overturned by Mr Gove and the vast majority of the money had already been spent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Whether it is true or not, some people certainly perceive that it means that the British government listens more to the DUP than to other parties.“We see for example that Fianna Fail has decided to create a similar partnership with the SDLP, which could create a similar dynamic were they to re-enter government south of the border.”Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

But Labour’s more paralysing fear is more Remainer MPs abandoning the party. They have clearly decided to throw their Leavers under the bus.The party is now in desperate straits.It’s not just Brexit. For years it has rubbished claims that it has been over-run by racist anti-Semites and rabidly hard-Left conspiracy lunatics. Now ­Corbyn’s ally Jon Lansman, founder of Momentum, admits that it’s all true.“We have a major problem,” he says. “It is obvious we have a much larger number of people with hardcore anti-Semitic opinions... polluting the atmosphere in constituency parties and online.”Deputy Leader Tom Watson is in open revolt, launching a “party within a party” to prevent more moderates defecting.It may be too late. Corbyn’s own anti-Semitic extremism attracted all the racists and cranks who have forced out one Jewish MP and her colleagues. All the while he has faced both ways on Brexit.If he is about to pay the price for it all, it is well deserved.FOR too long we have allowed the supporters of terror to wave their sickening flags during protests on our streets.Enjoying free speech protections, they have spread the lies and vicious hatred of one of the world’s most violently anti-Western and anti-Semitic groups.Police have had to let goons march through London with Hezbollah banners emblazoned with an assault rle.Tory Home Secretary Sajid Javid has outlawed them entirely. Supporters could get ten years in jail.The Sun applauds him.Ours is a famously tolerant country.It will not stay that way unless we get tougher on those aiming to destroy it.YOU don’t normally achieve full “national treasure” status at just .But Olivia Colman — of Peep Show, Broadchurch, The Favourite and many more — did so even before she bagged her magnicent Best Actress Oscar.We all love a British winner.But who couldn’t warm to one so charming, down-to-earth and plain fun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no longer.In recent months Big Ben has stood silent. Officially, it has been muted for repairs but you could not be blamed for wonderingthere was a dferent reason.Has this most resonant symbol of parliamentary democracy been gagged — had its clacker nicked — while our appalling, promise-shredding, treasonous politicians plot to overturn the  referendum’s whacking vote to leave the European Union Almost three years ago the voters gave MPs a clear instruction: Get us out of the EU. Unbelievably, the MPs are refusing to obey.Whatever tricksy waffle they spout, be in no doubt about this. The parliamentary class is telling voters to get stuffed.The last  hours have seen British politics sink to a new, squalid, guttering low.In clear daylight the express will of the people is being violated.Democratic honesty is being casually abandoned by a knot of pro-Brussels obsessives who think they can do whatever they like. And they suppose we won’t notice!Cabinet ministers yesterday tarted their Remainer consciences like dollybirds flashing their bits on Blackpool beach.Led by Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, they threatened to resignTheresa May did not do their bidding and delay our departure date from Europe.Oooh, look at us, their blatant behaviour said. Look at our importance and our Europhile goodness. All this while they accused pro-Brexit MPs of being “extremists”.Is it really extremist to respect the biggest vote in British history In any normal circumstances, a Prime Minister would have turned to Rudd and her fellow drama queens Greg Clark and David Gauke and said: “OK, resign. If you won’t support the Government, you can kiss goodbye to your six-figure salary, your free limos and all the other perks.”But Mrs May, pitiably weak, tolerated their rebellion and trotted off to the Commons to accept Brexit may be delayed.It wasn’t just Rudd, non- entity Gauke and Clark, a former SDP supporter who has resented the Leave vote from day one.A trio of lower-ranking ministerial numpties put their names to a newspaper article saying they would quit unless Mrs May obeyed their pro-EU agenda.These connivers included an insufferably moist specimen called Richard Harrington, who is barely a familiar name in his Watford constituency let alone in national politics.Even a premier as puny as Mrs May should have had the backbone to tell Harrington to fetch his coat. But no. He was allowed to keep his job.Things are just as bad in the Labour party, where ­Jeremy Corbyn has casually scrapped his  manesto promise to respect the result of the EU referendum.Now he says he wants a second referendum. You thought the one thing loonytunes Corbyn had going for him was that he said what he believed A manesto should matter. It should be a solemn undertaking to the voters about what politicians will do.But Corbyn, supposed beardie prophet of ethics, now snootily thinks we voted the wrong way in the referendum and must capitulate to the European empire, ditching the national independence .million voters demanded.Why the hell are these people in politicsthey think so little of the voterswho opted for Leave Theirs is the behaviour of a tyrannous clique whose “delay” to our departure helps only their fellow technocrats in the European Commission.And that’s what it’s all about. They feel a greater kinship with their fellow elitists on the Continent than they do with working-class British voters.The likes of Greg Clark and Amber Rudd and their slippery pal Philip Hammond looked smug yesterday when Mrs May announced the possibility of a delay to Brexit.For them, it’s a game, a ploy, a bid to show that they — and not the unwashed electorate — run the show.Can they not see the dangers  Respect for Westminster, already whacked by the expenses scandal, will take another terrible hit. People will look at the wriggling and the grand- standing and the lies and procrastinating blether of the last day and a half and will conclude that our Parliament is now a place that scorns its electors.Some of you may have greater faith.Some of you may say: “Brexit will prevail in the end”, albeit in diluted form.But eventhat is true, what are we to think in future of the House of Commons Things have reached the stage, I am truly sorry to say, that I now find I hate the very sight of Big Ben and the Palace of Westminster.It is no longer, for me, the proud cockpit of our national le.It has become a nest of aggressive, desperate elitists prepared to do anything to save their greasy grasp on public opinion.They lie. Deceive. Betray. Dissemble. They can delay Brexitthey want but there will be no rebuilding the country’s trust. Not for years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But who really believes that MPs will prevent that too, maybe by backing the second referendum Labour now supports. A delay may well be fatal.We are outraged at the Cabinet Remainers and no-mark ministers who held the PM to ransom to secure a vote over halting No Deal. A clearout of this sorry bunch cannot come too soon.But it is plain that they are calling the shots now, not the ERG’s Brexiteers — despite the  claims of  Anna Soubry.All Tory MPs must remember this: Their party can avoid complete destruction — and indeed can capitalise on  Corbyn’s poll collapse — ONLY by  delivering Brexit. Yes, even Mrs May’s version . . . with an improved backstop.No Brexit leads to No Tories — and the collapse of our political system.IT beggars belief. A Labour Party already engulfed by an anti-Semitism crisis backs a violently anti-Semitic terrorist group.This is our official Opposition,  challenging the Home Secretary for more evidence that Hezbollah’s political wing should be banned from Britain.They’re not convinced by its own  deputy leader admitting there’s no dference between its politicians and its military wing, which is already banned.Nor by the catalogue of atrocities Hezbollah has carried out against  civilians, including children, in Syria.Nor by the fact it is dedicated to driving Jews from their homes.Corbyn and his  aide Seumas Milne won’t bend. They are two upper-class idiots who have spent all their pampered lives romanticising left-wing violence.And yet Labour still wants voters to believe it is not racist — and that our nation’s defence is safe in its hands.What a sick joke.WE commend Facebook, for once, for finally pulling the plug on Tommy Robinson.He may pose as a fearless truth-seeker exercising his right to free speech. In reality he is a criminal thug whose page stirred up violence against Muslims.We’d have more time for Facebook, though,they were equally decisive over removing Islamist extremism.Or self-harm videos.And we ask this of Google’s YouTube, where Robinson still has a presence:What exactly are you waiting for Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That would be a democratic disaster.Yes, this Government has made a catalogue of errors from triggering Article  with no plan, to letting Brussels decide the sequencing of Brexit talks.But at this stage, with the clock ticking towards midnight, there is no time for “coulda woulda shoulda” about what went wrong when.Sun readers knew all along that in a negotiation there’s always give and take.You can’t get everything you want.And although the Prime Minister’s deal has flaws, it’s actually far better than many critics will admit.Those same critics can also be wildly unrealistic about the actual alternatives on offer now.The most likely alternative is in fact a far softer Brexit, which leaves Britain with less not more control.ImagineDavid Cameron had won from Brussels a deal that took back control of immigration, let us set our rules covering the key services sector, and allowed us to scrap the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy.Let’s suppose it gave us control of our fishing waters, let us choose environmental and employment laws as long as we kept to certain general standards, and which got us out of the EU’s political project. He would have been a hero.Yet that is precisely what Theresa May has secured. Even in a worse-case scenario —we end up in the backstop — we will have achieved all those things and will get a veto over new EU directives.We wouldn’t have to pay a single penny of membership costs.I’m not pretending the deal is flawless. We need to improve it to know we can’t be trapped in the backstop forever, and to ensure the EU can’t impose dferent rules in Northern Ireland from the rest of our country.But it sometimes seems that the Prime Minister’s critics cannot see the wood for the trees.Eurosceptics used to say what we wanted was to turn off the tap of endless new European laws, to stop the ratchet where the answer to every question seemed to be “more Brussels”, and to go back to a trading relationship. That’s ­literally what this deal does.So why did her deal suffer such a ­historic defeat last month Some MPs have deeply held concerns, particularly about the backstop, that the Government is rightly trying to address. Some are pursuing perfection. Others — especially in the Labour Party — are just playing politics.But there’s also a group for whom the real issue is personal as well as the policy.They just don’t have faith in the Prime Minister. This is no big secret.More than a third of Tory MPs —  of them — voted against her leadership back in December. To get through that, Theresa May had to promise she wouldn’t lead the party into the next election. But now she may have to go further.I’ve heard senior backbenchers on all sides of the Conservative Party say that their concern about voting for the deal, is that it could mean the Prime Minister stays in place to negotiate our future relationship with the EU.They want someone  to take forward the next phase.If Theresa May manages to agree a deal — and I think she ultimately can — she will have achieved Mission Impossible.But to scrape that deal through the Commons she might, as Sun columnist James Forsyth has suggested, have to throw the kitchen sink at it by agreeing to step aside.Downing Street aides privately acknowledge that she doesn’t want to “go on and on”. They know she faces another inevitable and painful leadership challenge by the end of the year — they want to see her leave with her dignity intact.It’s likely Brussels will eventually give some reassurance on the backstop.This might not quite be the full ­open-heart surgery changes to the deal some want.But the test should be whether the legal position changes. If it does, then the deal deserves to pass.And then, come the end of March, we can stop endlessly re-running referendum arguments about whether we should or shouldn’t leave the EU.We can get on with arguing about what sort of country we want to be after Brexit.We can discuss what we want to do with our newly won ­freedoms.And as a country we can start to move on together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a shareholder in hundreds of ­companies, from Greggs and ­Wetherspoons through to Superdry and Moneysupermarket.The UK is already the third-largest destination for this Norwegian investment, and now they’re putting in more.It seems almost surprising, given the endless choruses of woe about Brexit and the pathetic state of our political class in Westminster. Who would want to bet on a country where the job of economic cheerleader is held by Philip Hammond, and the ­alternative is an out-and-out Marxist like John McDonnell The answer is that the Norwegians can see what we sometimes miss about our own country: The UK is a fantastic place to do business.Our legal system is respected around the world for its fairness and is viewed as a “gold standard” under which to sign contracts and do deals.Our corporate taxes are competitive, and are set to fall further. Our location and time zone help to make us a good bridge into markets around the world.Our language is spoken by billions of people, and is the chosen tongue of global business.Our culture is one that still prizes innovation and hard work, despite the best efforts of some Chancellors over the years.And most of all, our people — our greatest asset — are skilled and creative, as employers, inventors and workers alike.It doesn’t come naturally for us to blow our own trumpets and talk ourselves up, so sometimes it feels a bit awkward to ­consider the many things we have going for us.And we all love a good moan, to the degree that it’s essentially a national sport. But we should be careful that we don’t go too far and start to talk ­ourselves down.There’s a dference between being modest and acting like Eeyore with a hangover. Brexit in particular seems to have driven some people a bit loopy, so that you hear some who were once quite ­sensible now ranting about “destroying the country” or “falling off a clf edge”.To hear them, you would think we are a repellent disaster zone, about to slip beneath the waves never to be seen again, like Atlantis crossed with Towie.This is obviously ridiculous. Of course it’s possible that the process of leaving the EU will be dficult.Thanks to politicians who are still ­incapable of honouring their promises and agreeing a clear way forward, the uncertainty about our future ­relationship with our European neighbours has been allowed to drag on for far too long.But it isn’t Brussels, or even Westminster, that made this country wealthy and successful. It is an enterprising approach to le, combining imagination and hard work, that got us this far.Businesspeople and workers, not ­politicians, created the UK’s success.That won’t go away just because we aren’t paying Jean-Claude Juncker’s lunch expenses any more.And once we escape Brussels’ control, we will be free to be even more ­innovative and nimble in response to all the challenges and opportunities the modern age throws at us.The people entrusted with Norway’s £billion national wealth fund can see that. And they aren’t alone.In the latest available data, the UK was Europe’s top destination for foreign investment.Unlike the blowhards and scaremongers chucking out doom and gloom for ­retweets and laughs, these are serious investors, putting their money where their mouth is and betting that our country has a bright future.I know who I’d believe.Norway fund has holdings in:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will claim their rebellion against Theresa May — a cynical, calculated risk that she is too weak to sack them — was designed to make Brexiteers realise ­voting down her deal could kill Brexit.It may have done that. But it wasn’t lost on Brussels either. And it has severely weakened our hopes of getting the one thing Brexiteers and the DUP need.Cabinet Remainers are guilty both of rank disloyalty and short-sighted stupidity.FOR a shining example of Remoaner madness, witness the negativity to Norway’s huge investment in post-Brexit Britain.Its £billion wealth fund is increasing its UK holdings because, like Qatar, it is sure we will thrive outside the EU.To ex-Labour MP Chris Leslie, though, Norway is just hoovering up our assets on the cheap due to Brexit. Yet he would have been first to blame Brexit had Norway SOLD its UK investments.Some politicians have simply abandoned reason. Their Remainia is religious.THE BBC should be allowed nowhere near its new “BritBox” service.The supposed BBC ITV rival to ­Netflix will require a reported £-a-month subscription. Yet BBC shows are funded by licence-payers. Why should we pay more to see them again ITV’s involvement is fair enough. They’re a private firm. But the BBC loves acting like one, while enjoying a £billion annual bung from TV owners extracted via threat of a criminal record.Why should it be able to deploy that monstrous public subsidy against a brilliant private innovator like Netflix If it wants to compete as a subscription service, fine. But first scrap the licence fee.WE cannot recall a more woeful set of MPs.Yet, without even a vote on it, they will trouser another inflation-beating . per cent pay rise to almost £, a year.That’s  per cent up since .

Police seek to block such attempts.“But women are trying to give birth using someone ’s documents to fool the legal system for adoption.”Police fear that children are also being traded for sex crimes or body parts - although this is not alleged in Volkovas case.She had travelled to St Petersburg , where Anna lives, to give birth to the boy, Mr Tsurkanu said.He said: The pregnant woman tookpassport and was admitted to hospital under the younger woman’s name.“Doctors spotted that the woman and the passport photograph did not match and made a note about it.“Next day after giving birthleft the maternity hospital without the baby.”She handed back the internal passport - used by Russians as an ID document - to Anna who was detained when she went to the hospital to pick up the child.Both women were detained on suspicion of “trading a minor”, said Mr Tsurkanu.He said: “The birth mother was accusedselling her son.

But what will happenit doesn’t pass is truly appalling.If Mrs May’s deal hasn’t won a Commons vote by March , the Commons will vote on whether to proceed with No Deal.The Parliamentary arithmetic is such that No Deal will be defeated.The next day, Parliament will then vote on whether to request an extension from the EU. This vote will almost certainly pass.At this point, the UK would be in the weakest position it has ever been in this negotiation.Whether to grant an extension or not would be up to the EU and would require all  member states to agree.Any extension would almost certainly come with conditions.The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has already said it would have to be “justied by new choices by the British”.It would also be up to the EU to decide how long an extension to offer.If Parliament accepted the terms of the extension, then there would almost certainly be another effort by MPs to take control of the Brexit process.A cross-party group of MPs is already preparing to do this.If they succeed, Brexit would become softer still.Parliament would try to commit the UK to staying in a permanent customs union with the EU.Some MPs would even like to keep the UK in the single market as well, following EU rules on everything from financial services regulation to free movement.Others would use an extension to push for a second referendum.The only way to sidestep this scenario is for Mrs May’s deal to pass by the th.But given that it lost last time round by  votes — a record defeat for a Government bill — this is a hard ask.Mrs May’s plan for getting it through has been to get something on the backstop to reassure MPs that it won’t be permanent.Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, has been tasked with doing this.The key to getting the deal through is persuading the Tories’ confidence and supply partners, the DUP, to accept the deal.If they do, the Tory rebellion will reduce substantially.After all,the DUP are satisfied that the deal won’t end up splitting Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK — the principal criticism of the backstop — then it is hard for any Tory to object to it on these grounds.Along with the Government chief whip, Cox met the DUP on Wednesday night.The verdict of one senior DUP source after that meeting is that the Government is “not there yet” on getting enough for them to come on board.Some leading DUP figures think the move by Cabinet ministers to try to take No Deal off the table has made it less likely that Cox can get enough to satisfy them.“It’s tricky. Barnier isn’t yielding, the Irish aren’t yielding,” complains one Cabinet minister.At the moment there is little optimism in No about being able to hold a meaningful vote next week.That means the Government will have only one chance to turn round a -vote defeat.But Brexiteer MPs should remember that things will only get worseMrs May’s deal hasn’t passed by the evening of March .THE prospects of Mrs May’s deal passing depends on what the DUP and the European Research Group, the main Brexiteer bloc in the Tory Party, make of any changes Geoffrey Cox can secure to the backstop.The ERG has now set up a  of legal eagles to examine what Cox comes back with.The signicance of this group is twofold.First, the DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds – a Cambridge-educated lawyer – is a member of it. This, as one former Cabinet minister tells me, shows “the symbiosis between the DUP and the ERG”.It means the DUP and the ERG are likely to take the same view of whatever Cox delivers. The second is that it provides a structure for examining any changes that Cox secures.Some in the ERG leadership were concerned that the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash – also a lawyer – was determined to rubbish whatever Cox gets.They feared that an instant verdict from him could commit the group to opposing the deal come what may.But no one should think that the other lawyers in the group will be looking to give Cox’s work an easy ride.One leading Tory Brexiteer tells me: “If they unpack the stuffing of Cox’s codpiece and find it is a vainglorious appendage, then they’ll say so.”I understand that Cox is concentrating more on a clearer exit mechanism for the backstop than a time limit.But whether this will be enough to satisfy these lawyers remains to be seen. TOM WATSON’S group of Social Democratic Labour MPs is expected to have its first meeting next week.The question of what Watson, the party’s deputy leader, is up to with this group is preoccupying Labour insiders.One option is that he could use the group to pile pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to adopt positions this group want him to.Labour’s electoral prospects cannot survive many more defections.If Watson regularly made clear thatCorbyn didn’t do X, Y or Z then this group might walk, he could change Labour’s approach in a host of areas.Fear of more defection is what explains why Labour is now moving towards backing a second referendum, and why Corbyn loyalist Chris Williamson has been suspended for saying the party is too apologetic about anti-Semitism.But by setting up this group, Watson also makes it easier for it to one day declare its independence from Corbyn’s leadership and stand on its own two feet as a new political party.The group will, over the coming months, work up the policies that any new party would need.IN private, Tories are eagerly speculating about the leadership contest they expect later this year.Allies of Boris Johnson had been confident that he would, eventually, secure the support of Amber Rudd.They didn’t expect the pair to run on a joint ticket.But they were hopeful that she would back himshe was knocked out in the early rounds of the contest.Securing the support of a Remainer from the One Nation wing of the party would have been a big boost to Boris’s campaign.It would have shown that – contrary to what his critics say – he COULD bring the two wings of the party together.But some of those close to him now fear that the Brexit dferences between them are too big to make such a pact possible.They worry that Rudd might now look for someone  to throw her support behind.One Boris backer tells me: “Amber is playing a very clever game.”If he had done that, Cameron would – probably – have won the referendum and would be coming towards the end of his second term as PM.In both recent negotiations with the EU, the UK has reduced its bargaining power by never properly preparing to walk away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But now the seven-year-old is able to live le to the full after boffins developed a £ plastic limb for her which works just like a normal arm.Phoebe was given a prosthetic at nine months old but it did not move and only served to help with hand and eye coordination.She later used a split hook around the age of five which still didn’tlike a real hand, but her le was changed when she was given the cutting edge new limb.The youngster, who lives with mum Julie, , dad Keith, , and brother Jacob, four, in Hazel Grove, Cheshire, said: “I really like it, all my friends think it’s so cool.“When I first put it on it was a bit weird, because it works just like my right hand, but now I’m used to it. It was really weird because I was able to hold a kne and fork for the first time ever. Now I can brush my hair and play catch with it, I love it so much.”The limb was developed for Phoebe thanks to her aunt Claire Handby, who works for accountancy firm Deloitte.In October  Claire visited a D printing event and saw an adult limb. She contacted the firm’s self-styled chief disruptor Ed Greig and they embarked on a mission to create a limb for Phoebe.Using just three measurements and software created by Charity Team UnLimbited, they were able to create a limb. The device is made with plastic and string and uses the kinetic energy from her elbow movement to make the ligaments close the fingers.Mum Julie is delighted with the limb and now wants the NHS to consider rolling out the technology so that more children can benefit.She said: “It’s just amazing to see how much confidence it has given Phoebe. She used to hide her hand, now she can’t wait to show all her friends. The great thing is D printing makes it so cheap. The NHS can’t afford to spend thousands on bionic hands for children because they are already growing.Phoebe has had nine dferent hands in two years because she is growing - but they only cost £ each because they are printed.”Phoebe has had the hands custom-designed for her and designs have included a troll theme, a Disney Frozen look and a special Man United edition for when she was a mascot at Old Trafford last month.Aunt Claire said: “To see her shake my brother’s hand with her left hand, for the first time in their lives, was priceless. It’s something our family will never forget. Phoebe has gone from being the child that is identied as a victim to the cool kid – her friends say they wish they had a hand like hers.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made dramatic progress with Albi’s help and even started attending school full-time in September. But Mollie has shydeteriorated since he vanished.  Sharon, of Dover, Kent, said: “Once we got Albi we began to notice her little personality coming out for the first time. “She started talking to Albi and shyinteracting with him. “He was her little best friend. Now he’s missing she doesn’t want to go out. “She has tantrums and cries when she sees Albi’s missing posters. She asks, ‘Where is Albi ’ and says, ‘Albi come home’.”  Albi, aged two, was on a walk with Sharon’s husband Carl, , when he was spooked by a German shepherd dog and ran into a housing estate in Whitfield, Kent. Sharon and her family have searched all over the county, even using a snfer dog to track Albi’s scent. Nothing has worked and they are fear he could have been taken anywhere in the UK.  They are now offering a pound, reward for his . Sharon added: “I haven’t slept for worrying about Mollie and where Albi is. It’s heartbreaking to see Mollie lose all the progress she made. “The loss of Albi has affected the whole family, our lives have been turned upside down. “We’ve put off moving and cancelled holidays to find Albi. I would give anything in the world to get him home and back to Mollie.” "},{"url":null,"title":"babysitter shook baby violently left","story":"NewsBabysitter shook baby so violently she was left with bleeding on the brainSyeda Begum was employed by the family of the tot so they could continue to run their small business in AberdeenShareByJamie Beatson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsSyeda Begum is facing a prison sentence after she shook the eight-month-old baby \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA babysitter was found guilty yesterday of shaking an eight-month-old girl so violently that she was left with bleeding on the brain.

On New Year’s Day , the -year-old called the family at about pm to tell them that something was wrong. The baby’s mother told a trial at the High Court in Aberdeen she went to Begum’s flat in the city and found her daughter “floppy and blue”. The girl was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. She suffered seizures in the days afterwards and remained in hospital for two weeks. Medics told the trial the girl, now two, could potentially have problems with learning, memory and concentration in the future. Dr Lynne McDonald, part of the child protection team at Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital, said scans made them suspect “deliberate harm” had come to the child. Begum denied a charge of assault to severe injury and danger of le. She told the court she had been playing with the child and then left her alone for a few minutes.

Appearing at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates Court on Thursday, the defendant pleaded guilty to bigamy and was given a community order. The hearing came just a day after his orce to Mrs Ainscough was finalised in the same court building.

What’s not to love about a couple of free extra days by a hotel pool while the sun is shining  I thought. Until it happened to me and my family this week, after Thomas Cook twice cancelled flights from Cancun while we were at the airport, leaving us delayed for  hours. Because with your head already checked out, your clothes stinking and information blackouts worse than Theresa May’s on Brexit, it was about as much fun as being locked in the gold-plated bathroom of Philip Green’s Med-sailing yacht watching him take a thrice-daily dump. But there was a silver lining. A chance to observe Brits abroad at their most stereotypical and realise that we probably survived the Blitz due to the quality of the comedy that adversity brings out. There’s the Smug Silver Surfers, with no jobs to worry about, who whooped when they heard they were being put up in a five-star hotel, told everyone  to chill as they grabbed another GT and bragged that the compo cheque would pay for another tan-tastic break.

As in “I used to deliver parts to engineering firms and I can tell you for a fact the part this plane’s waiting on won’t get here ’til next week.” The middle-aged man in the replica football shirt accosting random yellow-bibbed airport workers and demanding to know what’s going on, only to be told “Que  I am cleaner”. Who then walks back to his we, shaking his head in disgust and shouting: “Pedro over there hasn’t got a bloody clue. Typical.” There’s the Angry Teacher who thinks he’s in charge of a school trip who shouts down the pilot as he addresses us: “You’re feeding us misinformation. This is just like Kafka.”   Which draws puzzled looks from certain bystanders who think: “Ooh, Kafka sounds worse than Thomas Cook. I won’t be travelling with them.” Your daughter’s on shyFacebook telling schoolmates “THIS IS LIVING HELL”, while your son posts pictures back to shyworkmates of him by a swim-up pool bar with a glass of draft Corona saying: “The sheer agony of a plane delay.” Your partner head-butts her phone as she rows with a Twitter feed ironically called Thomas Cook Cares.

A poll of , festival-goers revealed the tradition of a festival in a field watching band after band is no longer what people want. According to the results, seven in  want activities to get involved with rather than just music to listen to. Popular pastimes Brits want to see on offer at festivals include dining out experiences and local tours, suggesting they’re after more of an overall holiday experience. Cosmin Sarbu, head of Admiral Travel Insurance, whose Ski Festivals Finder tool can help Brits find their perfect festival in the snow, said: “While a lot of people go to a festival to see their favourite bands, many also go for the atmosphere, a new location and other activities to take part in. “It’s important for festival goers – particularly those choosing their first festival – to find the right one for them to fully enjoy the experience.   “For an event which lasts on average a few days, there’s a lot of planning beforehand such as how to get to the festival, what to wear, and how much to budget.” The study also found tying in with the decline in the desire for classic field festivals, one in  are bucking the trend for summer festivals and would prefer a winter event now. It also emerged attendees would like to learn skills when not watching bands, such as playing an instrument, cooking and even skiing. And six in  said the perfect festival includes a mix of activities in the day and parties into the night. The most important factor when choosing from the endless choice of open air music events is the line-up, closely followed by cost and location.   Expectations have changed, as other top factors when deciding on a particular festival were revealed to be the uniqueness of the experience and the key theme. And far from the traditional tent, a hotel was named the ideal place to sleep, closely followed by a log cabin. In fact, three quarters would prefer a festival with a comfortable bed to go back to at night, with the average festival goer considering .am as the perfect time for their head to hit their pillow. But it also emerged rain, litter and insects are among the aspects Brits don’t want to see. Brits polled via OnePoll said the perfect festival will last four days and have no temporary toilets in sight.  While music festivals are clearly the most popular, with three quarters having been to one, other festival favourites include literature, skiing and food. The majority of Brits appear to be home birds, with  per cent choosing the UK for their perfect festival, followed by America and Spain. Cosmin added: “Festivals are no longer just for music – there’s huge ersity in festival types, from skiing and comedy events to food and literature festivals. “All this choice makes it even more important to make sure you’re heading to the right festival for you – location, atmosphere, cost and activities on offer are all part of the experience. “That’s why we’ve created the Ski Festival Finder, to allow people to filter for their preferences and find the best winter festival to suit them.

The professor of anatomy and forensic anthropology is a world expert in idenshyshytying victims of murder and natural disaster. The -year-old mum-of-three from Aberdeenshire led war crimes teams in Kosovo and worked in the aftermath of the  tsunami in Thailand. She even advises crime writers on killers’ techniques. Here, in an extract from her gripping memoir All That Remains, Dame Sue – now Pro Vice Chancellor at Lancaster University – talks about her remarkable le in death....Death is personied as sinister, a dangerous thief in the night. We give her ominous shynicknames – the Grim Reaper, the Great Leveller and portray her as a gaunt skeleton in a dark hooded cloak wielding a deadly scythe, destined to separate our soul from our body with one lethal swipe. We are afraid to attract her attention lest she come for us before we are ready. So we talk about “losing” someone and whisper of their “passing”. But, working every day with death as my companion, I have come to respect her. When she has done her job, I am permitted to do mine. And, thanks to her, I have enjoyed a long, productive and interesting career. Unlike forensic pathology, which seeks a cause and manner of death, forensic anthropology reconstructs the le led. Our job is to reunite the identity constructed during le with what remains of the body. It is hard to imagine the crippling, unresolved grief of the bereaved with no body to mourn. This is why forensic anthropologists will examine every fragment of a body, no matter how small, in an attempt to try to secure an identication. It’s the bodies we cannot name that haunt forensic anthropologists.  In June  I went Kosovo to help identy large numbers of bodies and corroborate witness accounts in support of charges of war crimes against Slobodan Milosevic and his associates. I arrived at the first “indictment site” and put on my usual white crime-scene suit, double latex gloves and heavy-duty black wellington boots – sweltering in C heat. On March  Serbian special police had sacked the village of Velika Krusa. Armed men separated men and boys from their families and herded them into an abandoned outhouse. A gunman stood at the door and sprayed it with Kalashnikov fire. Accomplices then torched the building. Forty men and boys reportedly lost their lives that night. I stood at the door and looked in on a nightmare scene. There were at least  bodies piled in one room and a dozen in the other, all badly burned and decomposed.  They’d been there for three hot months and were boiling with maggots, partly scattered and eaten by animals. There was only one way to clear the space and that was on your hands and knees, working inwards, sting every piece of debris. The aim was to collect body parts and personal effects that might be identiable and also crime evidence including bullets and casings. We cleared both rooms and assigned as much identity to each victim as we could. The oldest was probably in his s and the youngest around . At a separate site, the elderly, women and children had been separated from men in a refugee convoy. The children were taken to one side of a meadow and told to race back to their mothers. With their mothers and grandparents forced to look, the captors shot the children as they ran. Once they were dead, the men turned their guns on the women and elderly. A cold and calculated murder of shyinnocents. As we hiked closer to the grave, our mood grew sombre. This was a despicable place where unspeakable acts had been perpetrated for the sport of barbaric men. The bodies were exhumed one by one from the mass grave. Remains that have been buried are likely to be better preserved – the temperature below ground is cooler, slowing decomposition, and they are protected from predators. But sometimes their good condition makes them harder to deal with.  A two-year-old girl was laid out on the plastic in front of me, still dressed in her sleep suit and red wellingtons. My job was to undress her, to let police take the clothing for evidence and then to begin the anatomical survey, noting the wounds that devastated her tiny form. Suddenly I sensed a blanket of silence had descended. I looked up and saw a line of police blocking me from view. One of our team had made the cardinal error of mentally transposing the face of his own young daughter on to the mutilated body of this little girl and was finding it dficult to cope. So my colleagues were shielding him from the sight of the dead child. Without a word I walked behind the cordon of men and threw my arms around him until he had finished sobbing his heart out. When it comes to the appalling death of an innocent, someone has to shed tears. Having chinks in your armour isn’t always a sign of weakness. It is often a sign of humanity.  One of the questions most frequently asked of forensic anthropologists is how we cope with what we have to see and do. I usually joke “large amounts of alcohol and illegal substances”. Gallows humour often dispels the tension. Do I wake in the night sweating  Do I find it dficult to sleep  The answer is a rather boring and mundane no. I have never been spooked by the dead. It is the living who terry me. The dead are much more predictable and co-operative. So what about my own dying, death and being dead  The death and being dead bits hold no fear. I actually feel a slight frisson of shyexcitement at the possibilities of what isto come. I’m no hero, though, so, like most people, I’d sooner skip through the “dying” part as quickly as possible. I do, however, have some very definite plans for being dead. I want my body put to full use for anatomical education and research and so I will bequeath my remains to a shyScottish anatomy department. My husband Tom is not happy. He doesn’t want me to be dissected. Despite being an anatomist himself, he’s shycharmingly old-fashioned and would like me to have a quiet funeral and be laid to rest in a place where our three girls can visit me.  If I go first, it’s likely he will get his way. However,he goes first, I will scrupulously observe his wishes for his death and then ensure mine are clearly set out. Ideally I would like to be dissected in my own dissecting room but accept it might be unfair on my staff to have to embalm me. Once everything has been dissected, I’d like my skeleton to be maceratedand my bones stored in the skeletal teaching collection at Dundee University or hung up in the dissecting room so I can continue to teach there long after I have stopped ing. Bones have a long shelf le so I could be hanging around for centuries whether my students like it or not. If I achieve my aim, I will never really die, because I will live on in the minds of those who learn anatomy and fall in love with its beauty and logic, just as I did.Extracted by Rachael Bletchly from All That Remains by Prof Sue Black, published by Black Swan, pound., March . The hidden veins that can help to snare a monster Forensic anthropology can now help to identying the living too. In  the politan Police were investigating a father accused by his teenage daughter of coming into her room in the night and touching her as she slept. Her mother did not believe her so this brave young lady set up the camera on her computer to record through the night. At .am it captured infrared images of the right hand and forearm of an man interfering with her as she lay in her bed. The infrared was absorbed by the deoxygenated blood in the intruder’s veins so they were clearly delineated like a map of black tram lines. Our veins are unique to us...but would a court accept an identication based on this evidence  Having compared the veins on the offender’s right hand and forearm with those of the girl’s father, we went to court with our results and opinions. It was the first time such evidence had been heard in a UK trial. When the jury ed a not guilty verdict we were surprised. What were the chances of someone  with a very similar vein pattern being in the teenager’s room at half-past four in the morning  However, the defendant was free to continue living in the very house where his own child had accused him of abuse. What became of the girl I will never know but it worries me to this day that perhaps I could have done more. There is only one way to improve the quality of the evidence we can provide and that is to increase the validity and robustness of the science. We set out to do just that.   By chance, Dundee University was running a course in disshyshyaster victim identication for  police from across the UK. We askedthey would help with a database so we could investigate anatomical iation. Virtually all agreed. We were not looking only at veins: we also started to consider scars and the patterns of moles, freckles and skin creasing at the knuckles. We discovered that, analysed in combination, these were extremely useful in helping distinguish reliably between iniduals. We photographed every officer in infrared and visible light, recording hands, forearms, arms, feet and legs. The database was of great value in validating our research. We got the grants, did the research, wrote the papers and have now helped with over a hundred cases of alleged child sexual abuse. We have been able to help exclude those wrongly accused and to supshyshyply evidence to prosecute the guilty. It is enormously satisfying to have played a part in cases where the courts have handed down sentences for those who commit what I consider to be one of the most heinous of crimes against the most vulnerable in our society. No adult has a right to steal the innocence of childhood.

Mr Tacey said: I walked into the BP garage to get my poorly girlfriend a Smart Water and then put in on the counter and she looked at me asking for my ID. I laughed and woman behind me laughed with confusion.

The motorist, of Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, continued: I just find it ridiculous that you have to show identication for water.

Lincolnshire Live since contacted the petrol station where a member of staff said that it was not common practice to ID people to buy water. He said: We don’t ID for water.

Little Megan Clarkson, aged two, died in January after developing a cough in , which her mum claims doctors said was nothing more than an infection. Her devastated mum Kelly, from Kirkcaldy, Fe, says she took her daughter to see a total of six doctors and five nurses over a period of  months, the Daily Record reports. But she claims she was fobbed off by GPs for two years with no recommendation of an X-ray, despite Megans respiratory rate having increased to double the normal level.   The youngster had begun to lose weight and her chest was indrawing, which is known as subcostal recession - a sign of breathing dficulties. Kelly said Megan had a persistent cough since starting nursery at six months of age, was being sick after eating and was off solids as far back as November . After four months of being constantly told it was nothing more than an upper respiratory tract infection and that some kids cough, Kelly stopped going to her GP. In  her daughter had pain under her arm and bruising that would not go away. She told a nurse practitioner that little Megan had a chesty cough and was choking at night, but was given antibiotics which the youngster could not swallow. Kelly, who has a son Myles, aged five, said: Looking back we feel let down by Megans care when she was around eight to ten months old. Early detection of cancer is your best hope for defeating it and at an earlier stage Megan would have had a  per cent chance of survival and at the end, this had dropped to  per cent. I just think the numbers speak for themselves.   She added: Early detection could have saved her le, but the only way wed have got that isthe doctors had looked passed the viral infections and the come-back--it-gets-worse attitude. When you do come back and it is worse, you feel fobbed off. You feel let down and youre less likely to go back and try to find outtheres anything wrong with your child. Kelly was then given the first of two inhalers to help her daughter breathe and was told the youngster may have asthma, but things took a turn for the worst in December. Megan was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh after Kelly said she had to be nasty in her demands to see a doctor and not a nurse practitioner. By this time the X-ray showed a white out lung, which is often a sign of pneumonia. But Megan was diagnosed with type three Pleuropulmonary Blastoma - a rare and aggressive form of lung cancer found in children. Her windpipe had shted to her left side, which meant her condition could deteriorate quickly. Little Megan was then taken to the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow where an ultrasound of her heart showed the tumour mass had grown. Her best chance of survival being an operation to remove it.  The youngster was operated on and had her whole right lung removed, but suffered a massive bleed and cardiac arrest. She died at nine minutes past midnight on January  - just three weeks after being diagnosed. But despite everything Kelly refuses to point the finger at NHS Fe, believing there has been a systemic failure that has let everyone down. Kelly said: Its not specic to any one person, its letting down the whole system which is letting down the people who work there as well. I believe that nobody is given the chance to do their jobs properly and to help children like Megan. I dont see how thats going to be dferent in the future without a massive change in the system. We need to have an investigation into the practices around how we care for children, particularly young children who cant talk for themselves and improve the level of service that were offered.  NHS Fe medical director Dr Frances Elliot said: The death of any child is a tragedy and our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this very dficult time. NHS Fe has not received any direct communication from the family. However, we would extend an offer to meet with the family to discuss the concerns they have raised.

Its been suggested as many as  per cent of the pupils at Parkfield Community School in Saltley have been taken out by Muslim parents.Alum Rock Community Forum claims the school is undermining of parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality, Birmingham Live reports.Dialogue, petitioning and protests by parents have been repeated and arrogantly ignored, the forum adds. Our children, Our Choice - Work with parents not against them. But the school says the No Outsiders programme, started by the schools assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat MBE, is about making children aware of dferent peoples lestyles.   The programme, run alongside sex and relationship education lessons, promotes LGBT equality and challenges homophobia in primary schools. Books now being read by pupils include Mommy, Mama and Me and King  King - stories about same-sex relationships and marriages. Amanda Spielman, chief inspector of Ofsted, previously explained how it is vital children know about families that have two mummies or two daddies. Mrs Spielman, in light of angry protests against teachings of same-sex couples, told the BBC : Its making sure [children] know just enough to know that some people prefer not to get married to somebody of the opposite sex and that sometimes there are families that have two mummies or two daddies. Its about making sure that children who do happen to realise that they themselves may not fit a conventional pattern know that theyre not bad, theyre not ill. And, at the end of the day, its something that the vast majority of faith schools, even those which clearly teach that homosexuality is not right in their faith, still manage to do in a sensitive and careful way that absolutely does fulfil the law and we report on that very regularly in our inspection reports. This is something where weve got to have sane, rational discussion to say, Are there places where its not working well enough that we can find better ways    But its proper conversation that will change it, not protests, she continued. The essence of democracy is we dont all get our way. The essence of democracy is that we accept majority decision which means there will always be things that some of us dont like. Thatwe were running the country, we wouldnt do. But that is the very essence of it - accepting that we cant have  per cent of what we want.

Shepherd, , had been in hiding in Tblisi, Georgia after being found guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence . He is currently in jail after handing himself into local police on January  - but he has now asked Miss Browns family for a face-to-face meeting so he can tell them he was not responsible, it is believed. He scribbled a note from his cell at a Georgian jail in which he wrote he wanted to look you in the eye and explain everything that happened that tragic evening.But The Sun claims Miss Browns family has snubbed his plea.  A court previously heard Shepherd had met Ms Brown on a dating website and had been trying to impress her at the end of their first date at the Shard. After handing her the controls, the boat hit a submerged log and capsized, sending Ms Brown into the cold water. Shepherd was rescued, having been found clinging to the upturned hull, while his date was recovered unconscious.   Prosecutor Aftab Jafferjee QC told jurors it was sheer madness to take the boat out that night. Jurors heard that le jackets had been tucked away, the kill cord was not connected, and the boat had a number of defects including faulty steering. The defendant, who lived on a houseboat in Hammersmith, west London, and was originally from Exeter, had denied manslaughter.  Earlier this month, a judge ruled Shepherd should stay in jail for three months before another extradition hearing in April. On Tuesday, his legal team provided new evidence that he believes will clear his name. He is said to have been seen by fresh witnesses who say they heard him ask rescuers to help -year-old Charlotte Brown on the river Thames in December . His Georgian lawyers Mariam Kublashvili and Tariel Kakabadze also said thatthe extradition process drags on for nine months - the maximum amount of time he can be held in the Georgian jail - then Shepherd would be a free man under Georgian law. Its possible that he will be free after that time, according to the law in Georgia, said Ms Kublashvili But Jack also doesnt want to lose his chance to put his side across to the Appeal Court, he knows that is important.

Maria Gonzalez Roesch and her newlywed husband were on the Royal Caribbean cruise holiday on February  when they literally missed the boat. The Symphony of the Seas ship was docked at Nassau port, and passengers had been given an all-aboard time of .pm. At .pm, the gangway was removed and doors were closed – the couple arrived five minutes later. Footage of the couple running desperately for the ship was then shared across the world.  The video, taken from the neighbouring Norwegian Bliss cruise liner, shows them arrive, run to the front of the ship and converse with workers onboard, who presumably told them it was too late. The clip shows the pair waving their arms in hopes the ship would stop, and desperate screams of “No!” can be heard from as the vessel moves away. After three minutes, the ship starts blaring its departure horn signalling a final goodbye to the port — and the helpless couple are left behind. Maria, , explained on her Instagram that the cruise on the trip had always left at .pm but that day the ship left earlier.   The honeymooning couple had been given a new itinerary but didnt read it and assumed - wrongly - that the ship would leave on the same schedule as at other ports. Maria also claimed they were not the only passengers stranded at Nassau with six others also making the same mistake.

US authorities concluded one of those slain by the Navy Seals during the firefight in  at the compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan was Bin Laden’s son Hamza, then aged . Paperwork in the bolthole in showed he was being groomed as the heir to the terror boss’s crown. Eight years after the raid, not only is Hamza still alive, he is hellbent on recapturing al-Qaeda’s position as the world’s most dangerous extremists. America is so concerned by his rise to terrorist icon that the nation is now offering a million reward for information leading to his capture. Bruce Riedel, who spent  years in the CIA, said: “Hamza is the most charismatic and potent inidual in the next generation of jihadis, simply because of his lineage and history.”   Mr Riedel, director of the Brookings Institution’s Intelligence Project, added: “At a time when [others] seem to be fading, Hamza is the heir apparent.” The huge reward elevates Hamza into the ranks his father once occupied as one of the world’s most wanted men. Hamza is driven by his desire to avenge the killing of his father, and that of his -year-old son whom he told family died a “martyr”, possibly in an airstrike. While in hiding, Hamza has made public statements urging his followers to wage war on London, Washington, Paris and Tel Aviv. And he has steadily risen in the ranks to become al-Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri’s deputy.   Intelligence experts think it is only a matter time before -year-old Hamza takes full control of the group. He has tapped into the way many jihadis have become disillusioned with al-Qaeda’s uncharismatic leader and who, through frustration, defected to ISIS. Amid the global hunt for Hamza his location has become the subject of much speculation. There are reports of him in Pakistan, Afghanistan and even under house arrest in Iran.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has revoked his citizenship .The US State Department said: “The Justice Program is offering a reward of up to million for information leading to the identication or location in any country of al-Qaeda key leader Hamza bin Laden. “Since at least August , he has released audio and video messages on the internet calling on his followers to launch attacks against the United States and its Western allies, and he has threatened attacks against the United States in revenge for the killing of his father by US service members.” Living underground has not stopped the Crown Prince of Jihad taking some big steps in his le. Last August it was revealed he had married the daughter of Mohammed Atta, the lead hijacker in his father’s   terror attacks that killed , people in the US in . His family confirmed the marriage and that he had taken up a senior position in al-Qaeda to wreak havoc in revenge for the death of his dad. Hamza is the son of one of Bin Laden’s three surviving wives, Khairiah Sabar, who was also living at the home in Abbottabad at the time of the raid.   Strikingly, for a man who strives to be the jihadi superstar, Hamza insists on keeping most of his details hidden from public view. No confirmed photos exist of the terrorist since his childhood, when he was pictured with his father. His opposition to letting his picture be printed is based on his desire not to meet the same fate as his father, but according to experts also hinders his climb to terror icon. Steven Stalinsky, executive director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, said: “People loyal to al-Qaeda and against the Islamic State are looking for inspiration, and they realise he can provide it, But for today’s youth, you need more than audio and an old photograph.” As a young boy in , Hamza was first seen in jihadi propaganda when he appeared in a video uploaded to an al-Qaeda-affiliated website. In the footage, he reads a poem praising one-eyed Afghan mujahideen commander Mullah Omar and explores the wreckage of a plane with Taliban militants and his three older brothers. Four years later he appeared in a video in which he fought against Pakistani soldiers. Then in , Hamza appeared in footage with his father. In it, they called on disaffected teenagers – singling out those from troubled families – to form jihadi cells and “accelerate the destruction” of countries that opposed their views. But his most chilling appearances come from behind the microphone.  None more so than in , two weeks before the Manchester Arena bombing, when he called for attacks on European and North American cities to avenge the deaths of Syrian children killed in airstrikes. Hamza said: “Prepare diligently to inflict crippling losses on those who have disbelieved. “Follow in the footsteps of martyrdom-seekers before you.” The recording is one in a string of his recent statements. Encouraged by the ongoing fall of ISIS, al-Qaeda is swelling in numbers. Hamza has risen to become the jihadists’ greatest recruiting tool, appealing to young Islamist militants who still admire his father but see al-Qaeda as outdated or irrelevant. But Hamza is not advocating his father’s style of jihad. Whereas his dad was famous for his ambitious and meticulously planned terrorist attacks, Hamza urges followers to seize any opportunity to strike at their enemies, using whatever weapon is available.  The extremist says in one recording: “It is not necessary that it should be a military tool. If you are able to pick a firearm, well and goodnot, the options are many.” His views, however, are not shared by all those closest to him. His uncle, Hassan bin Laden, said last year he “thought everyone was over” the death of his brother, Osama. “Then the next thing I knew, Hamza was saying ‘I’m going to avenge my father’,” he added. “If Hamza were in front of me now I would tell him ‘God guide you. Think twice about what you are doing. “‘Don’t retake the steps of your father. You are entering horrible parts of your soul’.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c794433740745.45706646.jpg ","title":"brentford arab to cycle from dundee uniteds tannadice ground to london","story":"A football friendship that kicked off with a chance meeting in a Berlin bar while watching Andy Murray win Wimbledon will see a Brentford fan literally get on his bike at Tannadice on Monday and cycle almost  miles back “home” to the London club’s Grfin Park.In the process, Steve Tidy will take in four games and, most important of all, raise around £, for the Alzheimer’s Trust.The -year-old has travelled north to meet up with good mate Pat McCarron, who’s well-known among Arabs as chairman of the group Fans United, and will take in the Scottish Cup clash with Inverness Caley before setting off the following morning.And his arduous route south is all down to that friendship.“It was back in  and Brentford were in Berlin for pre-season. Myself and a mate were looking for somewhere to watch the tennis and, by chance, we met up with Pat and a few other United fans,” he said. “We had a good bit of banter and we’ve kept in touch since.”The friendship with Pat and other United fans actually led to the formation of a unique supporters’ club, the BeeArabs, so when Steve was planning his latest charity bike ride, this seemed an obvious route to take.“We thought it would be a good idea to start at Tannadice and head for Grfin Park. I had actually planned it as a practice run before I cycle from London to Paris and back via Guernsey in the summer, but this might be an even bigger task.“That said, my biggest challenge could be surviving the weekend with Pat before I set off on the bike!”Once he’s on his way, Steve will complete the journey in stages and take in Brentford games at Middlesbrough and Sheffield United before arriving at Grfin Park just in time for the clash with West Brom later this month.And thanks to the support he’s already receiving, he hopes to pass a personal milestone with his fund- raising efforts.“I got into cycling a few years back and I’ve done a charity ride to Amsterdam to raise money. It’s a great way to stay fit and, by the time I’ve completed this journey, I should have raised around £, in all for a few charities, so that’s not bad.“I am loving the support I am getting from all in Dundee. It’s overwhelming how many nice people there are from Dundee to Durham, Hartlepool to Leeds, Sheffield to London.”"},{"url":null,"title":"charity teams up with car dealer to provide on board learning exhibition","story":"Mentoring charity Breakthrough has celebrated a first in its short history – after convincing car dealer giant Arnold Clark to bring a special van to Dundee designed to expand young minds.The van features an on-board exhibition space packed with interactive exhibits themed around the skills youngsters can acquire through an Arnold Clark apprenticeship.Its debut Dundee appearance was at the city’s Rockwell Learning Centre.Mark Sutherland, head teacher, said: “This was an exciting opportunity for our young people to develop their employability skills and interests in this sector.”Thanking Arnold Clark for its involvement, Breakthrough CEO Jenny Paterson added: “Who knows, some may have been so inspired by the visit that they start the process towards becoming an Arnold Clark apprentice.”Arnold Clark is also getting directly involved in Breakthrough’s mentoring work by encouraging its Dundee staff to sign up to the scheme.n Pictured are Caitlyn Dunn and Steph Jones getting hands-on with one of the interactive exhibits."},{"url":null,"title":"comeback kid paul mcmullan set for new dundee united deal","story":"Paul McMullan’s rebirth as a Dundee United player is set to be confirmed with a new contract for next season.As recently as last August, the former Celtic kid was told he was free to find a new club.At that time Partick Thistle were showing a strong interest but he decided to stay on and fight for his place at Tannadice.And since Robbie Neilson took over as manager in October, the -year-old has made  appearances and is again seen as a part of the squad.McMullan was signed up by Ray McKinnon in the summer of  and was a regular until falling out of favour under Csaba Laszlo early this season.Under the current boss, however, he’s played his part in United hauling themselves back into the Championship promotion race."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee and angus college lecturers prepare for third strike in as many months","story":"College lecturers in Dundee are preparing to strike for the third time in as many months next week in a dispute over pay.All classes at Dundee and Angus College have been cancelled on Wednesday following the announcement of industrial action by the EIS union and Further Education Lecturers’ Association .The action follows strikes on January  and February .EIS-FELA said members were campaigning to “secure a fair cost-of-living pay rise for Scotland’s college lecturers”.EIS-FELA president Pam Currie said: “Despite repeated attempts to engage the management side in meaningful negotiation, talks ended without progress being made.“In the absence of an improved offer, EIS-FELA will open a statutory ballot next week for action short of a strikein the form of a resulting boycott in addition to further strike days.” John Gribben, director of employment services at Colleges Scotland Employers’ Association, said: “Colleges have now made six offers to the EIS-FELA but, once again, they have decided not to accept a great deal.“The overall pay rise from harmonisation and the additional pay offer on the table represents a national average increase of £, – or more than % for college lecturers.“All of the money being offered for the additional pay offer has to come from colleges making cuts.“The colleges’ previous offer cost £. million, while the pay demand from the EIS-FELA would cost £m.”DA College confirmed all classes on Wednesday would be cancelled, but buildings would still be open to students to allow for study and other arrangements made by staff.

It was really interesting to seeI’ve still got it but it was the last time I will compete.“It was nice because I was coming off a good couple of wins and feeling brilliant.“Age is just a number and I

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency glasgow prestwick airport cessna","story":"NewsEmergency at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as Cessna plane overshoots runway after engine failureThe incident saw a Cessna  overshoot the runway following the loss of engine power.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn emergency was declared at Prestwick Airport this afternoon after a light aircraft overshot the runway.

Little Saul Wylie will travel to America for le-changing treatment on his severe form of cerebral palsy. The six-year-old, who weighed just lb at birth, has made the waiting list for pioneering surgery. There has been a massive charity effort across Ayrshire to fund the trip, with pound, raised in little over six months.Mum Karen, , told the Ayrshire Post : “To achieve this so quickly is beyond our wildest dreams.“We set a target of two years to get the money but the community reaction has been incredible.” Saul, of Tarbolton, has to go to the States because his aggressive condition is not treated on the NHS. The brave kid lives with spastic diplegia cerebral palsy, which affects his muscle tone and leaves him unable to walk unaided. Karen said: “Saul’s dream is to be able to stand by himself and take independent steps and maybe even one day walk around school with his friends. “Like every parent, we long for endless opportunities for our boy. “Saul is very happy and determined but we just want him to have the best opportunity at a better quality of le and to become as independent as possible.”  Medication, Botox, and even trampoline therapy have all been used to try and limit Saul’s pain. But his spot at St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri could be the ultimate answer. Karen said: “The operation is called selective dorsal rhizotomy, which will reduce Saul’s muscle stfness. “Added to intensive rehab, it will allow Saul to stand independently and potentially walk again. Unfortunately there is a waiting list for international patients so Saul’s surgery is not scheduled until . “But because we are in a position to go we have been put on their cancellation list and are keeping our fingers crossed.” Karen and husband Stuart have thrown themselves into a string of fundraising events with the ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign gathering momentum. Karen said: “We’ve done everything from coffee mornings to quiz nights and we can’t thank people enough for their response. “There have been skyes, race nights, sponsored cycles and I also did the Great Scottish Run. “People have taken Saul to their hearts and we’ve even had donations from as far afield as America, New Zealand, Canada and Ireland. “Hopefully he now has the chance he deserves.” • An open ice skate for Saul will take place at Ayr Ice Rink on Sunday, April , from -pm.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnDrugsCerebral palsyCharityAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14070383.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/0_wrtwrt.jpg","title":"hmv re opens three scottish","story":"NewsHMV re-opens three Scottish stores after successful negotiations with landlordsThe companys managing director confirmed the move was \"the best outcome for our staff and customers\".ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsGeneral view of HMV at Ayr Central\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMusic giant HMV has re-opened its shop in Ayr Central shopping centre.

Sleazy retired architect Ross McKay will also be kept under court supervision for the same period. McKay, , insisted he was innocent of the sordid behaviour but he was found guilty after a trial last month. Sherf John Montgomery told McKay: “You have been convicted of conduct which, in my estimation, contains a substantial sexual element and a signicant sexual aspect by clandestinely taking photos of female schoolgirls wearing short skirts. “At  years of age you really should be able to control yourself more appropriately than you have done by indulging in this sort of behaviour.” Sherf Montgomery warned McKay: “I detect an air of defiance from you, both at your trial and in what you have told the author of your criminal justice social work report. “My advice to you is keep a low profile. Do not put yourself in a position where it can be construed you have the aim of self-gratication.” Defence lawyer Gillian McBlane successfully argued against the imposition of a stringent sex offender prevention order against her client. This was requested by depute fiscal Vicky McMillan, and would have kept McKay out of public parks and well away from schools.   Ms McBlane said: “He is first offender and there is little to suggest he presents a signicant risk to the public.” Sherf Montgomery reminded her: “He continues to deny responsiblility.” But Ms McBlane maintained: “He very much recognises the authority of the court and he has assured me of his commitment to any order you might impose.” McKay, of Ardlochan Terrace in Maidens, insisted at his trial that he had not taken the photos of Belmont Academy schoolgirls in mini skirts that were found on his phone. He also denied stopping his car in Peggieshill Road to take the images, although the court heard evidence of a vehicle with the same registration as McKay’s parked there. The offences took place in mid- and again in March . Sherf Montgomery told McKay at the trial: “There is overwhelming evidence it was you in your car. “You’re guilty all day long.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSex crimeAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14066677.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elr_ayp_260613babs.jpg","title":"tributes paid mr gaiety ayr","story":"NewsTributes paid to Mr Gaiety as Ayr theatre legend Bernard Cotton diesBernard Cotton was a do-it-all theatre manager in the Gaietys pomp and booked acts like Billy Connolly, Ken Dodd and Barbara Windsor.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsBernard outside his beloved Gaiety \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man who was ‘Mr Gaiety’ in Ayr for nearly two decades has died suddenly, aged , writes Edwin Lawrence. Bernard Cotton was at Alloway Bowling Club when he collapsed and died on Thursday last week. He had been club champion on ious occasions, the last time in . But it was as manager of the Gaiety from  to  that Bernard made his biggest impact. He took over at a critical time when the theatre’s ownership passed from the Popplewell family to the Royal Burgh of Ayr. But Bernard was the perfect man for the job, having managed the Empire Theatre in his home town of Sunderland. There he had hosted shows featuring The Beatles and Hollywood legend Marlene Dietrich. “He even shared a McEwan’s Export with Marlene,” said son Sam, . “They didn’t have any champagne to give Marlene so she had what dad was drinking - only with ice.”. Bernard was no ordinary theatre manager and often directed big showpiece events like pantos and summer season shows. He quickly became respected by some of the biggest names on the Scottish scene. He booked acts like Jimmy Logan, Billy Connolly, Rikki Fulton, Jack Milroy and perennial Gaiety favourite Johnnie Beattie. Bernard also knew some of the biggest UK stars, bringing Ken Dodd, Barbara Windsor, Pat Phoenix and Lionel Blair to the Gaiety.  He did not shy away from tough decisions, booking the controversial erotic revue ‘Oh! Calcutta!’ in . He later recalled: “It brought much adverse publicity and even the poster was frowned upon - to such an extent that the management agreed to cover over the female posterior that was displayed upon it.” However, the show was a massive financial success with only two unsold seats in a week-long run. Sam remembers his dad sharing a story of a couple walking out of the show in high dudgeon. Bernard asked them why, as it had been advertised as an X-rated show. The shocked couple told him they thought they had booked to see ‘Oklahoma!’. Another of Bernard’s controversial - but highly successful - bookings was ‘The Rocky Horror Show’, which attracts enthusiastic fans who often dress in stockings, corsets and suspenders. For although Bernard principally ran a family theatre, he believed it should cater for all tastes. A post on the Gaiety Facebook page says: “We are deeply saddened to hear about the loss of Bernard Cotton, a much loved colleague, dedicated family man and friend to all. “Bernard was and is a Gaiety institution, from his own time managing our Old Lady to helping us shape her future. We simply couldn’t have done it without his support. “His guidance, golden nuggets from years gone by, witty humour and love for delivering high-quality theatre for all were second to none. He will be sorely missed by us all. “At this sad time we are thinking of his beloved we Vida and children Julia and Sam. “We wish them moments of peace and comfort as they remember a husband, father and friend who was so cherished. “He will forever be in our hearts and minds and will always have a place in his beloved theatre.”  Musician Martin Henderson commented: “Bernard was witty, professional and a family man, a privilege to have worked for many years in the Gaiety while Bernard and Vida were at the helm. “He ran a tight ship but embraced risky ventures like our annual mock panto, which needs no explanation to Gaiety staff. A sad loss to Scottish theatre and his family.” Journalist Alistair Nicol said: “I met Bernard when I was deputy editor of the Ayrshire Post in  and he was always helpful and a great inspiration to all around him in the entertainment world.” Bernard Cotton was a former president of the Rotary Club of Ayr He is survived by we Vida, a stalwart Gaiety volunteer who formerly ran the theatre’s costume department London-based daughter Julia, , a former dancer and Brighton-based son Sam.

and a foot-tapping reminder of the swinging sexism of the late s.For anyone who enjoys those wonderful kitchen-sink dramas of the decade - A Taste of Honey, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, or Poor Cow - this is for you.Although, in fairness, at times it feels more Sid James than Shelagh Delaney as the humour and slapstick of Carry On provide plenty of laughs.And for anyone, like myself, who doesnt already know Made in Dagenham the Musical, dont despair... the songs, like the early Ford Cortinas, are instantly adorable.Kirsty Cleland has all the allure of a young Rita Tushingham as she enchants, enthrals and entertains in the lead role.As a strike-leader and long-suffering we, the Galashiels actress is both convincing and commanding.And the ever-reliable Stuart Mitchell, who plays hard-done-by husband Eddie, has to be at the top of his game not to be outshone.But, in true socialist fashion, Made in Dagenham the Musical isnt just about the leads... everyone has their part to play - and how well they play it.Tracy Borthwick is having a blast as the potty-mouthed Beryl.And Amanda Blacklock is pitch perfect as the hapless Clare who attempts to keep up with the flow of double-entendres.Ellen McFadzen, with her Viv Nicholson hair-style and shortening mini-skirts, is a delight as sassy Sandra.And the shopfloor resolve is perfectly pitched by Ellen Halliday, as Cassie, and Julie Craig, as Connie.Relationships, friendships and even governments are tested in this factual story which, historically, helped females eventually earn an equal footing when it came to filling up pay packets.Robin Murray could challenge Mike Yarwood with his hilarious performance as Harold Wilson.And hes regularly brought down a peg or two by the feisty Rachel Inglis as Barbara Castle.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a battle of the classes as much as the sexes, with Jodie Millar and Yvonne Mitchell providing some gentried grace.The dialogue is a delight, the foot-to-the-floor pace is perfect, and the choreography, costumes, straight from Carnaby Street, and score makes sure this is a production that will strike a chord for decades to come.But for any musical production to be a success, it needs songs.From the brilliant opening scene, this show doesnt disappoint.Busy Women, Everybody Out and Viva Eastbourne are nothing other than tremendous encore numbers that bring out the very best of this talented cast.But perhaps the highlights are Julie Craigs sensational take on the riveting Same Old Story, Rachel Inglis reaching the high notes in the incredible Ideal World, and the delightful duet of Stuart Mitchell and Kirsty Cleland with the making-up masterpiece Im Sorry, I Love You.Made in Dagenham the Musical is a celebration of women fighting for their rights.While it succeeds, this move away from the comfort zone is more of a testament to just how good Selkirk Musical Theatre Company has become.If you havent yet got your tickets... join the picket line quickly and dont be disappointed.Made in Dagenham the Musical runs every night this week at .pm with an additional matinee performed on Saturday at pm.CASTRita OGrady -

No concrete dates have been set as the event is still being finalised. However, local people and businesses are encouraged to get involved to help promote Hoggrsquos Borders legacy.Internationally, the anniversary will be celebrated in Washington DC.Enthusiasts can attend an event held in the Library of Congress where they will be talking about Hoggrsquos le and Borderrsquos traditions.Stirling University is known as the world centre of Hoggs work.And they are currently doing a project to collect all the poets work and republish it. So far,  volumes of Hoggrsquos work have been collected, and  have been published.The project started in the mid s and the estimated finishing date wonrsquot be till .The programme of events is still in the planning stage and the organisers are currently raising money to hold the celebrations around the Borders and in Stirling.They are currently applying to ious sources for a six-figure sum to

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"carradales organic hairds salon leads the o way","story":"A hair stylist and barber have left the west of England#s city streets for Kintyre#s quality of le.Vegetarian husband and we team Annik and Michael Wintle-Brown have opened Kintyre#s first salon # one of only  in Scotland # using Italian O-Way organic products.These are plastic free and #cruelty free# as they are not tested on animals.As well as being made with organic chemistry, they are packed in amber glass bottles which keep the product fresh and are more easily recyclable.Annik and Michael, who recently opened Carradale#s h#Airds salon in a former holiday chalet, fell in love with the area after a stylist, Lucy Freeman, also from Gloucester, shared photos online.Last Thursday client Lesley Freeman, explained, as Annik styled her hair in Carradale: #We moved here more than three years ago when my husband Darren took a job with CS Wind.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Irsquom not sure who exactly has been preventing transgender women using public conveniences. So far as I know, you donrsquot have to show a birth certicate, or undergo a medical exam to have a pee. But what do I know as a pale, stale male.What I do know is that ldquocis-gender is an ugly neologism which many women find offensive. They are content with their present sexual terminology. ldquoCis is in the same linguistic ballpark as ldquoTERF ndash trans exclusionary radical feminist, which is a term of abuse used against women who believe persons with penises are, er, male. I should be careful here because a number of TERFS have been banned from social media for saying that a person with a penis is a man. So I wonrsquot say that.Instead, letrsquos just take it as read that in future we are going to have to accept that the concept of sexual dferentiation with which we have been living for thousands of years is finally being exposed as a malign transphobic hood. At any rate, the Scottish Government appears determined to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act, which will allow trans people to assign themselves legally and biologically female. Hitherto, trans people have had to undergo medical examination and get a diagnosis of ldquogender dysphoria. No more. From now on, anyone can change their birth certicate to whatever they wish.Earlier this month, Holyroodrsquos culture committee warned that ending binary ldquoMale or Female questions in the Scottish census will render much of the results meaningless and, willy nilly, import an unscientic definition of sex into the law. But the Scottish Government is not listening. Nicola Sturgeon told a UN equalities conference last week that the concerns of feminists about the GRA are ldquomisplaced.Women ndash sorry, ldquomenstruators ndash who say that self-ID erases their sexual identity will be told: just get over it. They can complain that ldquosex is a protected characteristic under the  Equalities Act, and that women therefore have a right to their own unique spaces. But now that men can actually become women under the law, this right will be impossible to articulate. Trans women with male anatomy will be entitled to enter womenrsquos changing rooms, girl guide troops or womenrsquos prisons. Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Last chance for Mundell to put country before party","story":"The majority of these demands are perfunctory, of course, made in the knowledge and expectation that they will be ignored by the target, while playing well with the initiatorrsquos supporters.The craziness of the last few months has precipitated a flurry of genuine and warranted resignation demands, however, which under normal political circumstances would have resulted in multiple ministerial heads rolling in any other era the Prime Minister would have been forced out long ago.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysAnother case in point is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, whose stubborn insistence on being ineffectual in the face of the biggest crisis this country has faced in generations is matched only by that of Jeremy Corbyn.

The SNP is right to call for Mr Mundell to show some mettle and make clear that he will not serve in a Government that is willing to take us out of the European Union without a deal, a situation that would put the already fragile Scottish economy on the road to ruin. As the Scottish Secretary is well aware, businesses will fail, jobs will be lost and real people will suffer the sort of real hardships that will be dficult to recover from.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has written to Mr Mundell, laying out the gravity of the situation and calling on him to back growing cross-party demands to halt the Brexit process by extending Article  and making clear to his boss, Theresa May, that he will resign unless she faces up the extremists in her party and takes no-deal off the table.At this critical juncture, the least that the people of Scotland deserve from the man who represents them at Cabinet level is honesty about where his loyalties lie: will he put country or party first  Mr Mundell, it really is that simple.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitOf course, Mr Blackfordrsquos letter also highlights the bleakness of the dilemma facing the SNP. If Mrs May gets her way and Parliament is faced with a last-minute binary choice between her terrible deal - which deprives us of the key benefits being in the EU - and an even more catastrophic no-deal, it leaves the party in a dficult position. How should Nicola Sturgeon instruct her MPs to vote in this scenario  Backing Mrs Mayrsquos ldquomy way or the highway deal would be criticised by many as a U-turn of epic proportions and a sign of weakness. Not voting for it, and thus facilitating a no-deal Brexit, would likely be viewed by many voters as unforgivable, leaving the party open to allegations that this is the outcome it has been secretly hoping for all along, in order to boost support for independence.Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues will be hoping the growing number of Tory ministers and backbench MPs ndash including Cabinet secretaries Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke - poised to revolt against their leader should she refuse to rule out a no-deal Brexit, will come to their rescue in the frantic days and weeks to come.Marianne Taylor: BBC is better off without Neil and HumphrysThe emergence of the The Independent Groupmay also end up helping the SNPrsquos predicament, at least in the short term. Formed last week when eight MPs resigned from Labour unhappy at Mr Corbynrsquos disastrous leadership, it did not initially appear to be an important development. But when three Tory MPs also resigned and joined up, using the moment to launch a blistering attack on Mrs Mayrsquos disastrous Brexit strategy and their partyrsquos lurch to the right, it started to feel more signicant.What binds these MPs from dferent sides of the House of Commons is dismay at the drt of both parties to the extremities. And despite not being a proper party - yet - or having any actual policiesit seems many voters quite like what they see.Read more: Mundell should resign there is no-deal BrexitMomentum has grown over the weekend, with polls already putting the group on  per cent, just one behind the increasingly irrelevant Lib Dems.Many are asking whether TIG has a future.

Irsquove watched their jaws drop as they walk in.Born out of a joint Anglo-French project, Concordersquos maiden flight success was savoured as a moment of intense national pride.Most impressive of all was its speed. A cruising velocity of twice the speed of sound, or mph, allowed it to cover a mile in just . seconds.The epitome of cutting-edge technology of its time, Scots aviation fans can at least claim Concordersquos distinctive swept-back super-slim delta wings as their own.Designed under the leadership of Penicuik-born Sir James Hamilton, they were highly complex with a twist and drop design designed to cope with extreme speed.Hamilton left the Concorde project in , by which time the brave test pilots like fellow Scot, Ayr-born John Cochrane had pushed the craft to her limits.He was at the controls when Concorde blasted through the sound barrier for the first time in , and was on the operational flight when the it reached its highest speed of Mach . and an altitude of ,ft, and achieved the Atlantic speed record from take-off to touchdown in .Cochrane was handed overall responsibility for the engine intake systems ndash a task that involved highpressure flying in which he pushed the aircraft to its technical extremes.Many of what must have been adrenalin-fuelled, near deathdefying test flights took place over the west coast of Scotland.ldquoA lot of these flights were out of Prestwick, which was used as a training base and where pilots would take off and fly for a bit before landing, explains Brown.ldquoBecause of the sonic boom, there were lots of trials and flights, many up and down the west coast of the UK, before she received her certicates.Fty sonic boom test flights took place over three years from .People living along the coast and even in Dublin and Glasgow, were warned to be prepared for the sudden lsquobangrsquo as the aircraft sped by.Incredible as it may seem today, Concordersquos development began just  years after the Second World War had ended, and when Glasgow Corporation trams still rattled through the cityrsquos streets.Throughout her letime, British Airways Concorde fleet would go on to make just under , flights and carry more than .m passengers on the supersonic flight of their lives.Exclusive, fast and unique, it attracted a well-heeled fan base, with regular passengers including Joan Collins, Sir Paul McCartney and Diana, Princess of Wales.Travelling on Concorde became an experience in itself, with its up to  passengers speaking of the ldquokick in the back as the aircraft took off and the rising heat as it powered across the Atlantic.Jock Lowe, the longest serving Concorde pilot, said flying the aircraft was ldquolike driving a sports car compared with a normal car.While BArsquos Concorde fleet regularly ploughed a route ,ft above the ground between London and New York, short day trips from Edinburgh around the Bay of Biscay and back gave lsquoordinaryrsquo passengers the supersonic experience without the eye-watering pound, cost of a transatlantic ticket.ldquoTravel agents like Bennettrsquos in Musselburgh sold tickets, and included with the flight details was a car sticker to put in the window because there would be so many people at the airport just to see Concorde that passengers would be at risk of missing the flight.Concorde was retired from service in October , with British Airways and Air France blaming a downturn in passenger numbers and rising maintenance costs.It also came after an Air France Concorde crashed minutes following take-off from Paris in July , killing all  people on board and four on the ground.Aviation analyst John Strickland does not believe another large-scale version will be developed while passengers prioritise low fares above speed.ldquoIf you cut the time it takes to fly to Australia in half, there would be a level of interest, he said.ldquoBut what would people be willing to pay, relative to the price of such an aircraft and the investment required to make it Meanwhile, for museum visitors there is likely to be a touch of sadness at her early demise.ldquo  was a big issue: no-one wanted to fly to America, and Air

It isnrsquot. Itrsquos pitched at an internal audience.In particular, itrsquos pitched at those many SNP members who are suspicious of the leadershiprsquos Growth Commission, the hair-shirt economic blueprint for an independent Scotland written by former MSP turned corporate lobbyist Andrew Wilson.A heresy against the  White Paper, the Commissionrsquos report recommended spending Decade One after a Yes vote driving down debt and keeping a tight grip on public spending. It also backed keeping the pound ndash at least for now.Ms Sturgeon declared herself delighted, the membership less so. Besides the whf of austerity, there was that plan to keep sterling and UK monetary policies. Former SNP MPs such as George Kerevan politely but firmly laid into it.After hosting a series of National Assemblies to hear the views of SNP members, Mr Brown will put a motion to Aprilrsquos conference backing most of the Commissionrsquos  recommendations, but with a more gung-ho line on currency.Writing for the home crowd in The National yesterday, Mr Brown said: ldquoWe will propose that it should now be party policy that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would establish an independent currency. So far, so clear. But then the fog descends.ldquoOf course, until that can be done safely and securely, our currency would continue to be the pound sterling. It must be done at the right time, in a way that affords necessary protection for our nationrsquos economy and for peoplersquos personal finances.ldquoThe aim of an SNP government would be to complete preparations in time for the newly independent Scottish Parliament, informed by assessments and information from the Central Bank, to take a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of its first term.ldquoThis will ensure that the use of sterling is not an open-ended commitment ndash an issue raised at the National Assemblies.The language is new. But at best, the leadership has moved from agnosticism on a new currency to a highly caveated inclination. Yet something that heavily caveated isnrsquot really a belief in anything. Itrsquos a fudge. Itrsquos also a muddle.For example, Mr Brown seems to suggest evidence and economics would count, but also that Holyrood would decide to back a currency on a set timetable regardless.A politically brave idea, as it would make the following election a referendum on whether to follow through with that decision.Mr Brown also reminds me of someone daydreaming about how theyrsquoll spend their lottery millions before theyrsquove even bought a ticket. It may be enjoyable, but therersquos the small matter of winning first. It was noticeable he didnrsquot offer a timetable on actually securing independence.The audience for this mush is clear from the last line, where he says activists at the partyrsquos National Assemblies didnrsquot like the idea of an open-ended commitment to sterling.They must be a conspiratorial lot. The Growth Commission never made an open-ended commitment to sterling. It said it should be used until something  made more sense, as did the SNP Governmentrsquos Fiscal Commission before the  referendum. Both said sterling was best initially because the UK and Scottish economies were so aligned.But both were open to a new currencythe economies erged. The Commission proposed six tests on credibility, markets, debt, trade, reserves , and public appetite. Explaining the process to voters before a referendum was an ldquoabsolutely necessity, it said. Both were also clear context was all. There was no dogmatism about having or not having a new Scottish currency. It all came down to the circumstances. They definitely did not say, lsquoLetrsquos do this in the first term of an independent parliament to keep the troops happy.rsquoBut it seems National Assembly-goers live in dread of an indefinite backstop on the currency, and want to put a time limit on it, whether itrsquos rational or not. How very ERG-like.I suspect that, behind the fudge, the SNP hierarchy is keeping faith with the Growth Commission, because it sees sense in it, while talking more warmly about a new currency to molly the members.This could backfire on several fronts. The members could see straight through it and get more disgruntled. It was interesting how much scepticism there was from senior SNP figures who want a new currency yesterday. The leadership is not trusted on this. Even vague talk of a new currency could become a giant bullseye for Unionists, who would use to it attack the SNP as reckless and flaky. The party has, after all, backed the euro, the pound, and now, sort of, a third currency.It does not seem driven by long-term national interest, but by short-term party management. The Tories have their Eurosceptics to placate, the SNP their sterling-sceptics.The key thing is whether it helps the cause. But who does this idea appeal to outside the  per cent Will a mystery currency move a single No voter to Yes  Did people reject independence because the last currency offer wasnrsquot radical enough  Did they object to their wages and pensions staying in sterling  Were they crying out to take a punt on a Scottish pound Mr Brown seems to think so. ldquoI believe this approach will maximize support for an independent Scotland, he wrote yesterday. I believe he may be disappointed."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-first-time-buyer-numbers-more-than-double-in-a-decade","story":"Figures from the Bank of Scotland show there were, in , compared with

stakeholders to tackle this issue.Airport and airline representative bodies are opposed to the fine proposals.Airlines UK said: ldquoWhilst any occurrence of a misdirected passenger is unacceptable and must be fully investigated, the total number of incidents remains extremely low in proportion to the growing number of passengers using UK airports.ldquoRather than a new civil penalty for airlines ndash which we do not believe would be proportionate, effective or fair ndash the focus must instead be on ensuring effective collaboration between the Home Office and the entire industry

rare misdirection does occur, such as when airline crew or staff from a ground-handling company accidentally direct passengers down the wrong corridor, airports use their full resources to recover this incident as quickly as possible.ldquoAs a result of this work, the vast majority of passengers who are initially directed to the wrong part of arrivals are fully recovered and redirected to

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Saturday  Mar  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Delay to Wick 20 mph speed limit plans","story":"THE brakes have been put on plans to introduce a  mph speed limit on the majority of roads in Wick.The proposal was mooted by Highland Council as a way to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling.However, Wick members of the Caithness committee this week described the scheme as \"a blunt instrument\" and said other measures to reduce speed would be more effective.

Caithness Horizons has been a great success in interpreting the geology, wildle and history of the far north for local people and visitors alike. It is up to date, visually striking, full of information and everyone who has been has come away much enthused.\"The closure of Caithness Horizons is precisely what we cannot allow to happen and it is for this reason that the Scottish Government should play its part in securing a future for the facility.\"Councillor Struan Mackie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, is concerned about public statements on dispersing the collection and says that is \"contrary to the founding principles of Horizons\".He said any part of the permanent collection not on loan \"must remain in Caithness, regardless of the future of the Horizons facility. And in the event of closure the permanent collection would revert to the Highland Council.\"Councillor Mackie says the local authority should explore alternative operating models and wants \"a cast iron commitment to ensure our countys heritage stays in Caithness for future generations.\"Ian Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, which runs Wick Heritage Museum in the townrsquos Bank Row, described the closure of Caithness Horizons as \"a great loss\".\"From a heritage point of view it is certainly important, particularly its collection which should not be broken up and dispersed,\" he said.Mr Leith emphasised that the heritage groups in Caithness are not in competition \"but telling parts of the same story\". He said: Caithness Horizons had its part to play. Now its gone it is a great loss, but hopefully it can be retrieved.\"He said the Thurso museum and gallery had \"very dedicated and very experienced staff\".Mr Leith added: \"It is too important to lose, particularly its heritage collection which has a national signicance.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web-subs-3.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland olympic hero dame mary peters further honoured by the queen","story":"Dame Mary, from Northern

Braid Valley Vintage Enthusiasts presented the Scheme with a cheque for pound, for the purchase of two defibrillators and response packs.John Crothers presented the cheque to Stephen Lamont and Alan Murray, two of the team working to get the scheme operational by early summer. Alan Murray thanked them for their generosity and emphasised the importance of the new venture.“Last year in Northern Ireland there were almost  out of hospital cardiac arrests: an average of four a day. Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillation within  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Braid Valley Community First Responders aims to train and organise local people to respond to cardiac arrests in their own community while the ambulance is on its way and improve survival rates in Broughshane and Ballymena and the surrounding rural areas.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles. A similar structure linking Denmark and Sweden will be used as a guide when investigating the logistics of the bridge.Ian Paisley welcomed the positive discussions.He said: “This move from a Red Light to an Amber Light shows progress and is encouraging for a future Green Light on the bridge project.”Speaking to the , Mr Paisley added: “This is a matter I have raised at our select committee and now the transport secretary is taking this forward to find a way of supporting a feasibility study. “That would be a signicant move and would be most welcome.“Obviously this is at an early stage but it wouldn’t take a blind man on a galloping horse to miss the opportunities for employment commerce and tourism!“Any feasibility study would have to look at where the bridge would leave NI and enter the mainland all of that will now need to be considered.“As a unionist it’s very obvious to see the added attraction of linking our kingdom in this physical way.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

They visited a mix of work-based credit unions and community credit unions to provide much-needed technical assistance, especially in rural districts of the Bwiam region.The technical assistance provided by Rosaleen and the coaches included providing support to Gambian credit union staff on day-to-day operations, loan management and credit control.Following each credit union visit Rosaleen and Michael had the opportunity to meet with their Boards and put forward recommendations on how to further develop their credit union .Rosaleen and the coaches also organised for a meeting with local taxi drivers to discuss the potential of them setting up their own credit union.At the end of the visits the coaches hosted a two-day workshop for credit union personnel in Banjul. This allowed for the coaches to discuss credit union issues and share their knowledge with the participants.Rosaleen presented on the topic of governance to the participants.Throughout the two weeks Rosaleen and her fellow volunteers were able to share their skills and knowledge to build the capacity of the credit union personnel in The Gambia and empower them to further strengthen their movement.Rosaleen also had the opportunity to meet credit union members and hear about how the credit union is making a real dference in their lives.The Irish credit union movement is highly regarded across the world and the visit by the Irish coaches was hugely appreciated by the credit union movement in The Gambia.Speaking about her visit, Rosaleen said: “I would like to take the opportunity to thank the members of Newington Credit Union who have supported the ILCU Foundation for many years.“To be able to visit one of the countries which benefit from our support and come back and share my experience enables me to highlight the needs of small rural communities who live in abject poverty.“In facing such conditions the people remain cheerful and are always smiling – hence the name given to The Gambia: the Smiling Coast of Africa. The Gambian credit union volunteers and staff are so keen to enhance their knowledge and skills to develop their credit unions and I hope in the coming years they go from strength to strength.“I would like to thank my fellow coaches, the ILCU Foundation and NACCUG who helped make the trip so successful. ”Baboucarr Jeng, General Manager NACCUG, expressed his thanks to Rosaleen and the coaches for giving their time to help the credit unions in The Gambia and he emphasised the need for the participants “to use the education from the training to develop their skills and the credit unions they represent”.Alan Moore, CEO ILCU Foundation, added: “It has been great to have Rosaleen on board for our coaching programme for the past two years, she has been a fantastic ambassador for the ILCU Foundation and indeed the wider Irish credit union movement.“Throughout the course of her time in The Gambia, our partner credit unions have learnt a great deal from Rosaleen and her fellow coaches.“We are very grateful to Rosaleen for giving up her time to volunteer to help our partners, who, like Rosaleen, know the value of having a credit union and what it means for the members.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank Newington Credit Union who supported Rosaleen to participate in the Coaching Programme and for their continued support to the ILCU Foundation’s work.”Newington Credit Union.- Duncairn Gardens,Belfast,BT GF.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"full steam ahead for carryduff gaelscoil","story":"THE committee of a new Irish-medium nursery school in Carryduff has said it is confident it will open its doors as planned despite losing out on a proposed school building.The new naíscoil is expected to open in September this year and will pave the way for an Irish-medium primary in the area in .Gaelscoil an Aodha Dhuibh faced a setback recently after a lease on the proposed nursery site fell through. However, committee member Suzanne Warring said she is confident it will open as planned.“We’re looking at everything that is available in the whole postcode,” she said.“There are very few commercial properties in the area, but we have seen everything that there is, so we’re reaching out to everyone to make sure we get an appropriate site. “At this stage we are still confident we will be opening in September. My daughter is one of the ones who will be going to the school in September and we certainly expect that to happen. Over the next couple of weeks we hope to get the building secured and then we will have enough time to prepare. Because we have the money in place and all of the groundwork has been done in advance, we should be able to open as planned.”According to Ms Warring, the naíscoil has already had an unprecedented amount of applications, which are indicative of a growing demand for Irish-medium education in the area.“It is massively encouraging,” she enthused.“To think that your kids can go to a local naíscoil, bunscoil, or meánscoil in the future is fantastic. It really shows how much things have changed here. The naiscoil is the start and we hope to build on that. We’re trying to build a community around it. There are a lot more Irish speakers in the area than we would have known and it will create a place for those people, and for those who just want to learn.”She continued: “Because of the non-denominational ethos of Irish medium education, we welcome applications from everyone in the community and the inclusive, child-centred nature of Irish medium is exactly what the area needs. “We had an amazing turnout at The Ivanhoe in December for our information morning. Many parents don#t have Irish themselves but we know from the success of our existing Gaelscoileanna that this is not an issue. “The momentum is there and the funding is ready to go. “The committee is working diligently to secure suitable premises to open the doors in September  as planned. We would welcome input from anyone with suitable premises or sites to get in touch so that we can make this vision a reality.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News Councillor Baker said the service willas of Wednesday and Thursday this week, but that there will be no evening service on Friday or Saturday night.Mr Baker said he will also be walking the bus route and “jumping on and off the shuttle buses over the next two nights” to restore confidence in the service. “A lot of work has been going on behind the scenes since the service was pulled last week,” he said. “Everyone has got involved to have this restored. “We need this vital service back. We have to be aware that driver safety, passenger safety is what is important it’s about building confidence. I have to be on the ground with inspectors to build up that confidence. “If anything happens at least I am there, I can identy people because at the end of the day what is happening here is a serious offence, young people could end up with a criminal record here,” he said. “We are looking towards sustainability, working together with the community, Translink, the union, working on a strategy to prevent this from happening ever again. The impact since the service was pulled has been huge. “It’s a one-mile walk from the bottom of Lagmore never mind the safety aspect at night. It’s a service we really need but it’s about making sure the drivers and Translink staff are safe doing their job.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"seamuss inside story of life on the blanket","story":"THE COURSE of Irish history has been marked by insurrection against British rule. The impacts of the ious campaigns have been extensively debated, but certain events, such as the republican struggle against criminalisation in the H-Blocks and Armagh Gaol, are almost universally recognised as catalytic in effecting social change. While we know the blanket protest and the deaths of  men on hunger strike would completely alter the political landscape in Ireland, the lived experiences of the blanket men and women and the horror they endured is much harder to comprehend.As part of wider effort to tell the prisoners’ stories, ex-prisoner Seamus Kearney, who is one of hundreds of people who experienced the ordeal of the H-Blocks, is set to give a talk on his time in prison in St Gall’s GAC on Friday.Seamus was arrested during an IRA operation in Finaghy Road North and was imprisoned in January . He was placed on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol where he admits he was looking forward to some rest after years of struggle, but he didn’t know what to expect.His imprisonment coincided with the building of the H-Blocks, where the first blanket man, Kieran Nugent, had begun his protest against criminalisation just three months earlier. At that time, however, Seamus said, “Nobody knew what way the jails were going.” Indeed, during an early encounter with Kieran Doherty, who would die on hunger strike in , he was informed that his comrades were “disappearing off the face of the earth” after sentence. After his own sentencing, Seamus was moved from the Crumlin Road to H-Block  in June . It was there that he first met future hunger strikers Kevin Lynch, Thomas McElwee and the then block OC, Bobby Sands. During their short time in H, which was then used as a transitional block, Seamus and his comrades resolved to join the blanket protest. Non-conformity meant being locked in a cell for  hours a day and a ‘Number ’ starvation diet.“After refusing a unorm you were told to strip ‘everything’,” he said. “It was all men looking at you, so it was a bit weird. They put the clothes into a brown bag and I remember thinking to myself ‘I’m going to get them back.’“It seemed quite daunting because I thought I was getting some R and R,” he added.“We ended up in H and took each day as it came. One day led to another. Your legs start getting tingly from the lack of exercise, but the idea was to keep walking to keep moving. “After a few months, we were lucky, because at the end of January  Brendan Hughes, ‘The Dark’, arrived. I ended up in cell next to him. Bobby ended up at the far wing of H. Getting Brendan Hughes was amazing. He was already a hero, even then.”According to Seamus, the arrival of Brendan Hughes, who took up command in the blocks, was pivotal in the escalation of the prison protests. The blanket men were isolated from the outside world and the British government was “winning the propaganda war”, but with the men voting in favour of Brendan Hughes’ idea of no-wash protest in February , the protest began gaining public attention.“We needed to recalibrate,” Seamus said.“It was then that we were told that this was not a local jail dispute. This was a part of governmental policy and that it was bigger than we thought. I think the Brits thought we weren’t of the same calibre of Connolly or Pearse – that we would do what we were told. But they were wrong. They were hitting a raw nerve and they didn’t realise it, and maybe we didn’t. We weren’t thinking about what it all meant, but our backs were against the wall.”Seamus continued: “It was about attracting national international interest. We had to open new lines of communication to the outside world and get our story out there, because at that time they were winning the propaganda war.“We were already getting harassed on the way out of our cells, so The Dark said we were going to exploit that going into the no-wash protest. The screws were already beating some of the lads. You were going out one cell at a time and it was one man being hit by about  screws.”Seamus was soon moved to H where he lost Brendan Hughes’ counsel, but said he and his comrades were emboldened at the onset of the no-wash protest. Their ingenuity in sending communications within the blocks and to the outside world is now legendary. It was during that time, amid increasing brutality from the screws, that the prisoners took the decision to smear excrement on walls – a decision that Seamus said was taken reluctantly.“We didn’t know how we would even do it – the mechanics of it,” he said.“We were improvising again. Some bright spark, Tom Martin, had the idea of taking a piece of the mattress and using it as a sponge. That seemed to be the only way to do it. Eventually we did it together. We started smearing it on the wall – it was horrible. After about two weeks the screws went ballistic. I remember the screw opening the cell door and saying ‘you dirty bastards – you fucking animals.’ I think that’s when the real hatred started forming. We didn’t feel good about putting it up anyway. We weren’t animals, but we felt that we had to do it to highlight the case.”Seamus recalls  as bad year for the blanket men, particularly in ‘an seachtain dona’of April that year, when “people were literally beaten off the blanket”. He said the remaining blanket men were determined to “save the IRA from obliteration” and, often, it was comedy that got them through. While you were getting beaten you were still laughing,” he recalled. Seamus tells with a smile of a visit from an old neighbour who cajoled him into singing ‘Smoke Gets in Your Eyes’ by Bryan Ferry – a move that brought applause from the visiting room and, later, a beating from the screws. Needless to say, she never visited again.While the torture endured by the blanket men was immense, Seamus faced one of his toughest challenges when he received word that the IRA had executed his brother, Michael Kearney, as an informer in July . The screws initially mocked his brother’s death, but later offered supposed salvation and a chance to leave the blanket. Michael’s name would not be cleared until  when it was revealed that he had been killed at the behest of IRA informant Freddie Scappaticci, codename Stakekne. However, Seamus remained undaunting in his commitment to the IRA during his  years in prison. “I gave him my blessing to join the IRA,” he said.“I felt he betrayed me and he betrayed Ireland. I didn’t know what I was going to do. Everything stood still.“I was in the middle of no-man’s land. I was neither with the IRA or the British and I felt shell-shocked. The first thing that went through my mind was ‘What am I going to tell the lads ’“It was the first time I realised the distinction between mind and body, which you’ll not understand until it happens,” he added.“My body was telling me I’d had enough – I was starving, I had lice, I had dysentery – but my mind was saying, ‘Tell themto fuck off.’ “I told them I had lots of brothers. There were  of them, one of them was dead, but I had Sean on the outside and I had brothers in the H-Blocks.“I told the lads that the only way they would take me out isthey carried me out. They weren’t going to break the back of the IRA.”The H-Blocks saw a hunger strike in  that saw the British government renege on a deal it had struck with the prisoners. Tragically,  men – Bobby Sands, Francis Hughes, Raymond McCreesh, Patsy O’Hara, Joe McDonnell, Martin Hurson, Kevin Lynch, Kieran Doherty, Thomas McElwee and Michael Devine – died on hunger strike the following year. Of the  that died, Seamus knew six of them personally, and he vividly recalls the last time he saw Bobby Sands during Mass in February .“At the end of the Mass Bobby went round the lads clockwise,” he said.“He came to me and smiled and said ‘I see you’re still here,’ and I knew it was in relation to our Michael. I said ‘There’s nowhere  to go, Bobby.’ He looked straight into my eyes and said ‘Good man – goodbye.’“I had doubted him. Most of our wing had doubted him. To me he was just like a Rod Stewart lookalike. I had given him the words to ‘This Old Heart of Mine’ before – he liked that song. When I looked into his eyes that Sunday they were like a shark’s eyes. He had resigned himself and I knew he was going to go through with.“The hunger strike was a formality. Bobby didn’t really die on May the th – he died in February. One after another they died and it was like losing a part of yourself. It was the same reaction I had to losing our Michael. It was like losing brothers. It was so catastrophic – and it still is. “Maybe it’s a physiological thing that I don’t understand, but when I talk about it I can still feel that emotion asit was yesterday and I still struggle to get over it. I know I speak for a lot of the lads who can’t have this conversation, but something broke inside me.”Those who knew the men who died most keenly feel the sadness of . For Seamus, the death of his friend Thomas McElwee, who he knew from H, was most dficult of all, and one that he finds most painful to speak about. He talks about his friend fondly, and will no doubt do so as he tells his own chapter in the dramatic account of the blanket men. “You are trying to bring people into that world and a lot of the lads can’t talk about it – most of them don’t,” he said.“For me, you don’t just talk about the protest, you actually relive it. Once you open that Pandora’s box you don’t know what you’re letting out, so a lot of the lads keep it closed.“Today, with the rise of Sinn Féin, the republican movement is healthy. It is a direct result of the fight against criminalisation. We thought it would be a footnote in Irish history, but it became a pivotal moment. Of the ten men who died on hunger strike I knew six of them personally. It was such an intimate death for all of them that it’s dficult to talk about.”Seamus will give his talk about le on the blanket in St Galls GAC this Friday evening, March , at .pm. All are welcome to come along."},{"url":null,"title":"how ireland rugby hero jacob stockdale tackles being christian in rugby world","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I am a leader there with the youth group.\"Reflecting on his childhood, the player said there is a \"certain expectation placed on the children of ministers, but that he \"enjoyed\" the experience as he \"always had somewhere to live, a community to be part of\".\"But there is also the other side of it - youre expected to be this perfect child and when you dont live up to the ideal it results in rumours and I was always aware of that,\" he said. He added that his \"first real profession\" of his Christian faith was at a summer camp when he was . Revealing that he was \"pretty small\" until a growth spurt at , Jacob said the fact that he had a \"bit of a late start\" in rugby meant he focused on other things such as school work, becoming \"more of an all-rounded person, to a certain extent\"."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for checkpoints on irish border arlene foster","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSpring EditionHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It called the case a “severe political incident” and said the United States and Canada were abusing their extradition treaty.China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on December  in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.Fact: the Authority to Proceed is the first step in the extradition process.

Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.The US and China have tried to keep Meng’s case separate from their wider trade dispute, but President Donald Trump has undercut that intent, saying he would consider intervening in the case against Mengit would be in the interest of US national security or help forge a trade deal with Beijing.“Judging from the obvious political interference presented on this case,Canada really abides by the principle of rule of law and judiciary independence, the Canadian side should refuse the extradition request of the United States and immediately release Ms Meng Wanzhou,” the Chinese embassy added.US Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the Justice Department pursues cases “free of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges”."},{"url":null,"title":"british parliament locked delusional bubble brexit mccallion","story":"The British Parliament is locked in a \"delusional bubble\" where it cannot decideit even wants a Brexit deal or not, Sinn Fein Foyle MLA Elisha McCallion has said.

And, it was just before his arrival in Derry for the visit that he learned of the surfacing of the British document in question.In August,  Martin Galvin led a group of  Americans on a fact-finding tour of the North organised by Sinn Fein. The tour included a two-day tour of Derry.The arrival of the U.S. delegation attracted major press coverage in Ireland and America. The visit also coincided with the annual anti-internment rallies after which British Minister Nicholas Scott, a close associate of Margaret Thatcher, issued a public statement saying he regretted not being given the opportunity to speak to the U.S. contingent and set them straight.Martin Galvin said: \"We immediately replied that were still in the north and were willing and available to meet with the British official.\"But, Scott was immediately recalled back to London from Belfast and a statement was released that British officials did not speak to anyone affiliated with Irish Northern Aid, or who believed that IRA resistance to British rule at the time and in those circumstances was morally legitimate.\"However, Unioinist MP Martyn Smyth appeared with me on a UTV program and said our tour represented a blinkered view of the conflict because the delegation hadnt met with British officials or unionists.\"The following year, Martin Galvin, by then editor of an Irish-American newspaper in New York, organised a second tour which this time consisted of  Americans. It was again planned to coincide with an anti-interment rally on August , .Martin Galvin continued: \"On July ,  I wrote a letter from my office at the Irish People, offering the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and unionist leaders an opportunity to speak to us at a mutually agreed time and venue. It was a genuine offer made in response to both Nicholas Scotts and Rev Smyths public comments the year before.\"However, the British response to the offer to talk was to have then Home Secretary Leon Brittan issue an Exclusion Order against Martin Galvin at Cabinet level on the eve of the American delegations arrival in Ireland.\"Its been speculated that the ban was payback because I was in charge of American support for the hunger strikers in . But, a pretext was also added that months before at the rededication of the United Irishmen Roddy McCorley monument in Toome I had made a fairly commonplace remark that I was glad there were still men and women who carried on in the spirit of Roddy McCorley to be free,\" Martin Galvin said.However, the recent emergence of a previously classied Northern Ireland Officememo dated July ,  makes no reference to an exclusion order nor any concerns about allegedly inflammatory remarks in support of the IRA campaign from Galvin.The Exclusion Order against the American was however issued the next day-July , .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe NIO memo, signed by a JM Lyon, states: \"You may have seen that Martin Galvin had secured some publicity for his request to the Secretary of State and the Unionist parties for a meeting with the NORAID party when they visit Northern Ireland next month.\"I suggest the letter receive a short Private Secretary reply.\"I suggest Mr Barriemight inform Washington of this correspondence and let them know the terms of our reply when it has been sent.\"I suggest we do not ourselves issue the text to the press either here or in America, but should make it availableasked with the thought that this is a propaganda ploy at its most transparent.\"In view of the imminence of the visit, it would be helpfulcolleagues could let me have any comments, by telephone inconvenient, by close of business on  July.\"Martin Galvin said: \"Instead of intimidating or silencing the delegation the ban had the opposite reaction. Sinn Fein leaders had learned of the ban and told me it was important that I defied it because it would highlight censorship.\"I agreed to defy the ban and I was photographed in Derry beside Martin McGuinness to prove Id been in the North.\"When we went onto Belfast on August , the RUC had planned a brutal retaliation. Gerry Adams called me onto the  to speak at the anti-internment rally the RUC immediately fired plastic bullets and baton charged a peaceful crowd. They murdered Sean Downes and injured many more.\"But, like Bloody Sunday, the number of cameras, journalists and witnesses meant that British violence couldnt be covered up.\"The following year, , Galvin again defied the ban and appeared in Derry once more carrying the coffin of an IRA member.And, in August  on the th anniversary of the arrival of British troops in Derry, Martin Galvin was arrested at Free Derry Corner whilst accompanied by Martin McGuinness.After being held at Strand Road RUC barracks he was shipped to a military base in England before being deported to Washington on a British military aircraft.\"It after this incident that the British Government announced that the Exclusion Order was being withdrawn. Ironically, I was told of this by Denis Donaldson who had been sent to America and who was obviously targeting me.\"Speaking of the -year-old episode, Martin Galvin told the Derry News: \"The ban against me was simply one more of the countless examples of British officials imposing petty and arrogant policies behind some noble cover story and then being surprised that anyone would refuse to bow to their edicts.\"We were trying to show Americans what British rule was like for nationalists in the six counties.\"I think its ironic that I was made aware of this British document just as I was traveling to Derry with another American delegation.

Its time to get Justice for Mobuoy!”‘Subject to funding’When asked what would need to be done to make the area safe and prevent any risk of contaminating the DAERA said would be dependent on funding.A spokesperson explained: “The Northern Environment Agency has agreed an integrated approach for remediating the Mobuoy illegal waste sites that takes full account of the need to protect the River Faughan.“At this stage DAERA through the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, is seeking to enforce the former operators to remediate. In parallel to this, DAERA is developing a signicant business case to support remediation of the site.“The solution is not a simple one. The protection of the River Faughan needs to be managed through a remediation programme that comprises of several complementary phases in which there are a number of treatments on site within each phase of works. All elements of this programme will need to be supported by an extensive environmental monitoring programme.“At this stage, the remediation programme is subject to DAERA securing funding for the preparatory works required prior to remediation commencing on site.”Further detail will be presented by NIEA to the local community at an event on Wednesday th March at .pm in Drumahoe Primary School.Photo: Environmental Campaigners Paul Hughes  Eamonn ODonnell at the Environmental Gathering rally in Derry last October."},{"url":null,"title":"people profit accuses sinn fein touch reality welfare reforms","story":"People Before Profit has accused Sinn Féin of being out of touch with the reality of welfare reforms.People Before Profit candidate for Foyleside Shaun Harkin said Universal Credit has left people in debt and poverty, while denying thousands disability benefits.He commented: \"Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan has called for the Department of Communities to ensure welfare mitigations continue.

It was more singer songwriter, folky stuff.ldquoIt wasnrsquot really a surprise to me as the stuff I would have listened to outside my giging would have been the likes of Bob Dylan and Steve Earle.Conal is recording his new songs with the band Stillwater, which also features Killyleagh musician Damien Hanna.While he is experiencing a creative purple patch, the father-of-four does not yet know when the music will be available.ldquoI donrsquot have a title for my new EP yet as Irsquom still writing and Irsquom still recording. I would hope that the EP would be out by the summer and the album by the end of the year but you never know, the EP could turn into the album.He and Stillwater performed two of Conalrsquos new tracks, Venus and All of the People, in an interview on That Like That on NVTV.Conal says that the second track is really resonating with people.ldquoThis track is aimed at society in general, not only young people on Facebook, but all those who point the finger at somebody and gang up on some poor soul, he explained.ldquoThen when something happens to that poor soul, then yoursquoll get the smiley faces and comments of lsquoHe was a great fellarsquo or lsquoShe was a great girlrsquo and hopefully it teaches them a lesson to realise what people might be going through on the inside.Conal is a regular at Denvirrsquos in Downpatrick and will next perform with Stillwater in Portrush Town Hall at the North West  in MayTo watch Conalrsquos interview and performance on NVTVrsquos Talk Like That visit twww.nvtv shows talk-like-that-conal-montgomery Conal and Stillwater on their Facebook pages or ring Conal on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"De La Salle head ‘disappointed’ at decision  ","story":"THE principal of De La Salle School in Downpatrick has spoken of his ldquodisappointment in this weekrsquos statement from the Red High Parents and Friends Association.Mr Ciaran Maguire called on all four schools earmarked for the proposed lsquosuper schoolrsquo in Downpatrick ldquoto come together and put their best foot forward.Mr Maguire said he was disappointed for the trustees of De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos, who ldquohave given so much of their lives to the families in East Down.He described their involvement in education has been one of ldquogreat success and achievement.Mr Maguire said De La Salle and St Patrickrsquos were ldquotwo highly effective schools meeting the needs of young men and women in the greater Downpatrick area.He said the trustees had the confidence of staff, pupils and parents at De La Salle and from the wider business community.Mr Maguire remarked: ldquoWithin my last two years as principal of De La Salle, I have witnessed on a daily basis children going to and from St Patrickrsquos, to St Maryrsquos to De La Salle, accessing a curriculum that isnrsquot possible within their own school and sharing both the knowledge and expertise from each of these schools, where the results have been nothing short of excellent for each pupil.ldquoThis collaboration has been up and running successfully for years and is a model of good practice for other post-primary schools to see.ldquoWhat is wrong in having a rsquosuper schoolrsquo  Do the families in the greater Downpatrick area not deserve it  A school where children regardless of ability can achieve their potential He continued: ldquoThe new school will cater for every child.

Longford settled first and leading marksman Darren Gallagher registered the first score with a free in the fourth minute, but despite a lot of possession, the home side struggled to get scores on the board.Downrsquos defensive cover was superb with Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty making a more than impressive debut at half back.He received great support from Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Castlewellanrsquos Colm Flanagan and Bryansfordrsquos Ruairi Wells as Down closed up shop.Mind you, Down also struggled early on to get scores, but all that changed in the th minute.A measured long ball in from Caolan Mooney was ruthlessly pounced upon by OrsquoHare and he finished to the net with panache.Points from Gallagherand Liam Connerton drew Longford level in the th minute, but Down responded in style and regained the initiative with unanswered points from OrsquoHare , Conor Poland and corner back Gerard Collins.Longford had a goal chance in the th minute when Darren Quinn carved out an opening for the lurking Gallagher, but Burns made am outstanding save to deny the danger man and send Down in at the break with a - to - lead.Paddy Tallyrsquos men stretched their lead to seven within one minute of the second half when another long ball in, this time from Poland, picked out OrsquoHare and he grabbed his and his sidersquos second goal.Longford got a much needed point from Connor Berry in the th minute, but minutes later Burns denied Gallagher. Longford were made to rue those missed goal chances in the th minute when Jerome Johnston found Daniel Guinness and he played it to OrsquoHare who got his third goal.Berry kicked over a free in the th minute and two minutes later Longford had a chance for a goal when they were awarded a penalty after Quinn was fouled. Up stepped Gallagher, but his spot-kick was pushed out for a rsquo by the brilliant Burns. Gallagher made no mistake with the rsquo, but Longford really needed a goal at this stage.Jerome Johnstonand Daniel Guinness added points to their score while Longford got consolation points from Gallagher and Connerton.Down are now level on points with Louth, but behind on score dference.

Taking part in the mass were Canon Sean Rogan, who is a former school governor, family friend Fr Seamus McGinley and Diocesan priest Canon Noel Conway.Among those attending were Mr Eamonn McGrady, chairman of the schoolrsquos board of governors, and Mrs Darlingrsquos husband, Martin.Mrs Darling is leaving the school in the equally capable hands of the incoming principal, Miss Rosemary McLoughlin, who is the current vice-principal.Having worked at St Maryrsquos since , Miss McLoughlin is the perfect person to steward the school over the next few years as St Maryrsquos faces the prospect of joining the new lsquosuper schoolrsquo proposed by the CCMS for Downpatrick for .Itrsquos a challenge that Mrs Darling wishes she was around to oversee.ldquoRetiring is something thatrsquos really quite bittersweet for me because I will really miss the school and everyone here, and seeing the girls every morning, said Mrs Darling.ldquoBut of course I wonrsquot miss the administration. I actually thought of leaving last year but as we had our th anniversary I wasnrsquot going to leave before I had handled all of that.ldquoI think itrsquos nice for a principal to take over a school a little bit before the begining of an academic year.She sees the proposed new lsquosuper schoolrsquo as a great opportunity for the school and its students.ldquoI would have absolutely loved the challenge to ensure that every single child going into that school would be properly catered for and would be treated respectfully and fairly, she said.ldquoNot only our girls but that the children from the other schools would be treated equally and fairly.When Mrs Darling looks at her students, she unrelentingly sees promise and potential in each and every one and makes no apology for it.She is well-known for her high expectations for the students.ldquoI believe I have helped the children here to raise their aspirations, to hold their heads up high, be proud of who they are and realise that they are as good as anyone , that they are capable of being successful in their own right and to bring that success to their families and their communities, said Mrs Darling.ldquoOur children in this school have seen GCSE and A-Level results increase year on year. They know that I expect them to achieve. I expect them to work hard and to keep going until they get it right and until they get to where they want to be.ldquoTheir parents have been a wonderful support to me as a principal. They have been very engaged and we have travelled the same path together. We have built a very constructive partnership to support their children to be the very best they can be.ldquoItrsquos very important to me that every child coming through the door of this school know that they are valued, they are cherished and that they are provided with a first-class education, to progress and to be the best that they can be.Mrs Darling speaks highly of her teaching staff and all the staff who help make St Maryrsquos the school it is today.ldquoI was very warmly welcomed into the Downpatrick area and the parents were extremely supportive. We have a wonderful board of governors who have been very supportive in working with me and the vision I had for the school and Irsquom very fortunate to have had the staff that I had, she added.Like many other teachers, she was called into education due to being inspired by her own teachers from Newtownhamilton in Co Armagh where she was raised.ldquoI always wanted to be a teacher, recalled Mrs Darling. ldquoI think I was fortunate to have wonderful teachers as a pupil and was really inspired by many of them.

But then I have really enjoyed the drive through the Mournes in the sunlight. It can be absolutely glorious. The sunrises are amazing, as are the sunsets, and I have seen both of them on working days.Retirement will give her and her husband a chance to travel and spend more time with their daughter and son who live in Boston and London respectively, and to increase her leisure activities.ldquoI donrsquot intend to sit on a chair, she said. ldquoI will be working with a number of charities to support them and I certainly hope I will be in a position to make a dference in some of the charities.ldquoI hope to work with Sister Consilio [who runs an addiction treatment centre] with her work in Downpatrick.ldquoFrom my perspective, it enables me to carry on the Mercy tradition which is so tangible in this school plus I have worked in this community for eight and a half years and I want to give back.Her parting words to the school and colleagues were: ldquoI have always wanted every child in this school to feel they really do matter, that they will be cared for here and their lives will be enriched by the experiences they have here..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Programme of events to mark St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"THE countdown is on to this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations in Downpatrick.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has lined up a wide range of events, concerts and activities, culminating in the annual cross community parade which will take place on Sunday, March  mdash despite the fact that the major religious events in honour of the patron saint have been switched to the following day.Earlier this month, the Recorder revealed that a number of traders in Downpatrick were angry that the decision to hold the carnival parade on the Sunday was taken without consulting them.With March  falling on the Sabbath, the annual St Patrickrsquos pilgrimage walk from Saul Church into the centre of the town and the traditional cross-community ecumenical service at Down Cathedral will both take place on the following day.The flagship Downpatrick carnival parade has been held before on a Sunday when the former Down Council was the organiser but previously when St Patricks Day fell on a Sunday, the cross-community spectacular has been moved to the day after.The decision to hold the Downpatrick parade on March  means the town will now host two major events on the same day, with the hugely popular Jimmys K road race taking place in the morning ahead of the festival parade starting at pm.Three weeks ago traders said Downpatrick is always busy in the lead-up to the parade with the majority of themdoing relatively well on what is the townrsquos busiest day of the year in attracting visitors.Some in the business community argue that traders will ldquolose out as the parade is taking place on Sunday as the majority will not have the opportunity to enjoy the same income they would expectthe event was held on a Saturday or Monday.Several traders said they were not surprised that council officials did not consult them before making a decision to hold the cross-community parade on the Sunday.

The five recordings were found on a USB pen discovered in a classroom in November . The then schoolboy later admitted it was his and that he had made the recordings.According to the NASUWT, he was suspended for his actions in December , but permitted toto school the following month with a management plan in place.The following year, despite his past history, he was made a prefect of moving image arts – a move which led to grievances being lodged by the union on behalf of the two teachers.It is understood  was the first year that all upper sixth pupils at the school were made prefects.One teacher at the school, who didn’t want to be identied, said: “He could have been made a prefect of any subject he studied at A Level. He could have been made a prefect of the library or whatever, but they made him prefect of moving image arts. It was quite shocking.”Justin McCamphill, NASUWT national official for Northern Ireland, commented: “The school knew he had videoed under the skirts of teachers, yet they still decided to make him a prefect for this subject and that has added to the hurt felt by our members.Momo: children ‘crying in fear’ over internet hoax Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The school has let these teachers down. They have refused to acknowledge the gravity of the situation from early on.”His colleague, policy and casework officer Maxine Murphy-Higgins, insists the school should have expelled Boomer for his actions. “I think the school should issue a public apology,” she said.The News Letter submitted a series of questions to Enniskillen Royal Grammar, including askingthe school thought it was appropriate to make Boomer a prefect of moving image arts why he wasn’t stripped of the title or made prefect of a dferent subject when the teachers’ complaint was raised andit would be making a public apology to the two teachers.Declining to answer the questions, school principal Elizabeth Armstrong said: “As this matter is still subject to proceedings it would not be appropriate for the school to make any comment.”try catch  TrendingNew national anthem for Northern Ireland gets the thumbs upMomo contacts N.I. man -

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal.

But in contrast to a fortnight ago, this House has made it clear what it needs to approve a withdrawal agreement.\"Mrs May said she would seek \"legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that deal with concerns on the backstop while guaranteeing noto a hard border\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The deaths has been reported to the coroner.It comes as almost , patient accidents or falls were reported between November  and December .Of the five unexpected deaths to patients known to mental health services, one was found hanging at home but the cause of deaths of the other patients are not yet confirmed.One dental patient was diagnosed withsquamous cell carcinoma ndash a form of skin cancer ndash having previously been downgraded from urgent to routine.Another patient suffered a stroke after ldquofollow-up processes were not followed and had not started blood thinning treatment, while another patient died whilst on the cardiac surgery waiting list.In another serious incident, an eye disorder patientrsquos sight ldquodeteriorated signicantly after not being offered a follow-up appointment.A regulation  report ndash which is sent to organisations when a coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent further deaths ndash has also been sent to the health board since the end of November.The report relates to an inquest in which the coroner concluded that a patient died after taking a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication on an in-patient ward at University Hospital of Wales.The medication was not locked away in his bedside cupboard, which contravened the medicines code patient property policies, a health board report says.The health board report says: ldquoThe management of patientrsquos own medication is one which presents a particular challenge in the healthcare environment. Following the incident the UHB has carried out a benchmarking exercise across the UK and it does not appear that there is anyone centre that has managed to put an effective solution in place.ldquoWhile patients are always encouraged to hand over all medication or to send it home with family, there are many practical issues that make this dficult to implement and monitor robustly. Medication is the patientrsquos own property and they can refuse to hand it over should they wish. Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The decision was made by Department of Justice Canada officials, who are part of a non-partisan public service. #MengWanzhou https:t.co DekpRoGrp pic hSODtUIRmdash Justice CanadaMarch , A Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a -year prison term handed down earlier.Kovrig and Spavor have not had access to a lawyer since being arrested.Meng is out on bail in Canada and living in one of her two Vancouver mansions awaiting extradition proceedings.David Martin, Mengrsquos lawyer, said in a statement: ldquoWe are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the US charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms Mengrsquos casehe thought it would assist the US negotiations with China over a trade deal.Mr Martin also said the charges against Meng are not crimes in Canada and that his client maintains her innocence.Chinarsquos embassy said it was ldquoutterly dissatisfied.ldquoThis is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise, the embassy said in a statement.Huawei, the biggest global supplier of network gear for phone and internet companies, is a focus of US security concerns. Washington has pressured other countries to limit use of its technology, warning they could be opening themselves up to surveillance and theft of information.The US and China have tried to keep Mengrsquos case separate from their wider trade dispute, but President Donald Trump has undercut that intent, saying he would consider intervening in the case against Mengit would be in the interest of US national security or help forge a trade deal with Beijing.ldquoJudging from the obvious political interference presented on this case,Canada really abides by the principle of rule of law and judiciary independence, the Canadian side should refuse the extradition request of the United States and immediately release Ms Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese embassy added.US Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the Justice Department pursues cases ldquofree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Canada allows extradition case against Huawei boss to proceed article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Whilst there needs to be a greater emphasis on catching those responsible, we just cannot let the stuff lie there, it must be cleaned up.Praising environmental health staff, Cllr McAlinden explained that while it is the responsibility of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, this advice from the HSE’s advice has caused problems.“The SDLP council group has raised this issue and have met with the Council’s director and senior officials to discuss this very issue. I was astonished to learn that new advice from the Health and Safety Executive is apparently the reason why we cannot get our roads cleaned.“The official advice is to ensure that when staff or contractors are litter picking along roads there must be a set clearance area between operatives and vehicles using the road.“In its most simple terms, we could see our main roads coned off or even closed off completely just to enable litter to be cleared.”Councillor McAlinden added: “Officers across the councils are challenging this guidance and that staff involved in the work think it’s madness.”“The health and safety of our staff and contractors are vital, but this guidance is overkill.”“It could and will see litter stacked up on roadsides and will ramp up the costs of clearing it when the issue is settled. I just hope common sense prevails and that some action can be taken in the interim.”Rail crossing at Lurgan to close all weekend Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT |

As a former pupil of St Patrick’s College in Armagh, Frankie became fully involved with its past pupil society. In his youth, he played for several local teams around Lurgan. He was a member of Clan Na Gael’s  Championship team as a -year-old, later becoming a valued member with Wolf Tones in Derrymacash. Frankie joined the family business, which had become a wholesale wines and spirit company, Terence McKeown  Sons. Indeed he spent the rest of his working le helping to grow this into a highly successful company as Managing Director. It eventually grew into Rehill McKeown, based for a while in premises in Mary St, Lurgan, then to purpose-built premises in Annesborough Industrial Estate. He expanded the business into off licenses and later purchased MrErlains bakery in Belfast. The company was sold to CC in the late ’s. Frankie was highly respected in the business world. He was deemed a gentleman who was wise and generous with his time, helping clients and staff.He was also part of the local Rotary and then Probus Club. Frankie also had a passion for golf and was a member of Lurgan Golf Club since the early ’s. His proudest accolades included becoming a Captain in the early ’s and then President in early ’s.Indeed he was involved in the club until very recently.

His favourite venture was the ownership of a horse that would be called Church Place, as in the location in Lurgan. Frankie would regularly attend Fairyhouse, the Maze and many other Irish venues. In a tribute, Frankie’s brother Donagh said: “When you know someone who has been part of your le for all of your le, you have many memories and good times to recall. “From childhood Frankie was around, and perhaps because of the age dference, could easily and often was seen as my father. Indeed, from the age of  when my father died, he most definitely indirectly inherited the role. He was always caring, sometimes a little stern, though for the best reason, to instill a little discipline in a young boy’s le, only with a word, I should quickly add.“It was his love for sport that we shared a joint passion, that began with a ‘kick around” in Silverwood. Always the competitive type, he occasionally let this young boy win. “When he and Bridie got married, the two would temporarily adopt myself and younger sister Aideen as their own, before having their own children. By then I became a useful babysitter from time to time. “Their door was always open and we were always welcome for family occasions. Boxing Day night was always a special time for wider family get togethers with the extended family.“It’s taken me a couple of days to be able to write my thoughts about Frankie’s passing. It will take me quite a few more to come to terms with it, even though I’ve known for a while that these days were coming. My family and friends will have many stories to tell, all tinged with personal sadness, though all with a common vein of how much fun he could be, how generous he was, how he truly cared for all, not just us, his own family.“A few years ago, I had the chance to make a short video for Frankie’s th birthday. I had a chance to make a few jokes, tell a few stories of his success in business and sport, and tell of his love of sport. Best of all though was to express something that I don’t think I really did over the previous  odd years I had known him. I said “Frankie,I never told you before, I’ll tell you now. I love you”Mr McKeown passed away peacefully at his home at Kiln Lane, Silverwood, Lurgan on February , .he was the beloved husband of Bridie and loving father of Mary , Anne , and Mel, father-in-law to Kevin, Eamonn and Geraldine, a cherished grandfather of Bronagh, Niamh, Fergal, Kate, Orla, and Grainne, dear brother of Maire, Patricia, Terence , Michael, Gerald, Diarmuid, Donagh, Aideen and the late Jim and Jackie.

But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.
