There is even a 38-stop route des fromages through the region, with road signs featuring cheese wheels directing drivers to 38 dairies and farm producers that make some of the country’s finest cheeses. Among the area’s most recognised contributions to French fromage are its blue cheeses of these, probably the best known to people in the UK is Saint Agur. This rich, tangy cheese is made in Beauzac, located beside the Loire in the Haute-Loire department, south-central France. It’s a “pretty, medieval village”, says Saint Agur’s fromagerie director Ludovic d’Eysmond, who describes a picturesque scene, where a church and ramparts “create a beautiful square in the centre of the village”. All of its milk comes from within 45 miles of the village, largely from farms in nearby hamlets, nestled on the side of the dormant volcanoes that are characteristic of the area’s terrain. Milk is provided by Montbéliarde cows, a breed prized among French cheesemakers because the protein levels of their milk produce higher yields of cheese than milk from other cows. They graze outside every other day, weather permitting. The heritage of Auvergne’s blue cheese dates back to the mid-1850s, when a local cheesemaker noticed the tastiness of the blue mould that would sometimes appear on his cheese curds. After experimenting, he realised that if he injected the mould, it would cause veining throughout the cheese. All of the area’s cheeses have characteristics that make them stand out inidually. Saint Agur is prized for the way it balances tangy notes with creamy, almost mushroom-like richness, whereas others are known for flavours that range from grassy notes that are almost woodlandy, through to borderline spiciness in some of the more powerfully moulded offerings. But one thing many of Auvergne’s better cheeses have in common is that they are ripened in some form of underground caves Saint Agur, for instance, spends 10 weeks in Beauzac caves. The rocks that create those special flavour-maturing conditions are largely volcanic, created by the dormant giants now covered in pasture that the cows graze upon.

Another area where fungi, particularly moulds, are important is in the production of popular foods. Soy sauce, fermented meats and cheeses are just some of the foods that owe their existence to mould. But it is in cheese, especially blue cheese, that mould plays its most recognised and, arguably, delicious role. The origins of blue cheese are vague, but the story goes that, in the seventh century, a shepherd in the southern French village of Roquefort (literally meaning “strong rock”) left his lunch of bread and sheep’s cheese in a cave when distracted by a local girl he saw in the distance. Many months later, the same shepherd apparently stumbled on his abandoned meal only to find it contaminated with Penicillium roqueforti, a mould that grew within the cave’s soil. It is not clear why the shepherd decided to consume his rediscovered meal, but since then Penicillium roqueforti has become a mould typically used in many blue cheese varieties, especially Saint Agur. The origins of blue cheese may be a myth, but the science of how Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavour of Saint Agur and all other blue cheeses is just as fascinating as any legend. What is mould? As with other fungi, mould is found in natural environments that are damp and rich in nutrients (forest soil, wood and, of course, caves). Moulds are decomposers, which means they break down organic materials that other species, such as invertebrates, struggle to digest. In doing so, they release into the soil soluble nutrients that plants and trees use to grow. Unlike plants, mould does not reproduce through seeds but rather spores, the dusty stuff that appears on top of mould, which floats through the air when released and begins to germinate when the microscopic particles land in hospitable environments. The spores then produce interwoven, thread-like structures known as hyphae, which become what are called mycelium when massed together. Mycelia are considered single organisms, but they can stretch underground for considerable distances. In fact, recent research has shown that the mycelia of some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant and tree roots, resulting in underground networks where the host plants can exchange nutrients, water and information. These networks are called mycorrhizae and are often likened to the internet and have been called the “wood wide web”. Their existence is forcing the scientific world to rethink their understanding of plants more generally. Penicillium roqueforti is part of the same genus (Penicillium) as the key mould species used in many modern antibiotics. First identified by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming as a potential agent in the fight against infection in 1928, it took another 10 years for a team of scientists at the University of Oxford to develop the world’s first antibiotic compounds from moulds such as Penicillium chrysogenum (sometimes known as Penicillium notatum) and Penicillium rubens. The mould itself does not kill bacteria but produces penicillin as a natural product, which attacks the cell walls of a wide range of bacteria. So what does this have to do with cheese?To create blue cheese, there are a variety of methods used by cheesemakers for different cheese types. Some still rely on mother nature and simply age their cheese in clement environments where the mould will naturally infect the wheels. Saint Agur, for instance, matures for 10 weeks in caves to allow for the mould to grow and give Saint Agur its unique taste and texture. Most manufactures, however, introduce powdered Penicillium roqueforti cultures to the cheese milk before the milk is coagulated and the curd is separated from the whey. Once the cheese has been moulded into shape, it is left to mature. It is at this point, in the early stages of the maturing process, that stainless steel rods are forced into the cheese to permit exchange between oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide produced by the mould in the cheese’s interior. This encourages the growth of mould and gives rise to the characteristic blue-green veins that run through this type of cheese. It is the presence of the mould and the enzymes it produces that are responsible for the colour, flavour and texture of the cheese. The mould raises the acidity (pH level) of the cheese, which changes its texture and flavour, while also breaking down proteins in the cheese to give it a softer, creamier consistency. The moulds also have a strong lipolytic action that breaks down fats, producing fatty acids, known as ketones, that give the cheese its rich flavour and powerful aroma. So next time you reach for some Saint Agur, remember that the mould has put a lot of work into making it the ideal companion for your crackers.

Mr A asked for an opinion about the big boat in the Suez canal instead, and I told him that opinions were my bread and butter and he’d have to festoon me with cash for those. He asked if it had to be money or would crisps do, and I said they’d do fine, then he threw crisps at me, only they missed by a mile. “It’s because they’re ridged,” he said. “Gah, I’m such an amateur! How can anybody predict the aerodynamics of a ridged crisp?” That wasn’t really the mishap, though, was it? We’d all forgotten how to socialise. Here we were, back at square one, like six-year-olds in a church hall, underneath their first glitterball, trying to work out what on earth to do next. Are we meant to be talking, or listening? Would music help? Should we reminisce, or anecdotalise? Should that thought stay in my head or come out of my mouth? That detail is definitely too light to share, but is that one too heavy? The human instinct for togetherness is very strong. Throwing crisps is actually the perfect ice-breaker. The next night, we were back in training, in someone else’s garden, flooded with yet more completely unfamiliar experiences: baking sunshine, food cooked by other people, Campari. Why is everything so delicious? I’ve forgotten some really basic stuff, like you have to pass food to others, not finish it. Just about all I can remember is that retelling the plot of whatever box set you’re watching doesn’t count as even low-quality chat. So why do I keep doing it? “It’s so long since I ate lamb in your garden,” I rhapsodised, then thought, wait, does that sound rude? Does it sound like I’m saying they always cook the same thing? Should I clarify that the last time, 18 months ago, it was butterflied, barbecued lamb, a totally different experience to this slow-cooked shoulder? Or should I just list everything great they’ve ever made that was not lamb? Would it be weird just how many things I could recall, over two decades, like I had an unnatural commitment to my own sensory pleasure? Maybe if I change the subject really fast, they won’t notice. “Did I tell you about my neighbour’s dog … ?” The collective excitement surged effortlessly over my nonsense. You could hear it echoed back at you from everyone else’s garden raucous intensity, then awkward silence, then everyone talking like a podcast on double speed, then a blanket of exhaustion. Surely it’s time to go home? It must be midnight. Actually, it was quarter to nine. 2021, the year when clocks went forward, then back, then forward again, multiple times a day. On Wednesday, we made lunch for another two dear and cherished friends who were barely recognisable under all that hair. Really if anyone had thought this road map through, the powers that be would have opened hairdressers first, and then people’s gardens right now we’re just taking it on trust that we know these people because they’ve arrived at the right time. We found our sea legs pretty well, bitching about shared acquaintances. Slagging people off is the riding-a-bike of the conversation world those muscles never atrophy. But of course we don’t have any new material, so we were mainly reprising the greatest hits from any given person’s back catalogue of flaws, and there is no natural end to that kind of delight. After we’d done a straight 90 minutes on a particular absent third-party, Mr Z – who had taken the week off work, and was in zooming-out mode, scanning the horizon, asking the important questions – said: “But what do you actually like about her?” “Well,” the friend replied, “she likes me. That’s the only reason I ever like anybody.” This is what’s going to get us through these early days, the painstaking re-establishment of what conversations count as normal, the ongoing enigmas (“how did I get so drunk?”) – that if there’s one thing more heartwarming than seeing someone else enjoy a thing, it’s when that thing they’re enjoying is your company."},{"url":null,"title":"while the tories dont rate starmer yet many dont fancy their own boss either","story":"An argument has been gaining currency in the party that Starmer’s pitch is as empty as the rooms where he records his video messages and sometimes takes PMQs. It’s a view shared by many Conservative MPs, who very rarely raise the threat posed by the Labour party when they shoot the breeze about the state of the political scene. This is largely because they do not perceive that there is a threat and feel it is unlikely things will change, even when Starmer is able to break out of his empty rooms. “He’s obviously twice as intelligent as Jeremy Corbyn – though of course that’s a low bar,” says one senior Conservative. “But I see Keir as maybe not even a Kinnock figure who sorts the party out but doesn’t make it to electoral victory himself, but more of a pre-Kinnock figure who does some of the groundwork.” Another Tory backbencher, who is by no means a fan of Boris Johnson, says the Labour party is “nowhere: we’re the ones providing all the opposition to the government”. Starmer spent the first few months of the pandemic presenting himself as the competent alternative to the government’s shambolic response to coronavirus. This seemed an entirely reasonable strategy, given the number of mistakes and avoidable rows that ministers and senior advisers kept inflicting on themselves. But things have changed. Now, the British government is seen as the envy of the world with its ability to roll out a successful vaccination programme and Johnson is able to accuse Starmer of dithering: “We vaccinate, he vacillates!” he cried at prime minister’s questions recently. Starmer’s identity as a competent leader seems less relevant now. And his forays into talking about British identity, making use of the union jack as a sign that he is proud of Britain, have felt strategic rather than sincere. Not making mistakes while sitting in front of a flag is hardly a pitch to set the world on fire, let alone give Labour a clear sense of identity. This past year has left both main parties with an identity crisis, though. I have never come across so many Tories who say they don’t feel at home in their party at present, even if they don’t plan to do much about that. For the Conservatives, this discomfort is partly because they have had to do so much big state stuff that they aren’t sure what the iding lines are with Labour any more. Even with the gradual lifting of the Covid restrictions that have caused so many liberal Tory types so much ideological angst, there is little relief: vaccine passports are now heaving into view and reigniting decades-old battles over government identity cards. But there is another reason for this lack of self-esteem and, as with Labour, it’s about the leader. Even though Boris Johnson is in his strongest position since the pandemic started, thanks again to that vaccination programme, he is not a typical Conservative and never has been. He has always been better than most of his colleagues at articulating why Conservatism makes sense: his columns as a journalist explaining competition, for instance, put ministers trying to implement policies enabling this to shame. But he is not an ideologue. Part of his success as mayor of London was down to his ability to take on traditional Labour policies, such as hikes in the minimum wage, housebuilding and so on. Most Conservatives like his ability to win big, but the means of doing so sometimes leave them feeling confused about whether, at heart, they really agree with their leader. They haven’t had much of a chance to get reassurance on this in the past year. As with Labour, Tory party meetings have taken place in the ether, with everyone joining Zoom calls from their own empty rooms. This has left even longstanding MPs saying they feel “disenfranchised” and that it is impossible to get ministers to take perfectly reasonable amendments to legislation seriously, merely because they don’t have the opportunity to buttonhole them in the voting lobbies. For the new intake, the problem is all the greater as they had just a few weeks after being elected to find their way from their office to the Commons chamber before they were sent home. Many of them don’t feel they’ve made friends, let alone forged proper links within the party. This is why the various caucuses within the party have become so influential and vocal. There are pressure groups on Covid, China, policies for the north, policies for women, one-nation Conservatism and many more. They obviously push their party in certain directions, but they also perform an important social role, functioning as the community that many MPs miss. One chair of a large party caucus notes: “A lot of people are turning up to our meetings each week just to hear someone else talking about politics.” Recently elected MPs say their membership of certain groups has replaced the interactions they’d expect to get in the tearooms. They have also realised that the sort of broadcast campaigning that the Northern Research Group has done is the only way to deal with the disenfranchisement that they feel: the usual channels for getting ministers to agree to extra pots of money for key seats have been severely damaged by the pandemic. The Northern Research Group doesn’t just ask Johnson for money: it also tells him he needs to speak to the longing for a sense of identity that many red wall voters have. And perhaps that was one of the ingredients in last week’s row about the report published by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. One northern MP observes: “This was one of those issues that has been heightened by the red wallblue wall situation that we have. This sort of thing is very popular, which is why ministers are always giving interviews in front of flags and threatening 10-year prison sentences for insulting statues.” Some Conservatives think the way the report was briefed, with a short summary released under strict embargo to reporters well before its detail was published, was inept. But most argue that this was a deliberate strategy from No 10 to ensure there was a drawn-out row about its conclusions. The bigger and longer the row, the more the voters who would agree with the conclusion that Britain is no longer institutionally racist will notice. This wasn’t the main aim behind the CRED report, though. It came from a belief, strongly held by figures such as the No 10 policy chief, Munira Mirza, and minister Kemi Badenoch, that the only way to make genuine progress on racial equality is to go on a clear offensive against the shibboleths of the left. They are happy to have this period of fighting – characterised as the “war on woke” – in the hope it will enable the government to really move on, rather than endlessly getting stuck in the weeds on ground held by the left. They have been particularly good at imitating the left’s habit of getting their people into key jobs. William Shawcross’s new role as reviewer of Prevent ruffled feathers recently, but a little-noted appointment last week was Robin Simcox as the replacement for Sara Khan in the countering extremism brief. Simcox hailed from the Reaganite conservative Heritage Foundation and will probably offer something the current Downing Street tribe are more comfortable with. Others in government favour a gentler approach to these sensitive issues. It’s not clear what Johnson himself thinks, but this is one of the ingredients in the Tory identity crisis: it’s rarely clear what he really believes. He prefers to play off rival ideological camps against one another in a “survival of the fittest” approach to policymaking. This does have the virtue of ensuring that his aides are always sharpening their arguments in order to win his backing. But it also means that internally government feels dysfunctional and outwardly can sound confused if rival camps start leaking against each other, which they often do. If those in the centre aren’t clear what the government is going to do next, what hope does the average Tory MP have? Politicians will start to filter back to Westminster in greater numbers after this Easter recess and as the empty corridors and meeting rooms fill up, both party leaders will have a chance to remind their flocks of what they stand for. It’s been a long year of starting fights in empty rooms. Soon, Starmer and Johnson will face the roar of the political crowd again. • Isabel Hardman is assistant editor of the Spectator and presenter of Radio 4’s Week in Westminster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9120e8f885d2ced2a4801f0264a5fa70f95662aa/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f3c16f59b20af14030852fc5228fc8fa","title":"number of gamblers trying to block themselves online surges","story":"The number of people who have signed up is on the verge of reaching 200,000, including 326 new registrations on 22 February, a record for a single day since the service was launched in 2018. Gamstop said the increase in efforts to avoid gambling appeared to have followed a rise in online betting volumes during November and December. It said this indicated that “the trend towards more online gambling may be leading to more vulnerable iniduals choosing to exclude themselves from all sites”. More people than ever may have signed up to the scheme, but Gamstop’s figures also demonstrate the difficulty that many people have in staying away from gambling. In January 2021, 49,328 people out of a possible 177,038 attempted to gamble and were stopped from doing so by their registration with Gamstop, which allows people to shut themselves out of internet gambling for a defined period. The organisation said this showed that blocking software was not a “silver bullet”. “With the rate of registrants continuing to rise, I would urge anybody putting self-exclusion from online gambling in place through Gamstop to also seek treatment,” the organisation’s chief executive, Fiona Palmer, said. “Awareness around self-exclusion schemes and blocking software has been increasing throughout the last year, and its important that we continue to spread the message about what help is available to those who need it most.” Matt Blanks, a project manager at Peer Aid, a scheme that helps people who are addicted to gambling, began betting aged 11. He lost more than £700,000 and tried to take his own life. He said being able to block himself from all online operators at once had been a lifesaver. “It gives you that moment’s pause, that bit of breathing space, to ensure that when you have an urge or impulse, you can’t place a bet in that moment,” he said. “That time to reflect can make all the difference.”  People with a gambling disorder are disproportionately likely to be male, but Gamstop has recorded an increasing number of women registering during lockdown. The figures come after evidence gathering for the government’s gambling review ended last week. In its submission, Gamstopsaid there had been a rise in the number of websites publishing links to black market betting operations that are not signed up to the blocking service. Membership of the scheme is a condition of being licensed to offer gambling legally in Great Britain."},{"url":null,"title":"boat race oxford cambridge men women","story":"This was always going to be difficult to predict after the pandemic saw last year’s races cancelled. For the first time since 1845 the Boat Race was taking place away from the historic course on the Thames, relocated to the Great Ouse in Ely, Cambridgeshire because of the pandemic and the closure of Hammersmith Bridge. Equally the preparation has been like no other, with Covid restrictions mandating training on rowing machines in college bedrooms and at home. The course, too, was a far cry from London but a home fixture for Cambridge, with Ely the location of the Cambridge University Boat Club boat house and where they know the water well. At 4.89km the course was shorter than usual. Running from Ely to Littleport and almost straight, it negated the traditional strategic considerations that come with twists and turns and the changing conditions on the tideway of Thames. For the women in their 75th Boat Race it was Cambridge who came together as a unit to greater effect, extending their lead over Oxford to 45-30 with a fourth straight win. They had to work for it in a race far from the five-length rout they had dealt out in 2019. However, stripped of the cacophonous barrage of encouragement from the banks, the atmospheric tension of a tightly fought battle in both races was greatly diminished. Cambridge’s president, Sophie Paine, acknowledged how hard they had been pushed. “Kudos to all of our team and to Oxford as well for a really incredible race,” she said. “I think this is absolutely historic for women. So many of us have been training for this for two years now, and it means so much for us to have that payoff. It’s really, really rewarding, I’m just so proud.” Cambridge had won the toss and chose the railway side of the Ouse, which enjoyed slightly more shelter from the light wind blowing largely across the river and a marginal advantage on the one tiny bend in the course at the 2km mark.  Immediately into a relaxed, powerful rhythm they nosed just in front at the 500m point. Yet there was no capitulation from the dark blues. Oxford found their pace, drew level and they in turn took the lead by a nose at the 1500m mark. It was a gripping encounter, with the Oxford cox, Costi Levy, being repeatedly warned by the umpire for not giving space to their rivals. Cambridge, however, did not panic and also came back, regaining their lead just past the halfway point, but the two crews’ stroke rates were almost identical. The final third decided it as Cambridge put their bow clear and while Oxford stayed in touch a tenacious effort could not make up the narrow deficit. The victors took the line by almost a length in 16min 29sec for the closest finish since 2011. For the men, in their 166th meeting, Cambridge extended their lead over Oxford to 84-81. It is the light blues’ third in a row, their first hat-trick since their dominance between 1993 and 1999. It was the closest finish since 2003, while history was made in it being umpired by a woman for the first time, the 2004 Olympic bronze medallist Sarah Winckless. Cambridge had been considered underdogs going in but launched from the start with the intent of stamping their authority on the race and it paid off. Oxford were dogged but could not overhaul their rivals again and were ultimately left exhausted and heartbroken having given their all. Cambridge’s rate was high and their rhythm impressive as they opened up almost a full a length within the first 500m. It was a dispiriting sight but their rivals fought on, steadfastly refusing to concede clear water. They, too, fought back, narrowing to within half a length, and with 3km down there was only a quarter of a length in it with both crews still well in the fight.

The report, dated 17 December, was prepared by staff working for Zühlke Engineering, a Swiss-based consultancy that has worked closely on the UK’s Covid contact-tracing app, and has a number of staff embedded within the test-and-trace team. It details research into possible public attitudes to a Covid certificate, sometimes called a domestic Covid passport. This would use vaccination status, a recent negative Covid test or proof of coronavirus antibodies to allow people into potentially packed places when the country opens up. The document includes mock-up pictures of how an app-based Covid certificate might work, using scannable QR codes. One shows this on the main NHS app, with a countdown showing when the pass expires. Another shows the certificate attached to the NHS test and trace app. This option is seen as unlikely, because the test and trace app is anonymous while the certificate involves personal information. Covid certificates are enormously controversial. At least 40 Conservative backbenchers are among 70-plus MPs who announced last week that they would oppose them. There has been considerable speculation about the use of such certificates, but as recently as February the vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, said the government was “not looking at a vaccine passport for our domestic economy”. Boris Johnson is expected to announce the initial findings of a review into the subject on Monday, but not to say categorically whether or not they will be introduced. The December document uses focus group research to highlight public attitudes towards the idea. It found that people considered them potentially useful for events such as football matches and even weddings, but not for smaller family gatherings. Concerns raised included the amount of planning needed, whether test results would arrive on time and worries that people might act more recklessly if they had a certificate. Civil liberties groups have spoken out against the idea of Covid certificates. Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, said they would be “the first attempt at a segregation policy in Britain for decades”. She said: “They would exclude and disadvantage the most marginalised people in our country, iding communities without reducing risks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0489238c8c1297b999e9d4f3d2073063fc91bab9/0_78_3526_2115/master/3526.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b112a10564af77fc5614215cc3963d2","title":"spanish town summons goya home stem decline","story":"The painter, printmaker and fascinated, appalled chronicler of war, cruelty and reason’s frequent slumbers, studied in Italy and painted for the court in Madrid before dying in Bordeaux in 1828. But he was born on the other side of the Pyrenees in Fuendetodos, a small town 27 miles (44km) south of Zaragoza in the north-eastern Spanish region of Aragon. Today, Fuendetodos and the 14 other towns and villages that make up the Campo de Belchite are invoking Goya’s name and legacy as they try to cling to the map. “By using the name of Goya, who was born in this little town near Zaragoza, we’re trying to do something a little bit like what Stratford-upon-Avon has done with William Shakespeare, or what Eisenach has done with Bach, or what Figueres has done with Salvador Dalí,” says Julio Martínez Calzón, the president of Territorio Goya. “Goya has a profound human, cultural and social pull because of the circumstances in which he created his works and because of his own capacity to reach people all over the world. We want to use that to empower the towns and villages in the Belchite region.” The area’s plight is hardly unique. Last year Spain’s socialist-led government acknowledged the problem of la España vaciada – the hollowed-out Spain – by creating a ministry for what it termed “the demographic challenge”. But not many corners of la España vaciada have a cultural figure as titanic as Goya to whom they can turn. By the end of the year, Territorio Goya hopes to have two cultural projects under way to mark the 275th anniversary of the artist’s birth, and the second centenary of the Pinturas Negras (Black Paintings) that he applied to the walls of the now demolished Quinta del Sordo estate near Madrid. The first is a reconstruction of the two floors of the Quinta del Sordo, complete with full-scale images of the Black Paintings that were photographed in 1874 before being stripped out and transferred to canvas and ending up the Prado in Madrid. “We’re hoping to produce a visceral, organic impact in visitors a shock,” says Martínez Calzón. “The idea is to show them as they were.” The second initiative has involved commissioning 15 contemporary artists from Spain, France, Italy, Mexico and the US to reinterpret the Black Paintings so that one of the reworked paintings can be exhibited in each of the 15 towns and villages in the region. Eventually, Territorio Goya hopes the Quinta del Sordo installation will form part of a permanent, international centre for Goya studies in Fuendetodos. The town’s half-built museum, one of the many casualties of Spain’s most recent boom-and-bust cycle – and a relic of a time when so many places dreamed of their own Guggenheim – would make the perfect venue and already has thousands of donated artworks that could be displayed. While Martínez Calzón wants to see many more Spaniards and foreign visitors making the pilgrimage to Fuendetodos, the project is also about ensuring that Goya finally receives his dues in his home town and beyond. “The idea is to look after the person that Goya was because of what he meant to Spain and to the world,” he says. “In his paintings, there’s a drive to capture the conceptual essence of what it means to be human and of what human society is. Before then, it was all kind of photographic and you didn’t get those incredibly intense expressions of people’s internal, unresolved passions and feelings.” The artist Ricardo Calero, one of the founder members of Territorio Goya, moved to Fuendetodos 14 years ago after undertaking a commission to reinterpret Goya’s enigmatic and incomplete Follies series. “I fell in love with the light of the place, with its rough, powerful landscape, with its skies, with its silence, and, of course, with its people,” he says. But Calero is keenly aware of the Campo de Belchite’s problems and of the urgent needs to remedy them. “Goya is a great lighthouse who could illuminate the region,” he says. “All this is about using culture as a tool for development in a really wide sense. It’s about using memory, education, nature and the landscape and raising awareness so that people can see the great value that this place and this land possess.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620b388ed670881f11df25542500ca84e21b07a4/0_241_5239_3144/master/5239.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0b5a5b793bf942bad4ba34d0eec6282","title":"uk covid traffic light travel plan too simplistic say scientists","story":"Among the plans under consideration by the government to allow more travel as restrictions ease is a traffic light system, whereby countries are given a green, amber or red designation based on factors including case rates, levels of Covid variants and the status of the country’s vaccination programme. It has been mooted that no restrictions would be placed on those entering the UK from a green country, while quarantine at home would be necessary for people entering from amber countries, and those entering the UK from red countries would face a 10-day period of hotel quarantine. However, the plans have raised concerns among some scientists. “The point about it is that any traffic light system will of course be used for people to go on holiday,” said Gabriel Scally, visiting professor of public health at the University of Bristol and a member of the Independent Sage committee. The problem, he said, was that holiday resorts attracted tourists from many different countries. “It is not quite as simple as looking at what the situation is in an inidual country from which a flight originated,” he said. “We know people will mix together from all over the world, and this is what spurred the autumn surges of cases.” Prof Rowland Kao, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh who contributes to the Spi-M modelling subgroup of Sage, agreed that restricting travel to a few locations risks turning them into locations where super spreading events are common. “Lots of people meeting together in close quarters, where social pressures mean physical distancing is less likely, means many transmission events can occur,” he said.  While international travel cannot be paused for ever, Scally said all those arriving in the UK should enter hotel quarantine. “That high level of cases is happening on our doorstep,” he said. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, agreed a traffic light approach had problems. “A traffic light system is likely to be reactive to any changes in incidence, plus any new variants of concern. As we have seen repeatedly over the last 12 months, once a problem is clear on the graph, you’re quite literally behind the curve in terms of actions required to bring case numbers down,” he said. “A proactive approach around border control would be of more help in reducing new cases. This would then limit the importation of new variants.” A concern is that overseas travel could introduce Covid variants that were not yet common in the UK, including those that may evade, at least to some degree, the immune response induced by vaccines. The concern is augmented by worries that, as restrictions in the UK are relaxed, Covid will have a greater opportunity to spread. Prof Robin Shattock, Covid-19 vaccine lead at Imperial College London, is among those who have warned that a traffic light system could be “leaky” to Covid variants. “There are always possibilities of getting around that type of system. It might be a way of starting to release some travel, but it will need to be monitored very carefully,” he told PA. Professor David Heymann, the chair of the WHO’s strategic and technical advisory group for infectious hazards, told the  many countries are having to make difficult decisions about international travel, weighing up factors such as incidence of infection and vaccination coverage. “When countries pilot an idea such as red, amber and green they will hopefully have a monitoring system in place that will permit them to assess the measures since there are no best practices guidelines that exist at present for this infection,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620b388ed670881f11df25542500ca84e21b07a4/0_241_5239_3144/master/5239.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0b5a5b793bf942bad4ba34d0eec6282","title":"vaccine passport wont be required england covid safe pilot organiser say","story":"The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced on Sunday that a series of mass gatherings and indoor events planned in April and May would take part in a trial to assess how venues might operate safely this summer. It said “Covid status certification” would be trialled as part of the programme.However, organisers of five of the nine events listed as part of the pilot programme said they would not require people to show certificates, with one saying they had received abuse since the announcement. The introduction of Covid identity documents has been opposed by civil liberties groups and more than 70 MPs, including 40 Tory backbenchers. A spokesperson for Liverpool city council – which is organising a comedy gig, an outdoor cinema, a business conference and a club night as part of the pilot – said the government briefing was incorrect, while a spokesperson for the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield also said the event would require testing for fans but not so-called vaccine passports. DCMS confirmed that the initial venues announced would only require audience members to have a negative test to secure entry but that a certification scheme was being discussed for use at later events, such as the FA Cup semi-final. The system would use vaccination status, a recent negative Covid test result or “natural immunity”, meaning a person has tested positive in the previous six months. Paul Blair, a co-owner of the Liverpool-based Hot Water Comedy Club, said it had faced a backlash after several Sunday newspapers reported that it would be involved in the certificate trials. Blair, who is organising a comedy night planned for the 16 April, said the club was not and would never be part of the programme. He said the venue had received abuse on social media and emails from people accusing it of being part of a “medical apartheid” and saying they hoped the venues owners’ would “catch Covid and die”. The comedy promoter said he was excited to be part of the pilot scheme, which he hoped would show that indoor events could be safe, but he was surprised to see headlines linking the events trial to vaccine passports. “I’m trying to put out fires, even though we didn’t start them,” he said. A spokesperson for Liverpool city council, which trialled mass community testing for people without symptoms in November, said on Sunday: “The line which was briefed out yesterday by the government about Liverpool’s events being included in the vaccine passports trials is incorrect – none of our events in Liverpool will involve them.” The pilots will explore how different approaches to social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols could ease opening and maximise participation, including the use of lateral flow tests – but there will be no use of so-called vaccine passports, the spokesperson said. Prof Iain Buchan, the executive dean at the Institute of Population Health at the University of Liverpool, who is assisting with the scheme, said that “none of the advanced research programme is using vaccination status at all”. He said the pilot in the city was focused on researching transmission at events in the hope of reducing it to “an infinitesimally small risk”, and vaccination status was not a sound evidence base. A DCMS press release that listed the events planned as part of the events research programme, with audiences of up to 1,000 people in indoor venues and 21,000 seated outdoors, had said that “Covid-status certification will be trialled as part of the pilot programme”. It is understood that plans for the scheme are still in discussion. Boris Johnson is expected on Monday to set out further details of the plans to enable the safe return of mass gatherings and indoor events as lockdown restrictions ease in England."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4528504.1617550642!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"number of irish exemptions given to students drops under new rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUnder the new system, students in special schools or classes are automatically exempt. Photograph: Getty Fewer secondary school students are securing exemptions for learning Irish since new rules were introduced two years ago.The system of opt-outs was overhauled following a Department of Education review which found it was no longer fit for purpose. It found there was a wide variety of different practices among schools which had the authority to grant Irish exemptions, with an increasing number of pupils securing opt-outs on the basis of “stress or anxiety”.Under the new system, Irish remains compulsory in school and opt-outs are available in “exceptional circumstances” for pupils from abroad or with learning difficulties.Latest figures show there was an 11 per cent drop in exemptions awarded to students since the revised rules were introduced, down from 11,717 to 10,439 over the past two years. This is against a backdrop of rising enrolments at second level.The body representing school principals said the fall in numbers was likely due to greater clarity over who is eligible for an exemption.“Under the old rules, there was a sense that principals had more discretion over providing exemptions,” said Clive Byrne of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals.“The guidelines laid down are now very clear and require documentary evidence to support exemptions.” Psychologists’ reportsAnother key reason behind the changes was a concern that psychologists’ reports and outdated rules based on IQ levels were being used to determine whether students with learning difficulties should receive exemptions.Under the new system, students in special schools or classes are automatically exempt and pupils no longer need psychological assessments to secure an exemption from studying Irish.Standardised tests are now the main method to determine if students are eligible for opt-outs and these students are required to show documentary evidence that the problems have been persistent over time.Students with learning difficulties must show, for example, that their standardised score for reading, comprehension or spelling is at or below that of the bottom 10 per cent of students in mainstream schools.The rules for students from abroad state that they are entitled to exemptions if their primary education was received outside the State up to the age of 11-12, or if they spent three years abroad after the age of 11.Latest figures show there has been an increase in the number of students with learning difficulties securing exemptions, but a decline in the students from abroad securing exemptions.For example, the number of exemptions under the category of learning disabilities has increased from 5,075 to 6,250 between 2018-2019 and 2020-2021, while the numbers from abroad are down from 5,373 to 4,193.The new system also includes an appeals procedure for those who feel they were unfairly denied an exemption.Latest figures show that of the 141 appeals to date, the vast majority – 118 – of decisions have been upheld.‘Fairer system’The Dyslexia Association of Ireland said it welcomed the overall changes which had created a fairer system. “The old system for Irish exemptions was not fit for purpose,” said the association’s chief executive, Rosie Bissett. “The new criteria is in the best interest of children with learning disabilities. It has removed unfair barriers around children’s IQ and it is more in line with what we know now about learning disabilities. The removal of the need for a psychologist’s report is also positive and it means there is no economic barrier any more.” Some in the Irish language community have opposed the measures, with groups warning the rules were a “back door” to making Irish an optional subject in the future.They argued that automatic exemptions for special needs pupils sent out a “problematic message” that Irish-medium education was not suitable for students with special educational needs."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"As the Swedish environmental activist turns 18, what next for her \u0026lsquowe children\u0026rsquo message?Demand for wood is three times higher than the country\u0026rsquos potential sustainable supplyWe have shown we can respond to the science if we accept there is an emergency"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Celtic Mist, donated by the Haughey family, now serving as a research vessel for conservation body"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.

Some\u0026nbsp28,545 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4528554.1617554728!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hazel chu highest profile candidate of seven in seanad byelection","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu, running as an Independent.

He served as Seanad spokesman on finance and vice-chair of the Oireachtas committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. A consistent contributor in the Upper House he regularly stood in as cathaoirleach, but he lost his seat in last year’s Seanad general election. This time around Fianna Fáil selected him as candidate from 12 applicants through a vote of the parliamentary party. He topped the poll and held on to win on the ninth count.Then taoiseach Enda Kenny nominated Billy Lawless to the Seanad in 2016 as a campaigner for Irish immigrant rights in the United States and he did not contest the 2020 election when his term was up.The Galway native ran a chain of bar-restaurants in Chicago, now operated by his children, and has been in Ireland full-time since last May. With the backing of a number of Independents, he has said he is “uniquely placed to speak up for the sector, its thousands of businesses and employees and its importance to Ireland as a global brand”. He also has “unfinished business” in securing similar access for Irish emigrants that Australians have to the US E3 working permits scheme which provides visas based on a “a specialty occupation” and securing the promised referendum to allow Irish citizens abroad vote in presidential elections.Ciarán Ahern, LabourFrom Rathfarnham in Dublin, Ciarán Ahern had his first political electoral outing in last year’s general election when he ran as Labour’s candidate in Dublin South-West. An employment lawyer, he is also legal adviser to Justice for Magdalenes Research and other non-governmental organisations, honorary treasurer of the Employment Law Association of Ireland, active in the Dublin Cycling Campaign and a founding director of Calcutta Connect, a charity supporting education in underprivileged communities in India.Elected to Limerick City Council in 1999, Maria Byrne served as a councillor until 2016, including a year as lord mayor from 2010-11.A 2018 Seanad byelection winner, Ian Marshall, a unionist and former president of the Ulster Farmers’ Union has Sinn Féin support as well as that of a number of Independent Senators. The business development manager at the Institution for Global Food Security in Queen’s University failed in his 2020 re-election bid. If there is a breakdown in Government parties’ discipline Marshall could be a beneficiary. Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic has, he said, meant that “building bridges, working across all communities, opening doors and opening minds, north, south, east and west, has never been more important to deal with issues on an ongoing basis”.Angela Feeney, LabourAngela Feeney is a Maynooth, Co Kildare councillor.

Photograph:  EPAFilippo MontefortePope Francis has urged countries in his Easter message to speed up the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, particularly to the world’s poor, and called armed conflict and military spending during a pandemic “scandalous”.Coronavirus has meant this has been the second year that Easter papal services have been attended by small gatherings at a secondary altar of St Peter’s Basilica, instead of crowds in the church or in the square outside.After saying Mass, Pope Francis read his Urbi et Orbi, “to the city and the world” message, in which he traditionally reviews global problems and appeals for peace.“The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nonetheless, and this is scandalous, armed conflicts have not ended and military arsenals are being strengthened,” he said.The pope, who would normally have given the address to as many as 100,000 people in St Peter’s Square, spoke to fewer than 200 in the church, while the message was broadcast to tens of millions around the world.The pope asked God to comfort the sick, those who had lost loved ones and the unemployed, urging authorities to give families in greatest need a “decent sustenance”.He praised medical workers, sympathised with young people unable to attend school, and said everyone was called on to combat the pandemic.“I urge the entire international community, in a spirit of global responsibility, to commit to overcoming delays in the distribution of vaccines and to facilitate their distribution, especially in the poorest countries.” Pope Francis, who has often called for disarmament and a total ban on the possession of nuclear weapons, said: “There are still too many wars and too much violence in the world. May the Lord, who is our peace, help us to overcome the mindset of war.”Noting it was International Awareness Day against anti-personnel landmines, he called the weapons “insidious and horrible devices...how much better our world would be without these instruments of death”. PeacefullyHe singled out for praise “the young people of Myanmar committed to supporting democracy and making their voices heard peacefully”. More than 550 protesters have been killed since the country’s military coup on February 1st. The pope visited Myanmar in 2017.The pope called for peace in several conflict areas in Africa, including the Tigray region in Ethiopia and Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique. He said the crisis in Yemen has been “met with a deafening and scandalous silence”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4528474.1617547861!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"greta thunberg it just spiralled out of control","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMural of  Greta Thunberg by artist Emmalene Blake in Smithfield, Dublin. Photograph: Laura Hutton Greta Thunberg turned 18 a few months ago but occasionally she forgets that. “I actually can vote now,” she grins. But the words “we children” still sometimes slip into her sentences, out of habit. She is sanguine about the change, but it is a bigger shift than she lets on: that phrase has been a core part of her message.Thunberg became the world’s most celebrated climate activist on the back of this idea: that children have to wake the world up to the reality of climate change. She was just 15 when she started the “school strike for climate”, for which she skipped classes and sat outside the Swedish parliament – at first alone and later with dozens, then hundreds of others every Friday.As the movement grew, aided by Thunberg’s speeches, millions of students joined in. She took a year off school, led protests all over the world and has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times.But today, the world is very different. When we speak in mid-March, most of Europe is under some form of lockdown. Thunberg is at her family home in Stockholm – her dad’s exercise bike and some houseplants form the backdrop of our Zoom call. She’s also back at school, and isn’t cutting classes on Fridays any more: protests during the pandemic have been mostly virtual.Searching for an upside to the current situation, I ask whether she sees any silver linings from the crisis, which caused global emissions to drop by 6 per cent last year.“The corona pandemic brought nothing positive,” she says bluntly. “The emissions reductions we could see were temporary and accidental ... They didn’t occur due to us actually trying to reduce emissions. So this has got nothing to do with climate action.” But the pandemic does contain a lesson, she says: “It proves that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis. It just puts it in a different light.”Thunberg became the face of the climate movement when it was enjoying a great deal of success. In the past two years, dozens of countries have announced targets of “net zero” emissions by 2050, which would mean virtually stripping fossil fuels from their economies.China and the US, the world’s two largest emitters, have both made climate change a diplomatic priority. Many of the world’s dirtiest companies have pledged to cut emissions. And images of thousands of children marching through streets in protests inspired by Thunberg have galvanised a political focus on climate change that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.“The Greta Effect” has become a phenomenon with a life of its own. It has also become the subject of study and debate, not all uncritical, by activists, academics and executives. They are asking how much of Thunberg’s impact is personal and how much is due to timing where she goes next and how long-lasting, in slow-changing economies and industries, her impact will prove to be. And these are questions that Thunberg is also asking herself.The last time we met was two years ago, when we had lunch together in Stockholm. Although Thunberg is outwardly similar, over the course of our conversation it becomes clear how much she has grown up. She is much more confident and relaxed, and gives long and complicated answers when it comes to her favourite topics, such as the pitfalls of net-zero targets.But after a slightly prickly start we settle in. Thunberg begins to work on some embroidery as she talks – a piece she has designed for a friend who is a climate activist in the Netherlands. “I can do these things during online classes,” she explains, as a red thread slides across the video screen. “I concentrate better when I do something at the same time.”I ask how her message has evolved in the past few years. Thunberg has long avoided detailed discussion of what the solutions for climate change might be – she insists that is for other people to figure out. But is it time to start thinking more about the solutions now?“If I would start talking about, like, taxes, or things like that, since I have such a big reach, that would send a signal that the climate crisis is an issue that can come down to party politics. And that really minimises this crisis,” she says.“We need to stop focusing on dates and numbers and actually accept and acknowledge the fact that we need to reduce our emissions right now. We can talk about 2030 or 2040 as much as we want. But it is what we are doing now that really matters.”The Paris Agreement of December 2015 prompted countries to gradually set more ambitious targets, and the rise of social media meant that a new type of protest movement could spread among a younger generation. But there was also something special about Thunberg herself.In one of her most famous moments on stage, she addressed the UN Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019. “How dare you?” she asked the audience of assembled grandees, with what looked like tears of rage in her eyes. “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.” Thunberg’s speech went viral, dominating headlines about the summit.Did she really feel that angry or was she putting on a bit of a show?“Well, I mean – both,” she says. “I knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so I better make the most out of it. So I allowed myself to let the emotions take over.”She seems bemused, though, that the popular image of her as an angry teenager has persisted. “I never get angry,” she says with a small chuckle. “If you ask anyone who is in my close environment, they would probably laugh at that statement.”Online, Thunberg’s wry humour comes through in her tweets, and she has taken down her critics, including former US president Donald Trump, who accused her of having an “anger management problem” in 2019 and told her to go and see a film to relax.After the US election she turned his own words against him: “Donald must work on his Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Donald, chill!” Her sense of humour seems to be thriving under lockdown.Other young activists inspired by Thunberg say that her voice was one they identified with. “What she did was just monumental, it really kickstarted the youth movement,” says Dominique Palmer, a British student and climate justice activist who joined the Fridays for Future demonstrations. “In the speeches that she gives, she says everything very clear-cut and exactly like it is. That was very refreshing for a lot of people.”Sabherwal’s paper found that people who had heard of Thunberg were likely to feel a stronger sense of “collective efficacy”, the belief that they could make a difference by acting together. The sample size was small – about 1,300 US adults – but Sabherwal thinks the effect may be even more pronounced in young people, who were not included in the survey.The surge of youth activism has already had some real-world impacts, including court cases over climate change brought by children. A recent legal challenge in Australia seeks to stop fossil-fuel extraction in the country on the grounds that the government is violating its “duty of care” to protect young people from climate change. (A similar case in the US was dismissed last year.)In the corporate world, too, Thunberg’s name has been ubiquitous. “A year ago, I could not have gone into a boardroom without someone referring to her, to Greta specifically, or to the movement,” says Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. “Greta and her movement have played an incredibly important role in raising awareness.”A search through transcripts of corporate presentations shows that Thunberg’s name pops up in unlikely places. The chief executive of Deutsche Börse, the German stock exchange group, cited her when introducing its work on sustainable finance. The head of a large uranium mining company pointed to Thunberg when giving his prognosis for the future of the nuclear industry. A tractor manufacturer referred to her as it outlined its plans for low-emissions farm vehicles. The list goes on.“She is a presence – sometimes explicit, always implicit – in the debates that are taking place, about the societal concern over climate change and the need for companies to be seen as good actors,” says Mark Lewis, chief sustainability strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management.Some think Thunberg gets a bit too much credit. Mike Hulme, a professor of human geography at Cambridge university, likens Thunberg to the polar bear as the latest climate icon. “Fifteen years ago, wherever you looked, the polar bear popped up ... And for a period, wherever you looked, Greta Thunberg seemed to be on stage.”But Kingsmill Bond, energy strategist at Carbon Tracker, a climate change think tank, says: “The big thing that is different now to any other time in the last 50 years, in attempts to take climate more seriously, is that the economics now work. And that is the big shift that has happened. So instead of pushing water uphill, we are now pushing water downhill.”In many parts of the world, renewable energy is now cheaper than its fossil fuel equivalent. The cost of solar panels has fallen more than 80 per cent over the past decade, while the cost of batteries is one-seventh of what it was 10 years ago. The affordability of renewable energy has in turn prompted many governments to promise to cut their emissions by one count, around two-thirds of the global economy is covered by some form of zero emissions pledge.“She seized the moment,” Bond says. “It could have taken a very long time. You could say the same about any leader – that change would have happened regardless – but you do actually need people to do it.”One thing she is grateful for is that she can still go about her daily life in Stockholm undisturbed. “I’m very lucky in Sweden, we have this thing called jantelagen ... no one comes up to you,” she says. “If I go to another country, even if it’s just Denmark or Norway. then I can’t walk down the street without people stopping me. But here in Sweden no one even looks at me. I can see in their eyes that they know it’s me, and that they recognise me, but they don’t stop me. Which is quite nice, actually.”She is unsure what the next steps will be for the climate youth movement. “We have learnt during this last year that nothing can be taken for granted, that we can’t plan things in advance.”Even though she is not a child any longer, she says her primary tool has not changed – using the moral high ground to ask the adults to do the right thing. “People say that we shouldn’t be using morals, or like, shaming people, or using guilt or whatever. But since we don’t have any globally binding agreements, that’s all we have ... It’s the only resource we have available at hand.”In many ways Thunberg’s platform shows the great power that protest can have – but also its limitations. Making demands can go a long way. But the child activists will grow up. And the next steps in the climate movement are likely to fall to scientists, policymakers or engineers.With the UN climate summit, COP26, coming up later this year in Glasgow, I ask if she thinks it can make a difference.Thunberg has attended several recent climate summits, first as a little-known activist in Katowice, Poland, in 2018, and the following year as a celebrity in Madrid and New York. She says she will probably go to Glasgow, “if it doesn’t get cancelled again, and if I get invited”.But she thinks the previous summits all failed – and Glasgow won’t be any different. “We can hold these conferences and meetings for eternity, over and over again, as many as we want. That still won’t lead to any change. Unless we ... actually start acknowledging this crisis and admit that we have failed thus far.”Her dogs, Roxy and Moses, are barking at the door, and her embroidery has paused. I ask if she knows what is next and whether she thinks she’ll keep working in the field of climate change.“Unfortunately, yes,” she tells me. “The wish would be that everything would just be all right. And that there wouldn’t be a need for climate activists. But to be realistic, that’s probably not going to be the case. One thing is for sure, we are still going to do everything we can, based on the circumstances. And continue to communicate the science, and to be a pain in the ass for people in power,” she says with a little laugh. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4528545.1617554375!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd sad and beautiful book by hunter biden","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Hunter Biden: Page after page, you wonder: How the hell is this guy still alive? Photograph: Win McNameePool Photo via AP, File)A Twitter wag summed it up best: “Matt Gaetz is everything the Republicans were looking for in Hunter Biden. ”The New York Times’s report about a federal investigation into whether the Florida congressman had a sexual relationship with a minor and paid for her to travel has set off a scandal worthy of a pulp paperback, one swirling with claims of extortion, ecstasy, an orgy, a hula hoop and sex trafficking, along with an Iranian hostage and, of course, a cameo by Roger Stone. We are awash in sordid tales of Gaetz – the Beavis to Donald Trump’s Butt-Head – creating a points system for sexual conquests and showing nude photos of women to other (often appalled) lawmakers on the House floor.The moment crystallises Republican hypocrisy. Trump and Gaetz viciously beat up on Hunter Biden, undeterred by their own vices.As it happens, Hunter begins his new memoir, Beautiful Things, with a scene of him watching Gaetz on TV reading a magazine excerpt about Hunter’s addiction into the record of the House Judiciary Committee’s hearing during Trump’s first impeachment.Biden writes: “‘I don’t want to make light of anybody’s substance abuse issues . . .’ Gaetz said, snickering for the cameras as he made light of my substance abuse issues.“‘Again, I’m not . . . casting any judgment on any challenges someone goes through in their personal life,’ Gaetz continued, as he cast judgment on my personal life . . . Trump believed that if he could destroy me, and by extension my father, he could dispatch any candidate of decency from either party – all while erting attention from his own corrupt behaviour. Where’s Hunter?“I’m right here. I’ve faced and survived worse . . . I’m not going anywhere. I’m not a curio or sideshow to a moment in history, as all the cartoonish attacks try to paint me. I’m not Billy Carter or Roger Clinton, God bless them. I am not Eric Trump or Donald Trump jnr.”Self-destructive behaviourYes, for all his messy, self-destructive behaviour, this Hunter has never slaughtered and posed with wild animals or whipped up a crowd for an insurrection.For years, Joe Biden’s second son has been a tabloid buffet of strippers, leaked photos, crack pipes, family love triangles, an incriminating laptop, a stray gun and ethical quandaries.When the book was announced two months ago, it seemed like another bad calculation by Hunter, sure to overshadow his father’s presidential honeymoon.But it isn’t. The book, ineffably sad and beautifully written, tears the tabloid face off the story about an American family that has experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. The outline is familiar but the details are wrenching, proving that drugs can drag anyone down, even a famous politician’s privileged son who drove into inner cities to buy crack in his Porsche and who had plenty of Burisma “funny money” as he called it, to rehab-hop. Even his father, chasing him down a driveway after a family intervention, could not overcome “crack’s dark power”.Page after page, you wonder: How the hell is this guy still alive?At 51, Hunter has not lost his knack for getting tangled up in messes. He offered a disingenuous reply in a CBS interview airing on Sunday about the notorious laptop he supposedly forgot to pick up from a Delaware repair shop: “There could be a laptop out there that was stolen from me. It could be that I was hacked. It could be that it was the – that it was Russian intelligence.” No one is buying that.The book recounts a litany of other times he left incriminating evidence in rental cars, got ripped off in drug deals or had his Gucci loafers, $800 sports coat and Rimowa luggage stolen by the “scummy subculture” he was hanging with in Hollywood hotels.And while he writes that he would not go on the Burisma board if he had to do it over again, because it allowed Trump to target him and his dad, he doesn’t acknowledge that his Ukraine and China dealings were super swampy.‘Non-stop depravity’Still, the book illuminates the underworld of addiction – our national shame – that left the son of a vice-president and presidential candidate sharing an apartment with his crack connection in the shadow of the White House sweating, crying, chanting the Hail Mary, dropping off the grid to live in a $59-a-night Super 8 motel off I-95, and getting blacklisted by one Hollywood hotel after another because of his “travelling band of vampires” straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie, “an opaque, sinister night world of interconnected lives that roamed LA between 2am and 8am”, consisting of “thieves, junkies, petty dealers, over-the-hill strippers, con artists and assorted hangers-on”. Not to mention Samoan gangsters with wild nicknames.“It was,” he writes, “non-stop depravity.”Hunter’s odyssey to a “dark, bleak hole” tormented by the “Four Horsemen of the Crackocalypse” is a mythic saga: two brothers, Irish twins so inseparable they were referred to by a single moniker, BeauAndHunt one who takes the straight path and the other, the crooked one. It is, above all, a love story. A love letter written to his dead brother, his soul mate and protector, Beau.Even his “shared-grief oasis” romance with Hallie, Beau’s widow, is explained by Hunter as a mistaken belief “that by loving each other we somehow could love him back into existence”.‘Trauma and stress’The memoir is, in essence, a response to Beau, whose first words in the hospital, after the crash that killed their mother and baby sister when they were little, were simply: “I love you. I love you. I love you.”“I really believe that its trauma and stress contributed to my brother’s health problems,” Hunter writes of the crash. He doesn’t blame his addiction on it, but he writes that the miasma of unease afterward left him always feeling alone in a crowd.People flocked to Beau, who became known as “the sheriff” in high school he was the perfect son, husband, father, military officer and public official. He never had a drink until he was 21 and he quit at 30. Hunter had his first glass of champagne at eight, under a table at a party for his dad’s re-election to the Senate in 1978. Beau went to AA meetings with Hunter and tried to save him, again and again.“Eventually it became too much for me to even pour a drink,” writes Hunter. “I’d use a kitchen knife to remove the plastic nub that controls the pour on a handle of vodka, then drink straight from the bottle.”When Hunter es into the void in LA, learning how to cook crack in his Chateau Marmont bungalow, he still manages to write letters addressed to his late brother, telling him how much he would have loved California. “Did you know there are mountain lions and coyotes here?” he wrote Beau. “I mean RIGHT HERE? I wish we’d both learned to surf. I remember when we used to say that you, me and Dad were going to ride motorcycles up and down the Pacific Coast Highway. I regret we never did.

In our rural benefice, all churches are open and our Rector will be running against the clock to hold services in each of the six he serves, beginning with a 6.15am outdoor ‘sunrise service’ and ending with 6pm evensong.Like an Olympian, he will carry a candle flame – symbolising the light of the resurrected Christ – taken from the bonfire at last night’s Easter Vigil and strapped, in a large lantern, into the passenger seat as he drives between villages, trying not to put it out, set fire to his car or collide with a tractor.Trying to keep the flame of Christianity alive in parishes is a Herculean task at the best of times. Last Easter, with churches closed and services cancelled, the pandemic forced our Rector to juggle online worship with dodgy rural broadband, setting up WhatsApp support groups and providing urgent help to the sick, lonely, bereaved, frightened and elderly.He celebrated last year’s sunrise service alone, maintaining the rural tradition of outdoor services. Normally, the flame would have been taken into church and shared. Instead, he took it home and maintained it religiously until the churches reopened, some 24 weeks later – burning through a large quantity of candles, fortunately without burning down his vicarage.“In my mind I was the torchbearer for our community, keeping that spiritual essence alight,” he reflects. “The door was locked, yet ‘the church’ was not dead but very much alive.”This Easter, many churches have decided to remain closed and many shielders are staying at home so online services must continue – perpetuating the vicar’s role as media star, director of broadcasting and IT consultant for those watching on Zoom or YouTube.  Pity vicars like mine, who are also wrestling the burdens of central safety diktats in order to restore physical worship, while running a booking system to manage attendance numbers. People can bring their dogs to the sunrise service – cue risk assessment concerns about dogfights. Small choirs are allowed indoors, but congregations can only sing outdoors. The socially distanced Easter Egg hunt is a miracle of strategic planning. Meanwhile, the usual jolly breakfast is cancelled and he will have no fuel injection of coffee and Simnel cake to keep him going.  No one is queuing up for these multi-parish country vicar jobs – yet I hear of clergy being pressurised, some to retire early, others to take on extra parishes. My parents attend a London church where five clergy take the same service. Who knows how this makes sense, with the Church’s policy of cutting clergy costs in rural areas, and expecting untrained lay, often retired, volunteers to do the job instead.Nevertheless, our middle-aged Rector has thrown himself into Easter preparations with touching enthusiasm. As a curate, he rashly lit an Easter fire in hay bales which became an inferno, singeing an eyebrow and the hair on his arms. Now, he is countrified enough to have welded his own fire pit. He is looking forward to seeing his congregations back in their own village churches, knowing those beloved spaces exert a particular pull.  “Here in the country”, he says, “there is a strong sense of place and who we are, a love of the church building and the landscape.” As Reverend Andrew Davison, in his book Parish: An Anglican Theology of Place, writes: “For better and for worse, English place is steeped in Christianity… our sense of wonder that, in Kenneth Clark’s words, ‘we are surrounded by things which we have not made’”.  In his 1893 poem The Country Faith, Norman Gale claims that country faith is “the best of all”. Perhaps it is not the best expression of the sacred mysteries, more a middle-of-the-road jumble of traditions, bound by mud and goodwill. Yet its strength is being united in a spirit of providing something for everyone – Anglo-Catholics and Evangelicals, old and young, rich and poor – because in a small place you simply need bums on seats.Traditionally in England, physical and spiritual needs have been dealt with at local level, by GP and parish priest. The last year demonstrated the continuing benefit of the local system. Richard Chartres, the former Bishop of London, observed in his Lenten Reflections that machines may be able to think for us, but cannot love. There are plenty of online religious influencers, but few rural local leaders, of working age, committed to feeding the hungry and trying to assuage despair. An Easter edition of Countryfile, on BBC1 at 6pm today, examines how rural parish churches are struggling with falling donations and mounting costs.  Father Daniel Horan, in his article ‘Death penalty, pandemic’, writes of Easter’s role in “holy mourning and hope”. I find myself feeling that society needs more of us to be ‘doers’ and to emulate my Rector in serving others joyfully. As we emerge from a slow year and start heading out again, we need to remember neighbours who may be trampled in the rush.Charity begins at home, then radiates out in a series of concentric circles. The Church of England offers a structure through which unegotistical good can be done, as long as we have a priest in every parish, to care for every soul.

God bless and keep them safe,” tweeted Hamzah’s American born mother, Queen Noor, on Sunday morning. While the Jordanian government denied that Hamzah had been arrested, a video shared with the BBC by his lawyer showed the prince saying he is “not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them, because in the meetings that I had been present in — or on social media relating to visits that I had made — there had been criticism of the government or the king.”At a press conference on Sunday, Ayman Al Safadi, the Jordanian deputy prime minister, said that Prince Hamzah had been communicating with foreign entities and associates inside Jordan in a long-term plan to destabilise the country.Bassem Awadallah, a former chief of the royal court, Sharif Hassan Ben Zaid, a royal family member, and 14 other unnamed figures have been detained, he said. The deputy prime minister said Mr Awadallah, who has business ties in several Gulf states, was planning on leaving the country and was trying to secure a plane for Prince Hamzah’s wife to leave. Mr Sadafi said efforts had been made to contain the situation within the family but steps had to be taken when the suspects moved past the planning stage and began to discuss when they would carry it out. Authorities then stepped in to cut communications between Prince Hamzah and the foreign parties.“I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, for the corruption, and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years, and has been getting worse by the year,” Prince Hamzah said in the video. While there have been no public quarrels, relations between Hazmah and his half brother King Abdullah II are thought to have been strained since the former was stripped of his title as Crown Prince in 2004. Abdullah came to the throne in 1999 when their father, King Al Hussein bin Talal, died of cancer. The new king named Hamzah, who was believed to have been the favourite of Hussein’s 11 children, the Crown Prince, making him next in line. But Hamzah was stripped of his title just five years later and pushed into the political abyss when Adbullah gave the role to his eldest son, 26-year-old Al Hussein bin Abdullah II. The schism in the royal family that was laid bare in Saturday night’s unprecedented events has been brewing for some time, according to Lina Khatib, MENA director at Chatham House.“Some members of the royal family have been trying to instrumentalise Jordan’s economic and governance problems to present themselves as reformists who possess the solution to Jordan’s challenges,” said Ms Khatib. “Their narrative seeks to undermine the King, who continues to enjoy wide support in the West.”The appearance of cracks in the royal family immediately raised concerns over Jordan’s stability in both the West and the Middle East, with world leaders quickly offering King Abdullah II their support. It remains unclear whether Prince Hamzah will face any charges or will be dealt with by the family internally.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us removes astrazeneca baltimore factory vaccine mix up","story":"AstraZeneca has been kicked out of a production plant in Baltimore after a mix-up is thought to have contaminated 15 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine produced by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.The OxfordAstraZeneca jab has yet to obtain approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, but production of the vaccine has started in anticipation of a green light.It was being produced by a sub-contractor at a plant operated by Emergent BioSolutions in Baltimore.The plant was also manufacturing Johnson \u0026amp Johnson\u0027s vaccines and workers at the factory mistakenly mixed the ingredients.As a result 15 million doses of the vaccine produced by Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, which has been given FDA approval, had to be destroyed.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson will now assume full responsibility for the production of its vaccine at the plant.The pharmaceutical giant, which has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-shot vaccine to the US by the end of May, said it will deploy additional staff at the Baltimore plant.AstraZeneca\u0027s vaccine will be produced elsewhere in the United States, the US Department of Health and Human Services said. The location has not been disclosed.AstraZeneca and the US Government continue to work closely together to support agreed-upon plans for the development, production and full delivery of the vaccine, the company said.The American decision is a fresh blow for the Anglo-Swedish company after Germany suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for the under-60s last week because of concerns over reported blood clots.Other European countries have also paused use of the vaccine in recent weeks amid safety concerns. The European medicines Agency has said the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective with the benefits outweighing the risks.Anthony Fauci, America\u0027s top infectious diseases expert, has voiced doubts that the United States would even need the AstraZeneca vaccine given the contracts which have already been signed with other manufacturers.My general feeling is that given the contractual relationships that we have with a number of companies, that we have enough vaccine to fulfill all of our needs without invoking AstraZeneca, he said last week.“If you look at the numbers (of doses) that we’re going to be getting … it is likely that we can handle any boost that we need, but I can’t say definitely for sure,” he told Reuters.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"first timebuyersare saving 800 year compared renting","story":"First-time buyers are saving more than £800 a year compared with if they were renting typically, analysis suggests.Halifax said the cost gap between being on the property ladder and renting has widened over the past year.This adds up to a difference of more than £800 over a year.Buyers in London are on average £4,606 a year better off than those renting, the research found.The slimmest gap between buying and renting is in Northern Ireland, where buyers were £539 a year typically better off than renters.First-time buyers still need to find a £58,986 deposit on average to put down, the research found.But, if they can find the deposit required to get on the property ladder, low interest rates have meant monthly mortgage payments have increased more slowly than rents, Halifax said.Andrew Asaam, mortgages director, Halifax, said the average first home deposit has gone up by £11,000 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.He added: We have also committed to lending £10 billion in 2021 to help people buy their first home this year.The review was based on the typical costs of buying or renting a three-bedroom property.Average buying costs included mortgage payments, income lost by funding a deposit rather than saving, spending on household maintenance and repairs, and insurance costs.One-off costs, such as stamp duty, valuation and legal fees were excluded.Mortgage payments were calculated based on average loans made to first-time buyers regionally, according to figures from trade association UK Finance.Average rents were calculated based on data from BM Solutions - a buy-to-let brand from the same banking group as Halifax.Here are the average monthly buying costs across the UK, followed by renting costs, according to Halifax, followed by the annual savings made by buying:More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"monday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Everyone in the country will be encouraged to take two Covid tests a week to show they are not infected, Boris Johnson will announce on Monday.The rapid lateral flow tests will be paid for by the Government and can be delivered to homes free of charge from Friday. Read the full story.MPs will be given a vote on plans for vaccine passports before they are introduced, risking a Government defeat in the Commons, The  has learnt.Michael Gove, who is leading an official review of the scheme, has privately promised MPs who are critical of vaccine checks that they will be given a chance to vote them down.

Boris Johnson said taking regular tests would be key to the continued easing of lockdown as he prepares to outline plans for the next stage of the roadmap out of lockdown today.From April , anyone will be able to access free, rapid lateral flow tests for themselves and their families to use twice a week. The Prime Minister said: “Massive efforts have been made by the British public to stop the spread of the virus. “As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our roadmap to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted.” People will be able to obtain a test through a home ordering service, workplace or school testing programme, or by collecting one at a local test site. A new pharmacy collect service is also being launched, which will provide an additional route to regular testing. Those aged over  without symptoms will be able to visit a participating local pharmacy and collect a box of seven rapid tests to use twice a week at home.  Mr Johnson is also expected to confirm the use of vaccine passports as part of plans to enable ato mass gatherings and indoor events. Covid certicates would be based on whether people have had the jab, a negative test, or can prove immunity with a recent antibody test. Work is said to be underway on producing digital proof of Covid status, such as an app, as well as a paper-based form for people without smartphones. IT firm Netcompany, which has created a digital passport app for use in Denmark next month, is said to be working on the technical architecture of a possible app for the UK. Ministers are hoping the scheme will help to reopen mass gatherings such as festivals, football matches and nightclubs. However it is not expected to be used in initial pilots this month for events like the FA Cup semi-final and the Snooker World Championship, which will focus on testing. Certicates will not be required in shops and on public transport, or in businesses due to reopen soon such as pubs and restaurants. The plan will reportedly have a year-long limit as ministers seek to head off a backlash from MPs opposed to the plan.Sports minister Nigel Huddleston has said the trials aimed to understand how to “manage and mitigate” the risks of coronavirus transmission. “It is not just about certication. The earlier pilots almost certainly won’t involve any elements of certication but it will involve testing, making sure that people are tested before and after the events,” he said. “What we will be looking at is the mitigation measures. So ventilation, one-way systems, hygiene measures, all of those kinds of things to help inform long-term decision-making.” Mr Johnson is also expected to unveil a traffic-light system for international travel, after a Government probe into how to restart foreign trips. Travellers arriving from countries rated “green” will not be required to isolate - although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed, potentially running to hundreds of pounds. Destinations classed as “amber” or “red” will mean Brits have to quarantine on , either at home or in a Government-backed hotel. Officials said it was still too early to predict which countries would be on which list and they continue to advise against booking summer holidays abroad. Professor Melinda Mills, director of the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford, said there are “still a lot of open questions” about the scheme. She told BBC Breakfast: “There’s scientic questions, there’s logistical questions - how will it work - with an app or a paper version  - and there’s real ethical questions as well, too: do I have to pay for the testingI haven’t been vaccinated or had that opportunity ”  Tory former cabinet minister David Davis described the idea as a “rather silly measure”, adding: “We are not used to presenting papers - or the electronic equivalent - to go to the pub or to go to a football match. That is not what we think of our freedoms.” Rory Boland, Editor of Which  Travel, said holidaymakers needed clarity on when they could book a getaway with confidence. He said: ”Let’s not forget that countless holidaymakers lost money last year after being caught out while trying to follow the government’s travel corridor system. “We mustn’t have a repeat of this fiasco, so we need a clear understanding of what the system will be and what the potential is for further disruption.” "},{"url":null,"title":"its mystery how bare faced","story":"NewsopinionIts a mystery how bare-faced Boris Johnson keeps getting away with everythingIf Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister gave £, of public money to a woman he’d had affair with, or had same shameful track record with UK Covid deaths, would media be so forgiving mirrorShareCommentsByMark Steel:,  APR NewsopinionJenner Arcuri with Boris Johnson\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

So someone should make one about the biggest mystery of our times – how Boris Johnson manages to sodding get away with it. ImagineJeremy Corbyn had become Prime Minister and £, of public money went to a woman he’d had sex with on his settee, while his we was away. Iain Duncan-Smith would propose in parliament that a tactical nuclear strike was carried out on the spring onion patch on his allotment. The Dailywould say: “In order to maintain that our nation upholds the rule of public decency, it is imperative that Mr Corbyn is smothered in beef fat and made to run naked through an industrial estate, strapped to the settee while chased by a pack of wild dogs, then Jacob Rees-Mogg sips sherry to the celebratory tones of a bugle to rejoice at his capture.” The head of the Civil Service would tell us Corbyn had breached the code on International Furniture Fornication, so renounced his right to be human and must now be classied as an amphibian, and made to live on a lily in the New Forest. The Chief Executive of the Settee Society would be on television every day, declaring Corbyn had offended settees deeply. Indeed he personally knew hundreds of them that were now terried to leave the DFS warehouse. The settee on which the act took place would be placed in a glass called the “Box of Evil” and people would be charged £ to queue up and see it from a distance, with signs on the wall warning no one should go too close as it was so toxic, you could catch Corbynity off it, which would make you forget to sing National Anthems and make promises to nationalise things without costing them properly. Instead, most of the British media ignored completely that the Prime Minister was accused of using his position of Mayor of London to fund the project of a woman he fancied.  Andthey had to report it, they’d probably say “Bonky Boris as randy as an Easter bunny’”and he’d go up % in the polls. In the same way, imagineCorbyn had wasted £billion on a useless Test and Trace system.

Dr Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, said it would be a mistake to water down guidance, including advice for pupils to wear masks in the classroom and other areas where social distancing is dficult. The Department for Education is conducting a review into whether to continue with the face coverings policy in the summer term. The measures, which were brought in when schools reopened in March, are not mandatory and apply in secondary schools and colleges. Dr Roach said: “There is a real risk that the success of the vaccination programme to date, the easing of the lockdown and the reduction in current case numbers could lead to ministers being tempted to relax the Covid control measures in schools after Easter. “In our view this would be a mistake. Ministers must model the behaviour they want to see in maintaining discipline and adherence to Covid safety measures. “Relaxing the rules in schools would send a message to pupils and parents that the threat of Covid has passed at a time when extreme caution is still needed. “We are not out of the woods yet and maintaining the highest levels of Covid security in our schools is critical as we move into the new term in order to protect the safety and health of teachers and learners.” A survey of , of members found % backed secondary pupils wearing face coverings in the classroom. It comes after the NASUWT joined four other major unions to write to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson to warn him against rushing into abandoning mask guidance. Robert Halfon, Tory chairman of the Commons Education Committee, said the Government needed to give an update on the scientic basis for the guidance and whether the policy had impacted on children’s learning.

Although the official figure for cases of the virus among the UK population now stands at .million, the true picture is likely to be much higher. Many may have contracted the bug before it escalated into a full-blown pandemic, and others will have carried it asymptomatically or with only very mild symptoms. There are however a few key things to look out for that can show you caught Covid over the last year, reports GloucestershireLive. Here are eight tell-tale signs that you may have suffered from the virus, and perhaps not even known that you had caught it.  Post coronavirus symptomsRed eyes The College of Optometrists said: It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred. A cough that sounds dferent We all know that a persistent dry cough is one of the key symptoms of coronavirus. But many have begun to describe a Covid cough as sounding dferent to one you may usually get. The cough is persistent, harder to combat and, for smokers, will be dferent to a usual apossmokeraposs coughapos. It is likely to last for at least half a day.  Brain fogThea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache.The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman said. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. Being hot to the touch A high temperature is considered a fever when it reaches .C . Though numbers can y for dferent people. If you feel hot to the touch, especially on your chest or back, then you are likely to have this symptom.  Out of breath If youaposre suffering with a tight chest or dficulty breathing, it may be a sign you have coronavirus. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. However, most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Sudden loss of smell or taste The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediately. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus.

Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, said: “While they may be small, these devices will make a huge dference to people who suffer from these debilitating headaches – relieving painful symptoms and allow people to go about their daily lives as normal. “The NHS Long Term Plan committed to making cutting edge treatments and technology available to save and improve lives. “This is the latest example of the NHS testing the latest tech and rolling it out at speed for patients across the country.” Cluster headaches begin quickly and are often described as a sharp, burning or piercing sensation on one side of the head. Attacks last between  minutes and three hours and occur up to eight times a day. Patients can use the device regularly to prevent cluster headaches or when they feel one starting to come on. While rare, the debilitating condition is more common in men and tend to start when they are in their s or s.

Dean Poulton and Borja De Maqua, from the Midlands, purchased the Georgian manor house in the countryside in March .The couple, who met nine years ago, had outgrown their property and were in need of somewhere bigger, reports Northants Live. So, they sold up and placed an offer on another house. But when the deal fell through, the pair were left homeless, forcing them to move in briefly with Deanaposs parents. Then they saw the estate in the countryside. The estate comprises of a Georgian manor house, a caretakeraposs cottage, the servants quarters, the stables and a gardeneraposs cottage, the oldest parts of which date back as far as the th century. With  rooms to decorate, the couple were in for a heck of a challenge, even with their previous renovation experience. Before taking on, what theyaposve named the Tiny Estate, they had completed a number of other home projects, but this was their most ambitious one to date. We never planned to do this, we certainly donapost need this much space, Borja said.  But we are romantic people. We took a look at the place and we just saw what we could do with it rather than what it looked like then. We fell in love with it. When they first moved into the property they had no heating or electricity and only a working shower.  Most of the work we did when we first got the place was just trying to get into the properties, Borja said. Dean, an architect, and Borja, a surveyor, managed to keep costs down by completing the jobs themselves. But since theyaposve been working on the estate in their spare time, itaposs been a time-consuming project.  The couple have almost completed the renovation of the caretakeraposs cottage. Next, theyaposll renovate the Servantsapos Quarters. Eventually, they hope to move into the Georgian manor and rent out other parts of the estate to bring in some money.

Luke Ash, , forced himself out of a deep depression after his closest pal, Ryan James, took his own le at the age of  in August .The devastating news threw Lukeaposs le into chaos and he admitted he just didnapost care anymore and would eat anything, reports WalesOnline.Describing himself as a big lad even before the tragedy, Luke says he started to pile on the pounds even more as his mental health spiralled downhill. The pair had just got back from a summer holiday in Barcelona together when he got a phone call dealing the heartbreaking blow. “We’d been best friends since we’d met in Year  in school,” said Luke, from Blaengarw, Bridgend. “It was just such a huge shock. We had gone on holiday to Barcelona in May of that year and it was a time of real happiness as his brother had recently got married. “That August, we had planned to go to see a Wales v England international in Cardf, so he was still making plans. It just didn’t feel real. The process of going through losing someone like that is hard at anytime but being under those circumstances just made it even worse. Luke says his instinct was to turn to food as a way of coping through the grief. “I don’t really drink or anything so food has always been my thing,” he said. “Food was my crutch. To be honest with you I just didn’t care at the time. I didn’t notice or pay any attention to what I was doing or what I was eating.” This state of mind lasted several months following Ryan James’ passing, but something changed in Luke’s world when coronavirus started spreading across the world in .He admitted that the pandemic was “a catalyst” for losing weight because of the numerous reports that obesity was a risk factor. Luke started counting calories and did intermittent fasting that would see him not consume any food for  hours a day. “I still ate things I liked because I still wanted to satisfy my sweet tooth, but I would buy low calorie things. I set myself a daily limit of , calories whereas before that I would be eating , calories plus every day, he said. Since he started his diet in May , Luke has lost  pounds in  months - thataposs just over seven stone. His appearance has been transformed as he now weighs st lbs, and still wants to lose more and get down to around the st mark.  Despite admitting he will go back to eating breakfast in the mornings again as he continues his diet he vows he “certainly won’t go back to eating and snacking late at night”. For the first time in years, Luke said he can enjoy the simple things in le - having more energy, going for walks, going for runs and sleeping better. “Ryan is always on my mind,” admitted Luke.

Earlier this week Max, from Brixton, south London managed to scoff kg of the Cadburyaposs chocolate in less than half an hour. He got the idea from other competitive eaters online and the  prison drama Cool Hand Luke, filming it all for his Youtube channel. In the Oscar-winning movie, Paul Newmanaposs character famously triumphs in a spur-of-the-moment bet that he can eat  hard-boiled eggs in an hour. Speaking of his own success, Max said the secret was to wash down the treats with warm water. He said: It’s weird because there are so many calories in them despite there not being much quantity, so you feel full but you don’t at the same time. You know you don’t want to eat anymore and have a sugar crash the next day. You want to be hungry then, because they’re not nutritious and you’re running on empty calories. I had water – it sounds weird – but warm water helped break it down a bit, but by the end, I was also drinking lots of dferent types of milk and things like that as well to mix up the flavour too.  Asked what the hardest part of the challenge was, he went on: It was definitely the shell, you’d think they’d not be too bad – I even thought that after eating one beforehand in about  seconds easily. But they’re so dense and hard, you have to really chew before you get to the centre that’s really sugary and thick. It’s basically really hard to eat chocolate fast. After about  the sugar rush hits you and while you might not necessarily feel full your body is just like “I don’t really want that.

Kylie Dixon was suffering with night sweats and itchy legs when she was pregnant with her son Jake, but when they persisted for six months after he was born she received some devastating news.Kylie, who is from Newton-le Willows, Mersyside, was told that she was suffering from an aggressive form of Hodgkin lymphoma, a rare type of blood cancer, and advised that she could have up to eight weeks to live, reported the Liverpool Echo.When she was first diagnosed in , Kylie underwent nine months of chemotherapy and was thought to be in remission, but relapsed and had to endure more chemo and a bone marrow transplant. Thankfully, after responding well to treatment, Kylie, now , is cancer-free a decade later, and she is now urging everyone to run, walk or jog k for Cancer Research UK. She said: “Going through cancer treatment is the hardest, most gruelling journey I’ve ever experienced. A lot of the symptoms I first experienced, like the itchy legs and night sweats, are common in pregnant women so everyone just assumed they were normal signs of pregnancy. “It was only much later when I developed a lump in my neck that I was sent for more urgent testing, which was six months after giving birth to my little boy. To be told at that point that I only had eight weeks to live was devastating, especially with a new baby. What should have been the happiest time of my le suddenly turned into a living nightmare.” Despite the severity of her situation, there was one big worry on Kylie’s mind when she started her chemotherapy. “One of the first questions I asked was whether I was going to lose my hair. It was such a massive part of my identity and in some ways I felt like I’d rather die than lose it.” Now she has made a full recovery, Kylie is urging everyone who notices an unusual change in their body to see their doctor. She is also encouraging people to support cancer chairties by doing some fundraising, and will be taking part in the Race For Le later this year to raise funds for Cancer Research UK.

John and Laura Lewis embarked on a mission to build the structure around a majestic tree in their land and even called an architect to make it as luxurious as possible. The treehouse is the size of a small house - about  square metres and  metres off the floor.The couple said this is the third treehouse they built together, but the whole process was much more complex and challenging than the previous times, Wales Online reports.The foundations of the treehouse are constructed from large steel frames which are built over the tree roots, with the decking, joists and floorboards added next. Then, when the treehouse had a sound base, the build team could start erecting the actual structure including the walls, upstairs floor and roof. Prince Llywelyn treehouse is an exciting structure not only for children, but also for adults. One of its most amazing features is a veranda boasting a hot tub - a dream location to stargaze. In the house there is also a luxurious brass bath. Laura said: I love the brass bath. I was adamant I wanted a aposwowapos bath for the new treehouse. I searched all over the internet searching for the perfect one. I didnapost really know what I was looking for to be honest - I just knew when I found it, and fell in love! I tend to work outwards when planning the interiors and everything in the bathroom was designed to revolve around the bath. When youaposre in it, you can also see the stream which runs underneath the treehouse. It looks like a little waterfall. Inside, the spacious house in the air can offer a sociable and super-trendy looking kitchen diner that has mesmerising views out over the coupleaposs land and beyond for many miles, to the Radnor Forset on the horizon. The main material inside the structure is wood, but some special additions include metallic accents, soft tactile textures and fabrics. One of the most surprising parts of the treehouse is the floor-suspended hammock, affectionately named by the couple as the aposonly the braveapos hammock. Laura said: We needed a treehouse large enough to accommodate a family of five and have achieved it by adding a hammock, so it can actually sleep seven with two of them on the hammock.  John added: The floor suspended hammock is a great feature. We sourced it from a company in France. It was actually our architect who suggested the idea, you need a lot of height to install one, which we had with this treehouse. Originally it was planned for the outside, but it rains a lot in Wales, so it didnapost seem practical to have it out on the decking so we put it inside instead. Another feature to notice inside the treehouse is the intriguing wall dedicated to old doors, adding texture, colour and interest to the space, as well as a new upcycled lease of le for these  former front doors. There is also a slide for children - and probably adults too - to have fun. John said: In the past two weeks, weaposve added the  foot stainless steel slide on the decking, made from reclaimed materials. Itaposs about -years-old but weaposve cleaned it up, so technically itaposs aposvintage.apos  He said that at first they wanted to build something futuristic, but after looking at the designed they decided to go for something more traditional - with some modern touch. The couple added they wanted to use sustainable material in constructing the treehouse. John said: The front section is made from reclaimed oak beams which could be  years old. I actually bought them a couple of years ago thinking we might build a treehouse - so itaposs amazing to finally see it come to fruition. The cladding we used is also made of leftover bits of board which are about  years old, but we repurposed. But one of my favourite features is the roof which is made out of recycled plastic slates. I wish weaposd known about them sooner so I could have used them on the other two treehouses. They are unreal and should last for le. Over the years of constructing their treehouse business called Squirrelaposs Nest, the couple have learnt as they have progressed through this unique property construction journey. John says: The other two treehouses both took around  months to build, but we had some really bad weather, wind and rain. And with the first treehouse we had three foot of snow and actually lost some materials - we couldnapost find them until it melted! This latest build was not struck by compilations of the weather but by the global coronavirus pandemic, but it was still their fastest construction so far.John says: From start to finish, it took us six months - our quickest build yet, this was despite delays from suppliers due to Covid. Materials which would usually take two weeks to order, we had to wait eight weeks or more. There were also huge delays with the glass which held things up a bit, as we couldnapost do any internal work until that was in. We started the build in May , so it was spring and we had lovely weather, so we were lucky with that. We completed in October  and weaposre pretty pleased with that result. It cost us around £, to build it from scratch. Now that this latest luxury treehouse is ready to welcome guests, the couple couldnapost be happier with the outcome and struggle to decide which aspect of the structure ultimately wins their hearts. John said: I think itaposs the upstairs living space because of the views. This is the first treehouse where we have the living area upstairs, so itaposs a bit topsy-turvy in that respect. He added: Being a carpenter, Iaposm really pleased with the oak glazed gable as it has so much character. I also like going underneath the treehouse and looking up at it. Itaposs big anyway, but it just looks ginormous! Laura said: I love the downstairs dining kitchen area, itaposs the only treehouse that has a dining table.

The mercury is expected to drop to -C in parts of Scotland overnight following highs of C in southern England.The freezing weather front well and truly signals an end to the unseasonal late-March sunshine and warmth Brits basked in at the start of this week.Sunbathing in the park is off the cards for Bank Holiday Monday, with snow warnings in place for northern Scotland. As much as cm is forecast to fall in higher areas.The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings from pm on Sunday until am on Tuesday for Scotland, where winds of up to mph forecast.Itaposs not just the northern end of the Isles that are in store for an Easter dusting however. Coastal areas of eastern England, parts of Wales and Northern Ireland could also see snow showers on Easter Monday. Met Office forecaster Sarah Kent said: We will see this plunge of much colder conditions coming in. Itaposs Arctic maritime air, which does mean itaposs coming from the Arctic. So itaposs going to be cold for everybody, but also windy too.  The wind chill is going to be signicant. Matthew Box, a Met Office forecaster, described the weather front as an Artic blast. It will be quite severe frosts across the northern part of the UK, he said.  They will affect mainly Scotland, but snow showers will affect parts of northern Ireland, north Wales, Norfolk and East Anglia as well. Southern England can expect to see some sunshine and highs of C later on Monday, but gusts of up to mph will make the temperature feel like -C, Ms Kent said. All of the UK but a slim stretch of England along the south coast will be enduring temperatures that feel like theyaposre below zero tomorrow morning and early afternoon.  England and Wales will warm up a little as the day goes on, but only to highs of C come the evening. Parts of the UK saw the mercury reach nearly C on Wednesday, a balmy high that puts today and tomorrowaposs weather in harsh contrast. Meteorologist Ms Kent said: Today is a lovely day for an Easter egg hunt in the back garden, whereas tomorrowyou were doing one youaposd probably want to wear three jumpers. Deputy Chief Meteorologist, Mark Sidaway, said: “After a settled, warm spell with plenty of sunshine particularly across England and Wales our weather will take a notable change in direction later in the weekend. Very cold Arctic air will move in from the north west through Sunday, bringing snow showers and freezing overnight temperatures.  The snow showers will predominantly affect the north and west of the UK. The south and east will likely remain drier but still cold with a lower chance of wintry showers.” As well as scuppering plans to get out and about in slightly lighter clothing towards the tail-end of the long weekend, the cold weather will prove a big challenge to the agricultural sector. Phil Stocker is the chief executive of the National Sheep Association, spoke of the dangers of a cold snap during the lambing season.  “Sheep and livestock farmers, especially in the UK’s uplands, are acutely aware of the potential for a spring cold snap which can bring devastation and soul-destroying losses during lambing time, he said. The sector has endured several cold weather events during recent springs and these have wrought considerable hardship to both stock and hill farmers. However, being aware of the approaching change in weather type will allow farmers to buffer the impacts by taking action to avoid the worst losses.” Gardeners who have been preparing their lots for the summer may also be frustrated by the icy temperatures.

Hopefully, it won’t be too long for most of the lads.“We’ll have Fin back for the summer in pre-season. That’s a wee test for him that I’m sure he’ll come through with flying colours.“Everybody  is healthy and good to go.”Shining more light on Sow’s problem, hamstring tightness, McPake is happy the striker came off when he did as he pulled up in last weekend’s - win over Dunfermline.The Dee gaffer added: “It’s not a tear. It’s just tight and, to be fair to the big man, he’d been carrying it for a wee while.“Danny Mullen wasn’t right. He only trained last Friday morning so we’d done all our prep with Osman in the team and then, unfortunately, it got tight in the game.“He looked after it, we’re glad he done that, and Danny went on and did well.“We got pretty lucky with that because he probably wasn’t quite ready to play that amount of game time.“It worked out OK for us in the end.”With so many battling with their fitness, McPake would be forgiven for using this afternoon’s cup clash with Saints as an opportunity to get minutes in legs.However, he insists their focus is on progression and that means picking the strongest team available.“I see it as a cup-tie that we’ve been building up to all week,” he said.“The league’s been put to the side. People will say I’m lying but I’m not, the Scottish Cup is a hugely important tournament for every club in Scotland.“We want to progress and I see it as a chance to play against a very good St Johnstone side that have cemented their place in the top six and already won a cup.Dundee v St Johnstone: Where on TV can you watch Saturday#s all-Tayside Scottish Cup clash \" title\"#Dundee v St Johnstone: Where on TV can you watch Saturday#s all-Tayside Scottish Cup clash # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-v-st-johnstone-where-on-tv-can-you-watch-saturdays-all-tayside-scottish-cup-clash embed # secretVRjCdBV\" data-secret\"VRjCdBV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“Taking away everything they’ve done this season, this is their biggest game and because it’s the next one it’s ours, too.“Our biggest aim was promotion but when the cup comes around it takes up your full week.“I’m not going to rubbish it and say I see it as a chance to play squad players or fringe boys because our full squad is going to be needed between now and the end of the season.“I think it’s paramount that everybody is at a level anyway. Most of the players are at the minute.“It’s an important game and we’ll pick the team we believe can go out and give a very good account of Dundee Football Club and give us a chance to beat a very good St Johnstone team.”As for the Perth men, McPake has been impressed with the job boss Callum Davidson has done in guiding his side to the top six and a Betfred Cup season in his first season in the McDiarmid Park dugout.And, having crossed paths with Davidson on coaching courses, he’s not been surprised by the success either as his Dark Blues side aim to cause an upset.McPake continued: “Callum’s done an excellent job.“I really like him and, first and foremost, he’s a really good guy.“Myself and Davedid our Pro Licence with him and he’s a fantastic coach.“The job he’s done there is remarkable,I’m honest. The way he’s got his team playing, they’re good to watch in the system he plays.“They’re very fluid and a real threat. To go and win a cup, even in the games against Celtic and Rangers I’ve watched them in, they’ve been in those games.“They’ve never really been out of games and that’s credit to Callum and his coaching staff.“Our aim is to put a good show on for Dundee and give them a real test when they come here.“We’re at home and we’ve got to try to take the game to them.“We know it’s going to be really tough, we’re under no illusions that any game is easy, but add in what they’ve done this season and it makes it even harder.“It’s a cup-tie and it’s a game we’re really looking forward to.“You need a level of performance to win any game but for this we need to be at our very best, I believe.“It takes that performance against Dunfermline, minus the first six minutes, or the one we had at Hearts here .“We need to hit those levels right through the pitch to give ourselves a chance.”Dundee #thirtysomethings# desperate to cap careers with silverware, says Dark Blues assistant Dave Mackay\" title\"#Dundee #thirtysomethings# desperate to cap careers with silverware, says Dark Blues assistant Dave Mackay# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp  embed # secretULCBLVFMi\" data-secret\"ULCBLVFMi\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/11/20014320_37093249-e1606753677725-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee st johnstone charlie adam not derby","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee captain Charlie Adam is looking to get one over Tayside neighbours St Johnstone # but insists the Dark Blues# Scottish Cup clash with the Perth men is not a derby.Saints come to Dens Park today with both sides seeking progress into the last .The stakes are high but Adam says that stops at football, with no local bragging rights on the line.For Dundonian and dyed in the wool Dee Adam, there is only one derby.The -year-old said: “It is not a derby. There is only one derby for us.“This is just another game for us against a club that has done well under Tommy Wright winning the Scottish Cup.“They have now won the League Cup, are in a good bit of form and have a couple of decent players.“But the derby for us is across the road and they are the ones where,you get an opportunity to play against your rivals United, they are the big games for us.“This is not a derby for us – it is just another game in the Scottish Cup.”Despite their success in making the top six and winning the Betfred Cup, Adam also insists the McDiarmid Park men are not an inspiration for Dundee.The former Rangers, Liverpool and Scotland man says the chance of lting silverware is the only motivation the Dee need.“We don’t take inspiration from anybody ,” he said.“We look at ourselves and what we can do within the walls of the stadium and what we can control.“We knowwe can be more consistent than what we have been, then we will have a chance of getting promoted.“I don’t look at anybody  and thinkwe do that then we will end up like that. We focus on ourselves.“We are a good football club and we will look to win games between now and the end of the season. Hopefully, that Dunfermline resultcoming back from - down can spur our season on.“Obviously, the Scottish Cup is something dferent andyou get through you might have an opportunity to play one of the Old Firm or an Aberdeen where it is another big challenge.”Dundee go into the cup meeting as underdogs to Premiership St Johnstone and Adam reckons it’s a role that could suit his side.Regardless of the opposition, playing at Dens in a one-off tie makes it a level playing field for the midfielder and his team.“We played Hibs earlier this season and did well for  minutes. We lost a couple of bad goals but in the second game we lost - but played well in that so there is nothing to fear,” he added.“It is not aswe are going in against Celtic or Rangers – something like that.Scottish Cup build-up: The seven St Johnstone and Dundee players who could have ended up in the other team\" title\"#Scottish Cup build-up: The seven St Johnstone and Dundee players who could have ended up in the other team# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football st-johnstone  scottish-cup-build-up-the-seven-st-johnstone-and-dundee-players-who-could-have-ended-up-in-the-other-team embed # secretqaUleRwSM\" data-secret\"qaUleRwSM\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“We are playing St Johnstone. We are confident and have a good side on our day.“Listen, they’ll be worried as well. They’ll be sat thinking: ‘Right what are they going to do  They are going to cause us problemswe are not at it’.“We just have to worry about ourselves. If we win it, we are into the next round and we will take that into a run of games in the league where it is important we win a few matches.”Due to spending much of his career down south with the Reds, Blackpool, Stoke City and Reading, Adam doesn’t have much in the way of Scottish Cup memories.He often wasn’t involved in the Gers’ glories but does have experience in the competition as a young player on loan at St Mirren in the   season.“I don’t have too many actually,” he tried to recall.“My recollections of the Scottish Cup would probably be more of being at St Mirren when we beat Motherwell - and I scored two goals.“We had played Spartans on a Sunday afternoon and I remember the park we played on but that’s the enjoyment of the Scottish Cup as you don’t normally get to go to these places so it is dferent.“We played Gretna as well but we lost -. We probably should have won that.“But I don’t really remember too much about playing in the Scottish Cup for Rangers.“Listen, the tradition is there, the history of the Scottish Cup is massive and it doesn#t matteryou are playing at Rangers, Celtic or Annan, Alloa it still has the magic.“It is a big game and there is always a buzz about the place.“It is just a shame there will be no supporters here as there would have been a decent crowd.”Adam hopes to take to the pitch this afternoon feeling revitalised after enduring recent spells on the sidelines through Covid- self-isolation and suspension.It’s been a dficult period for the Dee’s talisman but he has been impressed with how the team have performed in his absence.Adam commented: “It has been a frustrating few weeks, missing the games with Covid and then trying to get back to a fitness level where I was able to go and compete.“The last couple of games I have been on the bench and then I was suspended.“But that is over with and the focus is on now and the end of the season to win as many games as we can to get into the play-offs.“I will be trying to get back into the team as the lads have won a few games, so I just have to be ready and hopefully the opportunity comes today.”Dundee assistant boss Dave Mackay insists there is no huge gulf in quality between Dark Blues and Scottish Cup foes St Johnstone\" title\"#Dundee assistant boss Dave Mackay insists there is no huge gulf in quality between Dark Blues and Scottish Cup foes St Johnstone# #

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay across the North East, and I know this must be a really dficult time for the  members of staff.#I hope that a solution can be found that will allow John Lewis to maintain a presence in the city.#The Covid pandemic and its accompanying restrictions have accelerated problems that already existed for retail and our town centres.#Aberdeen has also been hit worse than most, with a collapse in oil prices and a business rates system that takes far more than it gives.#The truth is that the SNP government hasn’t given the region the attention it deserves.#That#s why I launched a campaign last week for a fair share for the north-east, including a £ billion regional enterprise agency, upgrades to key infrastructure, and rolling out broadband far faster than the SNP.#“Our high streets have been decimated through the pandemic and the loss of John Lewis is a terrible blow for Aberdeen city centre, its employees and customers.“Scottish Labour is a pro-business party and is committed to launching a Business Network to establish solid relations with employers across the country.“City centre businesses will be vital in rebuilding our economy. We will focus on jobs and retail to help kick start our post-pandemic recovery, and ensure our high streets thrive once more.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: #The closure of John Lewis leaves a major hole in the middle of Aberdeen. We are determined to build a strong and flourishing economy in the North East so that we can sustain international brands like John Lewis in the city.“In the recent Scottish budget the Scottish Liberal Democrats secured £m for transition training specically for the North East boost the economy and new industries.#Under Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals, we will reform business rates to take the burden off high street retailers and give those shops the ability to compete with online retailers.#We will also give local authorities more powers to get to reshape their city and town centres into vibrant and flourishing places that people want to visit, spend money and set up shop.#“The John Lewis closure is devastating news for the workers and it shows how we really need to rethink our high streets after the pandemic, to make them more resilient and focused on the communities that live in and rely on them.#If we want our town centres to thrive, we need attractive public urban spaces that people want to spend time in.#This means levelling the playing field for independent shops, cooperatives like John Lewis and for community spaces, and stop giving tax-dodging online retailers incentives and tax breaks.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

programme now under way, we#ve put together a collection of Covid vaccine tracker charts to monitor the progress of the Covid- vaccine rollout across the UK.How many people have been vaccinated How many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range as well as the percentage of that population covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March. The chart below shows the percentage of each group who have received their first and second doses.The vaccines are being provided in accordance with the priority list drawn up by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation .

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval. No change there then!When I observed the work, I was so surprised at the dference this will make to the town and to the moaners I say #you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs#.When I spoke to them, the workforce were polite and commented that they were looking forward to the end result.For too long now Lochgilphead has been the Cinderella of Argyll and Bute now it seems she will go to the Ball.From a very satisfied resident.Name and address suppliedSir,Just ahead of WWF’S Earth Hour last year, the country was put into lockdown due to the Covid- pandemic. As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all. Find out more at the www.wwf.org.uk website.I look forward to seeing the things you believe will make Scotland a better place, perhaps changing the way we heat our homes, how we travel around our towns and cities, or even how we grow the food we eat.Lang Banks, director, WWF Scotland, EdinburghSir,Tuesday March  marked the anniversary of the day the UK entered lockdown.

Being a member of the NQ group is a step forward in ensuring youth participation is standard rather than tokenistic.##Of course representing the young people of Argyll and Bute has been a huge honour and a privilege,# added Cameron.#It’s been amazing to meet and work with so many incredible young people across the constituency, who will continue to do our area proud.#The SYP is entirely youth-led, representing Scotland’s young people. Elections are held every two years and people aged from  to  from across Scotland stand as candidates in all  local authority areas and from national voluntary organisations.The next SYP elections are due to take place at the end of this year, but Cameron will not be standing again in Argyll and Bute, though does intend to do so in another constituency.He said: #I would encourage any young person in Argyll and Bute considering standing for SYP to do so.#Young people can register an interest now by contacting the Argyll and Bute Council#s community learning team or by checking SYP#s social media accounts for more information # @OfficialSYP.Reflecting on the past week Cameron said: #I feel incredibly overwhelmed but really proud to have won MSYP of the Year. I absolutely was not expecting it.#Looking to le beyond the youth parliament, he continued: #My plans for the future are a bit uncertain. I’m currently taking on le’s twists and turns when they present themselves to me! I have a passion for politics so who knows where it might take me.#SYP has given me so many incredible opportunities that I am really grateful for as well as boosting my skills in campaigning, consulting and lobbying as well as hugely boosting my confidence.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 2 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year. Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.James O’Connell, Unite regional officer for Scotland.Sir,I work for a TV company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who are wanting to live a simpler le.

essential services such as supermarkets, public transport or GP surgeries.Initially, at least, they will also not be necessary to go to pubs or restaurants as they begin serving again.Ministers believe the scheme will be most useful in managing the risks where there are large numbers of people in close proximity such as music festivals, sporting matches and nightclubs.However more than  Tory MPs have signed a cross-party letter opposing vaccine passports while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has described them as ldquoun-British, raising the prospect of a potential Government defeatndash as expected ndash there is a Commons vote.Writing in The Daily , Sir Graham Brady, the influential chairman of the backbench Tory  Committee, said vaccine passports were ldquointrusive, costly and unnecessary.Under the plans set out at the weekend the certicates are expected to show whether an inidual has received the vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has ldquonatural immunity having tested positive in the previous six months.The Government is planning trials at a series of events over the coming weeks including the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield and culminating with the FA Cup final at Wembley on May .Initially they will not involve the use of certicates although spectators will be required to be tested for Covid- both before and after the event.vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Johnson will also use the news conference ndash a year to the day after he was admitted to hospital with Covid- ndash to set out further details of the framework for easing foreign travel restrictions ahead of the report of the global travel task force, which is due on April .While the ban on foreign travel from England will not be lted until May , Downing Street has said that when the rules are relaxed there will be a risk-based ldquotraffic light system with red, amber and green ratings for countries around the world.Travellers arriving from countries rated green will not be required to isolate although pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed.For those classed as amber or red, the restrictions will remain as they are

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#. In the long run, it is for your own good."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The first time that a second ballot was required, all with an amazing  per cent support of the community members who voted and the many organisations and iniduals who gave their time, effort and financial support to achieve this unprecedented result.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOWee Toon workers# nightmareThe Campbeltown area is one of the hardest places in Scotland to find a job.Analysts at Durham University using government figures have calculated that there are . people chasing every job vacancy in the Campbeltown Travel to Work Area.The figures for the three months up to January were . people chasing each vacancy.The February figures put Campbeltown and surrounding area at the top of the league table in Scotland for numbers of unemployed per vacancy.Islay and Mid Argyll were seventh in the table with . people chasing each job while Oban was st with ..Bottom of the table, the easiest place to find work, was the Aberdeen area.Since Durham University prepared its figures, Campbeltown has suffered two major jobs losses.Mull of Kintyre Seafood is expected to close next month with the loss of  jobs and last month Campbeltown Shipyard laid off  men, about one-third of its workforce.FIFTY YEARS AGOFishermen backed to the hiltCampbeltown Town Council is to urge the government to take #every possible step# to protect Scottish fishermen#s interestsBritain enters the Common Market.A resolution submitted by Mr AIB Stewart, secretary of the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, was unanimously accepted at a meeting of the council and representatives from the fishing industry.Fishermen stand to lose the protection of a -mile fishing limitthe country joins the Common Market.Mr Stewart said, with a trace of witty sarcasm: #Of course, inwe could fish in the Mediterranean.#He then referred to the large quantity of herring which was bought in Scotland by other countries, whose once huge fishings have finished.#They have over-fished their own grounds. Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me.

People were also forced to gather in evacuation shelters, making it harder to physically distance.A collection being carried out by A#Chleit, Clachan and Gigha churches will be sent to the WDP committee which has projects in Vanuatu to help with the aftermath of the most recent disasters.Everybody who participated in the service was given a bookmark to remind them of the country and its people.TARBERT:Organisers of Tarbert Seafood Festival have cancelled this year#s festival in light of ongoing Covid- restrictions around mass gatherings.The  festival was due to have been held over two days from July .While this news will likely disappoint the hundreds of people who flock to Tarbert for this popular, family-friendly weekend, the news is not all bad as organisers are confident this year#s Tarbert Music Festival will go ahead as planned from September  to .John Hardie of Tarbert Enterprise Company said: #While the recent announcement from the Scottish Government on the roadmap out of lockdown, together with the fantastic work being done by the NHS with its vaccine roll-out is encouraging, unfortunately it wasn#t enough to allow us to hold this year#s seafood festival safely.#Evenwe are in tier zero, as is hoped, by the end of June, restrictions on numbers of people attending mass gatherings will still apply. The festival is one of Scotland#s friendliest festivals with friends meeting up, milling around our many stalls and enjoying a drink in the sun while listening to live music, not to mention sampling some of the best seafood in the country.#This atmosphere is not something we could compromise for , but the  Tarbert Seafood Festival will certainly be an event worth waiting for.#He added: #We very much look forward to meeting friends, old and new, in September for this year#s music festival.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"easter egg competitions cracking entries","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause.

We were blown away by the talent of the young people and it was hard to choose the winners.#Fellow judges were Finlay MacDonald, director of piping at the National Piping Centre, and composer, broadcaster and musician Gary Innes.The event was played out over three nights last week on the Pipe Bands for Pupils Facebook page, attracting thousands of viewers, who also got a chance to vote for their favourite band.The championships are run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust which has supported piping and drumming in  local education authority areas with thousands of pupils getting lessons each week.The trust helps expand piping and drumming in Scotland#s state schools with cash grants for tuition. It also runs a free bagpipe and concert chanter lending service, and supports paid internships for aspiring tutors."},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us.

Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

We are incredibly grateful for these donations.#Lesley added: #Our plan is to have the young people, who are very eager to get started, involved every step of the way and to hand-build most of the items in the garden.#While there are no shortage of volunteers willing to help out with the project, the Youth Impact team is keen to hear from any tradespeople who would like to volunteer their their

with East Lothian residents electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson I SPENT last weekend in Dunbar and Haddington with local activists highlighting local issues of concern.The theme running through all of the problems we discussed is a lack of local empowerment.Too often, services are centralised and decisions are taken out of the hands of local people for example, the running down of services at Belhaven Hospital by the Scottish Government.If the SNP Health Secretary had agreed to a small upgrade grant back in -, signicantly more services could have been retained.Across the county, we see the same lack of joined-up thinking, with vast new housing estates lacking the essential additional infrastructure to support them: GP surgeries full, schools at capacity and non-existent public transport provision.A centralised police force has seen officers disappear from our streets.The closure of Haddingtonrsquos court forces victims and witnesses to travel into Edinburgh where there is a signicant backlog in cases.Liberal Democrats want to empower our communities to make decisions for themselves.The SNPrsquos centralising tendency damages our local services.Repeatedly, local decision-making is overturned by the Scottish Governmentrsquos reporters.Of course, media attention is focussed on the launch of the Alba Party and Kenny MacAskillrsquos defection.Mr MacAskill has said thatelected to Holyrood, he intends to stay an MP.Personally, I believe this is unacceptable.East Lothian deserves full-time representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.The other concern is that the SNP and Alba seem determined to turn this election into a referendum on independence.Itrsquos almost aswersquore not pinned down by a frightening pandemic asour economy is not on its knees aswe are not struggling against poverty and climate change emergencies asour education standards are not careering down international league tables.Letrsquos spend the next five weeks talking about what matters rather than a constitutional obsession.Craig Hoy NO SOONER was the election starting gun fired than blows were traded.Unlike normal campaigns, it wasnrsquot the cut and thrust of argument between parties hitting the headlines.Instead, Kenny MacAskill MP arrogantly turned his back on his SNP colleagues ndash and betrayed the trust of voters in East Lothian ndash by defecting to Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party.I will fight this campaign positively, asking for the support of every pro-UK voter in this constituency.While campaigning canrsquot take place in the usual way, I have already spoken with hundreds of constituents by telephone and have delivered thousands of leaflets.Two clear themes have emerged.Firstly, people are sick of the sleaze, ision and incompetence of this SNP Government.And they no longer trust Labour on the Union.Residents donrsquot want to be dragged back to the ision of another independence referendum.Instead, they want the MSP who succeeds Iain Gray to be a strong voice for the interests of local people.Thatrsquos why I have announced five-point plans for towns and villages across East Lothian.We need to create more jobs, improve education, stop overdevelopment and tackle problems such as drugs and anti-social behaviour.The issue of tactical voting has also come up on the lsquovirtual doorsteprsquo.Labour is weak on the Union and can no longer win this seat.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out giving Holyrood power to hold another independence referendum.Labour wonrsquot agree to form a pro-UK coalition in opposition to the separatists.Voters fear that Labour simply canrsquot say no to Nicola Sturgeon.Anas Sarwar helped Nicola pass the Hate Crime Bill and sat on the fence over her misleading Parliament.I am clear that a vote for any of the smaller fringe parties will only split the pro-UK vote.In East Lothian, there is only one way of using your two votes to stop the SNP.By voting for me in the constituency vote ndash and Conservative on the party ballot paper ndash we can block an SNP majority and another referendum.By doing that, you will guarantee the next parliament will be focussed on rebuilding the economy and our communities.Paul McLennan AFTER meeting a number of environment groups in the past few weeks, Irsquove taken time this week to reflect on how we transform how our economy operates with improved stewardship of our environment.Societyrsquos underlying health and a sustainable environment need to be measured by more than just figures on a balance sheet.The Wellbeing Economy Allianceurges transforming how the economy operates, warning that unless we rethink who wins and who loses out ldquowe wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.We can explore immediately green jobs for economic development, protect wild spaces for animals to thrive and iniduals to enjoy, and sustain our landscape.The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are renowned as Scotlandrsquos only two national parks as your MSP, Irsquod work with agribusiness, rural communities, environmental and other groups to investigate the feasibility of the Lammermuirs becoming a third national park.This echoes the call by the National Trust for Scotland to explore further options for national parks in Scotland.A natural boundary between the Lothians and the Borders, the Lammermuirsrsquo stunning landscape and history would attract locals to access nature and enhance wellbeing, boosting the rural economy.Other measures specic to East Lothian are achievable, realistic and right for now, including engaging in Scotland as a recognised lsquoRe-wilding Nationrsquo.As MSP, Irsquoll also support a feasibility study for Haddington train station a planning bill overhaul to ensure new-builds include electric car points and  per cent of transport budgets designated for active transport.As a government, the SNP has introduced world-leading climate change policies.We have pledged net-zero emissions by  and are on course to meet that target.Last year, we generated . per cent of our electricity demand from renewables.This is displacing millions of tonnes of carbon a year, bringing jobs and enormous socio-economic impacts to our communities.Iceland and New Zealand, successful small democracies led by women, joined Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon pioneered the lsquoWellbeing Economy Governments Grouprsquo.Highlighting the inter-connection of personal and national wellbeing, Nicola argued ldquothe goal of economic policy should be collective wellbeing: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy.I want East Lothian to lead on the transformative change our environment needs ndash we can be the change we all desire.Martin Whitfield I WAS joined by Scottish Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar and local party members at the launch of my campaign.Its key message is that Labour will focus on what unites us and on recovery ndash not another isive referendum.Mr Sarwar told the virtual meeting that a lsquonational recovery planrsquo for Scotland would be the centrepiece of Scottish Labourrsquos election campaign, covering key priority areas for recovery from Covid, including jobs, the NHS, education, climate and communities.Speaking after the launch, Mr Sarwar said: ldquoScottish Labour, under my leadership, will make a national recovery our only priority. Itrsquos only by voting for us that you can guarantee that we have a parliament focused on recovery.I have also hit the ground running with key local campaign calls, including reiterating my support for the reinstatement of a rail service and station for Haddington, and calling for a staffed shared banking hub to be piloted in Prestonpans to bring banking services back to the town.This election is all about how we recover and rebuild after the pandemic and the fairer future that local people can havewe work together to focus on recovery.East Lothian needs a recovery plan that will deliver local jobs, remobilise our NHS, provide children with a comeback plan, deal with the climate emergency and support communities to rebuild.These are the issues I will focus on over the coming weeks to ensure that East Lothianrsquos people, communities and organisations have the support they need to come back stronger after Covid-.While I am keen to have as much contact with local residents as is allowed under the current public health restrictions, these constraints mean it mostly needs to be online at the moment.I am also continuing my work as a teacher for the early part of the campaign, so my availability is restricted.Anyone who would like to speak to me either by phone or video call should email contactus@eastlothianlabourparty to set up a meeting.More information on my campaign is at facebook martinwhitfieldeastlothian or www.eastlothianlabourparty"},{"url":null,"title":"four-candidates-confirmed-scottish-parliament-election-2021-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Colin Beattie , Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytewere confirmed as the four candidates for the seat at the Holyrood election when nominations closed yesterday afternoon.Mr Beattie has represented the area in Holyrood since .

strange that our Holyrood constituency crosses county borders, with Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig on the east side of the boundary.There are similarities between Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-asssembly-rooms-flat-plan-rejected","story":"Dunbar Assembly

stop the building, built in , deteriorating further.: Assembly Rooms planThe basement of the B-listed at-risk building has already been converted into flats.Concern over plans to raise the height of

We did have concerns about raising of the roof height but note listed building consent has already been granted for that.ldquoThe lack of parking has been raised and we concur there is an issue however, we do not believe a lack of provision should be a reason for refusing this proposal.She pointed to other land at the site which remained derelict and could be used for parking spaces, while acknowledging it was a complex issue because of multipleownerships.And she questioned why no elected councillor had informed the community council that the application had been called in to be decided by the planning committee.The application was called in by Mr Hampshire after officers indicated their intention to approve it ndash information Mrs Bell believes should be shared with community councils as well.Following the decision, she said: ldquoYet again, the local community is not being heard and the building will be allowed to continue to rot because of lack of parking.ldquoThe community council was not told this application had been called in.ldquoThe community council and Shore and Harbour Group supported the application to save the B listed building.ldquoPlanning policy permits a reduction in parking provision where positive townscape benefits would result ndash the conversion of the Assembly Rooms and the saving of the B listed building at risk would be a positive townscape benefit."},{"url":null,"title":"caring-dunbar-day-centre-staff-take-road","story":"Dunbar Day Centre has sat empty for more than  months, with the role of staff changing.Jamie McNeil, manager of the building on Westgate, stressed that the doors might be closed but the service is very much still ongoing.He said: ldquoWhen the building closed, everything we had been offering stopped all that community interaction and respite care ceased.ldquoRoutine is essential for people with dementia, so we had to adapt and help, to continue our service but in a completely dferent way.ldquoWe started visiting only four people during lockdown one now that is .ldquoWe visit and chat, take members for walks to help their mobility.ldquoWe can help with shopping or just keep in touch.

We all know an insatiable Labrador .Labradors will devour everything they can get hold of. Some breeds are more picky and highly unlikely to eat anything other than a tasty morsel.There are some toy breed owners who would love their pet to eat a hearty meal every now and then.This is something to consider when buying a pup.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, behaviours, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.There are seven main classes of dog, each with their own characteristics. These are only guidelines and all dogs have their own characteristics.Border collies are generally very agile and not especially food-orientated ndash but recently, our receptionist Adele took an interesting call at our Dunedin Vets Tranent surgery, from Mrs Jane Green.She had been playing on the beach at North Berwick with her dog Zed, an exuberant -month-old Border collie. They had been having great fun on a dry, sunny morning when suddenly the ball she threw for Zed disappeared.Mrs Green was convinced Zed had swallowed it whole. There appeared to be no other explanation for the disappearing ball.Adele advised her to come to the surgery as soon as possible after ascertaining that Zed wasnrsquot choking.I have seen cases where hard balls have become lodged in dogsrsquo throats, cutting off the air supply and literally choking the dog. Always make sure the ball your dog is playing with is large enough not to lodge in their airway.Zed wasnrsquot choking and seemed remarkably bright.When he arrived at the surgery, Zed was examined by vet Rachel.She discussed the case with Mrs Green. Rachel could not feel the ball when she felt Zacrsquos abdomen, but Mrs Green was sure he had swallowed it and she showed Rachel a similar one, which was certainly too large to pass through his intestines.At this point, as vets we have to decide how to determineZed had indeed swallowed a ball, so we look to diagnostic imaging. The first thing we may consider is radiography.Only a few years ago,vets wanted to visualise the internal structures of your petrsquos body, a radiograph would be taken using an x-ray machine, which showed the image on a piece of photographic-type paper.The radiograph had to be processed manually in a dark room, using noxious chemicals, and it could take about  minutes to develop one plate.If several radiographs were required, the pet would be under anaesthetic for a prolonged period of time. Pets require sedation or general anaesthetic for radiographs to be taken.The patient has to be positioned correctly and be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken. This ensures the best image possible is produced at the first attempt and ensures minimal radiation exposure.Nowadays, we have digital x-rays. The patient still has to be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken but the processing is complete in under one minute.The images appear on a computer screen and can be viewed from dferent angles and intensities as required. Fewer radiographs need to be taken and patients are anaesthetised for much shorter times.After light sedation, Zed lay still to have his x-ray taken. This confirmed the ball was in his stomach, with the dense squeaker clearly visible.After discussion with Mrs Green, Zed went for surgery.

He was given intravenous fluid, pain relief and antibiotics to ensure good recovery and stop infection after his operation.Once he was awake and stable, he was transferred to our out-of-hours carers at the Braids Veterinary Hospital, where he was monitored constantly until he was allowed home the following day.Zed has been examined by several vets at Dunedin Vets since hishome and, although at first quite tender and not his normal happy self, he is improving and should be back to his lively, bouncy self pretty soon.Please ensure you do not give your pets items to play with that they could swallow.

He had a love spot on his forehead,anyone saw it theyrsquod fall in love with him.ldquoHandy, said Finn, amused by the idea.ldquoWell not always, so he kept it hidden under his long hair. But Grainne was smitten by him and so she had a plan.ldquoShe put a sleeping potion in Fionnrsquos drink and the drinks of others, then placed a sacred oath on Diarmuid so he had to go with her. They fled as Fionn slept. When he awoke he was enraged at the betrayal. He vowed revenge and hunted for them for many years.ldquoWait a minute, said her nephew. ldquoFionn didnrsquot love her did he  I mean they hadnrsquot met until then, so why was he so angry : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoHe saw it as a betrayal. Diarmuid had been one of Fionnrsquos closest friends now hersquod run off with the woman he was due to marry.ldquoBut she didnrsquot want to marry Fionn anyway.ldquoIt was the way of things in those days, women had no choice in who to marry. Thatrsquos why I like Grainne, she refused to accept it and ran off with the man she did love. She defied the greatest warrior that had lived as well as convention. There are many stories about her travels with Diarmuid, places they hid, the adventures they had. All this time Fionn was searching for them. When he finally found them, the years seemed to have softened his anger and they made peace.ldquoSo it was a happy ending then  I canrsquot see the connection to the name of this place, though, said Finn.ldquoThe tale is not finished. Izzy stopped walking to explain what happened next.: Chapter  of Tims BookldquoYou see, the way Fionn felt inside was not the way it showed on the outside. Bitterness still festered under the surface and it showed itself when he went hunting with Diarmuid and the other warriors of the Fianna.ldquoDuring the hunt, Diarmuid was attacked by a wild boar. A prophesy had told that he would be killed by a boar and the beast savaged him. He managed to kill it, but Diarmuid lay mortally wounded.ldquoThere was one chance to save him. If Fionn gave Diarmuid water to drink from his hands, his magical powers would save his le.ldquoAh, because of his magic thumb  wondered Finn.ldquoAye, well remembered Finn. There was no time to lose. Fionn rushed to a nearby burn, cupped his hands and brought water to the dying Diarmuid. But then...Izzy put her hand on her heart.ldquoThen what  her nephew asked, spreading out his arms in a questioning gesture.ldquoFionnrsquos anger and vengeance ed. He couldnrsquot forgive Diarmuid for his betrayal. So he deliberately let the water seep through his fingers.ldquoBut Fionnrsquos emotions were conflicting and when he saw Diarmuid dying on the ground his bitterness eased, and he ran back to the burn to collect water. But, as before, he let the water drain from his hands because, in the last moment, he still couldnrsquot forgive.: Chapter  of Tims BookIzzy began walking.ldquoSo he leaves Diarmuid to die  asked Finn, catching up with his aunt.She paused again.ldquoHis warriors, including Fionnrsquos own son Ossian, begged him to give Diarmuid water. They were all loyal to him, but they also loved Diarmuid. They had all suffered from the split between to two men they both loved.ldquoSo for a third time, Fionn ed to the burn. He walked carefully with the water in his hands. Memories of his old friendship flooded his mind. An understanding grew in him of the power of Grainnersquos love for Diarmuid and how dficult it had been for them. Fionn felt his bitterness and anger finally dissolve he could now forgive.ldquoHe knelt down by Diarmuid and carefully trickled the water onto his lips. But it was just too late.ldquoHe was dead Izzy nodded. Finn walked on, saying nothing.: Chapter  of Tims BookThey had reached the part of the trail where tall planted pine trees grew. There was the faint sound of running water below on their right and Izzy led Finn down a small path that zigzagged steeply down a slope.They reached a burn which tumbled down the glen, with native trees lining its banks.Izzy paused by a hazel tree that leaned over the burn to catch the sunlight. Finn arrived with a thoughtful look on his face.ldquoSo that story is how Creag an Tuirc got its name  he asked.Izzy was looking for hazelnuts, so she spoke as she knelt down and foraged.ldquoNobody knows for sure how it got its name. The tale of Grainne and Diarmuid is actually an ancient legend from Ireland, but legends and stories are carried by people and planted in new places.She stood up happy, holding a hazelnut between her thumb and finger. She put it in her pocket and looked at her nephew.ldquoThere was a shared culture and language here with Ireland. Creag na Tuirc was named in Gaelic in the mists of time. Was the story of Diarmuidrsquos death told here round the fireside  For sure it was. Was the rock named to give the tale a local setting  I like to think itrsquos possible. There are lots of places in the Highlands named after these old Celtic legends. Therersquos a place called Tor an Tuirc which means hill of the boar, near Oban, and close by there is a standing stone called Diarmuidrsquos pillar. Local people said it was where he was buried. So the stories were planted here many years ago and now have roots here too. In fact, just up the road there is what tradition says is Fionnrsquos grave.ldquoReally! Aw can we go there aunty, please : Chapter  of Tims BookldquoOf course, we might even be able to see it later today, Izzy assured him.She continued her search for hazelnuts and Finn helped, but they found no more.ldquoIrsquod hoped to find nine, explained his aunt.ldquoWhy nine ldquoIrsquoll tell you later, in a story, Izzy smiled.Finn was quiet as they walked down the path by the tumbling water. Suddenly, he recognised where he was: the waterfall theyrsquod passed earlier.ldquoYou stay here and enjoy the falls, Irsquoll meet you at Rob Royrsquos grave, said Izzy as she wandered back to Balquhidder Kirk.: Chapter  of Tims BookFinn stayed a while longer, watching the water cascade over the rocks. The sound soothed him and the damp coolness of the air was welcome in what was becoming a very warm day.He eventually walked back to the kirk and emerged from the shade of the trees to see his aunt talking to a man. They broke off their conversation as soon as they saw Finn and the man walked briskly away out of the kirkyard.ldquoJust a tourist asking about Rob Roy, she explained when she saw Finnrsquos inquisitive expression.Two women then arrived.ldquoDo you know where Rob Royrsquos grave is  they asked Finn. He smiled and pointed at it.ldquoCould you take our photo please  they asked.They stood by the graveside with their thumbs up as Finn clicked a couple of times to make sure. Finn was keen to explain the mystery of the grave but they didnrsquot linger. The women thanked him and left, happy theyrsquod got their photo.As they drove away, Finn noticed the other car parked in the small parking space.He was sure it was the same car which had been parked in the layby by Samsonrsquos Stone the day before. But he thought no more of it, as his stomach began to tell him it was time for some proper food.He looked for his aunt. She was in the th-century kirk, looking at a stone with a carving of a person on it.ldquoIrsquom hungry, can we go for lunch  Finn asked.ldquoSure.They walked back to the car through the wood and past the waterfall once again.On the way, Izzy pointed out the grave of Robert Kirkrsquos we, who had died young, and the faerie hill on the northern edge of the kirkyard.It was midday and the sky was almost a Mediterranean blue.They left Balquhidder and drove towards Kingshouse at the east of the glen, which was originally built to accommodate British army officers using the military road.Balquhidder had seen its share of Redcoat atrocities in the aftermath of Culloden in , as many MacLarens had come out for Bonnie Prince Charlie.The military road had been built to make transport of the military easier, and to supply the many British army forts located in the Highlands, which were garrisoned to keep an eye on potential Jacobite trouble.As they drove out of the glen towards Loch Earn, Izzy told the tale of Capt Donald MacLaren.He had joined the Jacobites during the rising of . He was wounded and captured, then taken on a journey to England for execution. But he managed to escape while passing a place called the Devilrsquos Beef Tub in the south of Scotland, and one tradition says he ed to Balquhidder and lived many years in disguise as a woman, despite being heavily built.She told it in a funny way and Finn laughed at the image of this big bearded man dressed as a woman fooling the soldiers.ldquoHow can you remember all these stories  he asked.ldquoI remember the pictures they paint in my imagination, replied Izzy.ldquoMaybe I sometimes get some of the details wrong but for me they are portraits in my head and so when I tell the story I just describe what I see. Thatrsquos the way I remember anyway.Finn understood what she meant. Her stories had helped him paint his own portraits in his head.He was silent for a while as Izzy drove, then said: ldquoI want to phone my mum.ldquoOf course sweetie, letrsquos find a phone box and seeshersquos free.Izzy felt a wave of anxiety. She was worried that Finn might have recognised who she had been talking to at Balquhidder. She also had emotions that were not showing on the surface.She asked herselfshe was she doing the right thing.

This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county.

Eggs symbolise new le, and often appeared in pagan festivals celebrating spring.And for Christians, the egg symbolises the moment in the Bible when Jesus is resurrected after his crucixion.As the tradition evolved over the centuries, chocolate versions of eggs became more popular as gts for children than real eggs - for obvious reasons.The first chocolate eggs appeared in France and Germany during the th century, but they were bitter and hard.Yet as chocolate-making techniques began to improve, Cadbury produced the first modern chocolate Easter egg that we enjoy today in .The chocolatier used a pure cocoa butter that could be easily moulded into the smooth shape.Hollow chocolate Easter eggs quickly became popular, and they still remain a favourite Easter tradition with many around the world.A lot of people also give up chocolate for lent, so indulging in some chocolate eggs became a common way to mark the end of the Christian fasting period.As well as consuming chocolate eggs, there are other egg-related Easter traditions that are synonymous with the religious holiday.Rolling hard-boiled eggs is a favoured activity, and for Christians this is a symbolic re-enactment of when the stone was rolled away from Christrsquos tomb in the Bible.Painting and decorating hard-boiled eggs is also a beloved tradition that children especially enjoy.These two activities often go hand-in-hand, with children painting their eggs before finding a hill to roll them down until they crack.An Easter egg hunt is another popular tradition many take part in over the Christian weekend.Chocolate treats are hidden around the garden or the house, ready to be found by family members - and the winner is the person who finds more than anyone .The Easter bunny is said to arrive over the weekend, hiding eggs for when children wake up on Easter Sunday.There are numerous tales surrounding the origins of the Easter bunny.One is that the rabbit comes from the ancient pagan festival of Eostre, which honoured the goddess of fertility and spring.Her animal symbol is believed to have been a rabbit, which traditionally represents fertility.Meanwhile, in America, some people believe that the Easter bunny was introduced in the s by German immigrants in Pennsylvania.Their egg-laying hare, known as ldquoOsterhase or ldquoOschter Haws, was said to lay colorful eggs as gts to children who behaved well.The Easter bunnys egg delivery then evolved over time to include treats such as toys and chocolate."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/12476011.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-ansell-views-scotlands-community-buy-outs-right-roam-good-ways-share-land","story":"Neil AnsellTinder Press, pound.Review by Rosemary GoringThe New Forest, on the south coast of England, is one of the few areas in Britain that has kept its original medieval character. Now a National Park, it is so heavily wooded that it is possible to walk for hours on end without breaking cover.Neil Ansellrsquos most recent book, The Last Wilderness, was about the north-west Highlands of Scotland. A former journalist, he is at his most content when alone with birds and his own thoughts. While the New Forest is hardly a wilderness ndash on one walk he encounters an ice-cream van, on another an outing of Jewish schoolboys ndash in certain ways it is the epitome of English wildness, the sort our ancestors would have found familiar. Created when William the Conqueror turned it into the first royal deer park, it is both rugged and tame. Its heath and forest stretch for miles, and while its main occupants are ponies, cattle, deer and wildle, it is marked by human activity, in recent times and long ago.The New Forest is Ansellrsquos home patch, and The Circling Sky is his version of a memoir. As you might expect of a man dedicated to observation, his personal history never swamps those he prefers to keep centre stage: butterflies and bluebells, the forestrsquos plentul fallow deer, but above all its birds. In the first of many laments for our depleted times, he notes that, compared to when he was a child in the s, there are now  million fewer birds in Britain.Brought up with his parents and brother in nearby Portsmouth, Ansell was  when he first visited the forest. An avid nature watcher, he kept a diary of his discoveries that, after his fatherrsquos death, he discovered stored in his bottom drawer. Theirs had not been the easiest of relationships.When Ansell was little, the house went on fire, and his father moved them to a cottage in an abandoned quarry. Here, he could roam the outdoors. For a child who was deaf in one ear, he writes, ldquoconversation was too much like hard work being on my own was like a holiday.Deciding to visit the forest over the space of a year, to renew his long-lost acquaintance, he writes: ldquoI want to see what has changed and what has stayed the same, what is lost and gone and what is holding strong in the forest and in myself.Starting in January , Ansell plunges into a teeming British habitat, and his own childhood. The two fit well, because he is an easy storyteller with a companionable style. He is also thrty with words in the way of those who are perhaps happiest when quiet.His year in the forest is painterly in its attention to colours, shapes and mood. His knowledge of birds is formidable, and with him we encounter goshawks, a great grey shrike and, most notably, his first glimpse of a honey buzzard. Such a sighting, he reflects, ldquoimprints itself on the mind, a frozen moment that almost seems to ide the relentless passage of le into a before and an after.Too clear-eyed to be lyrical, Ansell is resolutely unsentimental. His emotional response to the wilds is genuine, not fashionable. As his past is slowly revealed, with a father against whom he rebelled, a supportive mother, and the young daughters with whom he lives in Brighton, his voice carries the weight of someone who follows his own path, and is comfortable with who he is.His portrait of the forestrsquos residents, and his ruminations on its past, would be sufficient record of a remarkable place, but for Ansell that is not enough. ldquoNature writing may often be read for comfort and reassurance, but perhaps we need to allow a little room for anger, room for the ability to rage at everything that has been taken from us, and taken by us. Running throughout is his fury at the dispossession of ordinary people from the land, and the ruination of the environment by the same elite that owns most of the British Isles: ldquohellipwe are still living in what is largely a feudal system, thinly disguised under a wisp of democracy but designed to work primarily in the interests of a handful of privileged, entitled by birth and history.The New Forest was once home to travellers, who were corralled into camps. The last of them were evicted in the s, in scenes shameful to recall. Ansellrsquos own forebears were gypsies, and although it is a century since they lived here, it might explain his ease when sleeping under the stars.The stranglehold of the wealthy on the countryside, since the Middle Ages, and their mismanagement of it for profit, is the thread on which this book hangs. Today, % of land in the UK is still owned by aristocracy, and ldquo% is owned by a third of % of the population hellip Just % of the land area of Britain is available for us to live on. If we can afford it. He points to Scotlandrsquos community buy-outs and Right to Roam as examples of a better way to share the land, but a great deal of what he says about ongoing feudalism holds as true here as across the Border.Before the Enclosure Acts ndash more than  of them ndash much of Britain, he suggests, would have looked like the New Forest today: ldquoI see a landscape rich in le that looks a lot like what much of our countryside should by rights resemble. Not just a possible past, but a possible future too,only we were able to envisage a better way of being.This is not a perfect book. There are repetitions, and a chapter on a brief trip to Rwanda during the year is jarring. These apart, however, The Circling Sky is impressive and compelling. Treating the natural world with the respect and rigour it requires, Ansell also rails against the forces that have conspired to bring it almost to the brink. Whatever direction the wilderness next takes, you can be sure he will be there to watch."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12464303.jpg?type=article-full","title":"headline","story":"Also on the bill that night was the Australian band The Go-Betweens, one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the decade, but one that would find success frustratingly elusive. As Thorn sat in the dressing room, the door opened and the Go-Betweens drummer Lindy Morrison walked in asking to borrow some lipstick at the top of her voice. Older, noisier, more self-assured, Thorn was enthralled. ldquoYou looked like confidence ran in your veins, she writes of that first encounter.ldquoShe just seemed other, you know, Thorn says of Morrison now in March , nearly  years later. ldquoShe was older than me,  years older. I think that is important. I was only . I was still at that stage of being right at the beginning of everything, not really knowing who I was, who I wanted to be. Embarking on this career of being in the music business, but not at all sure whether I wanted to or how I was going to do it.ldquoAnd there she is. She seems on the face of it to be my opposite, in that she seems supremely self-confident, supremely self-defined, to know exactly who she is, to not take any shit from anyone. When yoursquore young and looking around for role models and examples of how to be, you seize upon people like that.It was to be the start of a friendship that would long outlast the bands the two women were members of back then. Some four decades later it has led Thorn to write a book about her friend, the reason she is talking to me on Zoom from her home in London this afternoon.Thorn would go on to see huge success as part of Everything But the Girl. Morrison would stay with The Go-Betweens until  when the band broke up after their last-chance album  Lovers Lane still didnrsquot make them stars. Although their paths erged in the intervening years, Thorn and Morrison, through ups and downs and though a world apart, remained in touch.Lindy-Morrison and Tracey Thorn on Hampstead-Heath,. Photograph Ben WattMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, then, is a story about friendship. But itrsquos more than that. Itrsquos also a vehicle for Thorn to write Morrison back into the story of The Go-Betweens, a band whose narrative has been continuously refined and reduced to that of the two songwriters, Robert Forster and the late Grant McLennan. In doing so, Thorn also tackles the wider subject of female erasure in music how men literally write women out of the story.The result is funny, candid and, as the pages pass, increasingly indignant. By the end you can feel the anger rising off the pages.It is also, for those of us who grew up worshipping at the altar of Forster and McLennan, something of a challenge. Have we as fans been just as guilty of that act of erasure It may also be the best book Thorn has written. It certainly feels the most open, the most candid in a way, assome of Morrisonrsquos energy and outspokenness has rubbed off on her friend on the page.ldquoI think thatrsquos true, Thorn acknowledges. ldquoI almost wanted to allow that to happen a bit, let the spirit of Lindy animate the book.And so here is Thorn talking about desire and distress, about recent relationship struggles with Watt, about swimming naked in a spa in Covent Garden. In writing as in le, Thorn has been emboldened through her friendship with Morrison.Morrisonrsquos own story goes like this. In Brisbane in the late s she was in her mid-twenties and in a female punk band called Zero when she met Robert Forster. He is some six years younger than her. His band The Go-Betweens are the antithesis of punk. But Morrison saw something in them, something in Forster certainly. Soon they became a couple and when Morrison joined The Go-Betweens as their drummer the band became worthy of notice.Tracey Thorn. Photograph: Edward BishopldquoShe made them a band, Thorn suggests. ldquoThey were fumbling along, two boys being a duo with these other members who came and went. They didnrsquot have a band identity. And then suddenly theyrsquove got Lindy Morrison who was already semi-famous in the relatively small music scene of Brisbane. That was an audacious act to get her to join them. It was a great thing to do. That was a strength that they should always have played up really.As the years went by the opposite happened. The band became defined by Forster and McLennanrsquos wordplay. They were a band who were loved for their lyrics. But would either have managed to get anywhere without Morrisonrsquos drive, Thorn asks Morrison adapted her playing to their songs. ldquoShe didnrsquot straighten them out, Thorn points out. ldquoThey did have that sort of angularity about them. They didnrsquot know how many bars they were writing. They just wrote how many bars it needed to get to the end of that line of lyric.Read More: Remembering the Go-Betweens with Robert ForsterRead More: Christmas with Tracey ThornldquoA more prosaic drummer might have said, lsquoOK, you need to edit this a bit. We need to square it off.rsquo She said, lsquoWell, letrsquos go with it. Let the songs have this curiousandyoursquove written it like that, Irsquoll play it like that.rsquo That gives the band a lot of character.There were constant tensions in the band, it should be said. Forster and Morrison eventually fell out yet continued to play together. McLennan, meanwhile, never seemed to like Morrison. When Amanda Brown joined the band she was McLennanrsquos girlfriend, but she was also an ally for Morrison.What is very clear from the book is that when Morrison joined the band she was the one with the le experience. Itrsquos also quickly clear that even sensitive young men with an interest in art and literature can be painfully conventional in their attitude towards women.ldquoThatrsquos often one of the most frustrating things, I think, for women in the music scene or probably other worlds of art, Thorn suggests. ldquoYoursquore drawn to those scenes for the same reasons as men are, because yoursquore looking for freedom and liberation from the straight world and yoursquore looking for expression and to shake off the conventions.ldquoAnd then, within that world of music, when you encounter the same narrow thinking, the same conventions, the same prejudices, the same stereotypes, its intensely frustrating. And when you encounter that in the men you are working with, who you have been drawn to because you admire their creativity and artistry, itrsquos a really frustrating thing.That played out in Morrisonrsquos encounters with male music journalists. She was too loud for them, too outspoken. She didnrsquot fit with their idea of the band. Frankly, some of them were scared of her.After years of never quite making it, Forster and McLennan decided to go solo in . Forster arranged to tell Morrison at exactly the same time as McLennan told Brown, a move that was both theatrical and spectacularly foolish as it turned out. ldquoThe brutal display of where the power lies, is how Thorn describes it in My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend. Both women understandably saw it as an act of betrayal. How could the two men have thought they would see it as anything  ldquoIt is extraordinary and naiumlve, Thorn agrees. ldquoThey try to excuse themselves. lsquoWe were just bumbling boys.rsquo They were men in their thirties. It is very easy for men to play this card: lsquoOh well, we didnrsquot know what we were doing.rsquo At some point you have to take responsibility.In the years after the band split up and particularly after the tragically early death of McLennan at just  of a heart attack, the story of The Go-Betweens has been increasingly retold as the story of the two men. Thatrsquos certainly how Forster framed it in the title of his memoir Grant  I.And so, one of the reasons Thorn wanted to write My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend, she says, was the fear that Morrison was in danger of being left out of the story.This is the crux of things. This idea of erasure. It repeats and repeats in the music industry. Itrsquos why someone like Bjork has to time and again assert her own agency when she makes music, why she has to remind people that she is responsible for it, not her male collaborators.ldquoItrsquos endless, Thorn agrees. ldquoAnd it becomes exhausting, and so I think sometimes women fall by the wayside because they get defeated by it and also start to believe their own press. You start to believe, lsquoMaybe I wasnrsquot that important.rsquoMy Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend is an act of reclamation, then.ldquoI think that itrsquos happening more and more now. More and more women are starting to write their books, from Viv Albertine to Chrissie Hynde. It does feels to me some of these stories that had slipped out of our attention hellip When you look back at punk it was always the Sex Pistols and The Clash. Yeah, but hang on. I was there. X-Ray Spex and The Slits were as important. But those stories are now being told.If nothing , My Rock rsquonrsquo Roll Friend serves as a reminder that without Morrison the story of the Go-Betweens would be a lot less interesting. Because for all her complexity and vulnerabilities what emerges from the pages of Thornrsquos book is just how much fun Morrison was and is.ldquoAs well as there being anger in there, I did want there to be joy, Thorn admits. ldquoAs I say at one point, lsquothe sheer f****** buzz of being in her company.rsquo I want that to come through the book as well. That yoursquore just thinking, lsquoMy God, shersquos a hoot.rsquoldquoShe is and shersquos unpredictable and shersquos contradictory and you donrsquot know what shersquoll say next. All that about her is kind of brilliant. Shersquos not a neatly packaged entity.What does that make her  Human, I guess. And fun to be with.

They would sing in chorus: ldquoWersquore the bar-room mountaineers.Their memory comes to me often and not just in idle reminiscence. There is now a regiment of walkers that does not restrict manoeuvres to country hills or mountains. I know this. I am that soldier.This is largely an army of veterans. They are camouflaged by their ordinariness but they can be identied by Rab or North Face unorms and exposed completely by the discovery of a bus pass in the inside pocket of their gilet.The Glasgow isionhas its natural habitat around the canal at Maryhill. They do venture into the West End ndash the most extravagant carry those walking poles ndash and they have been known in pre-Covid times to remove a loyalty card from the bus pass holder and have a coffee on Byres Road, the base camp one of the ancient walkerati. HUGH: Museum of memoriesWe are a tribe that speaks to the notion of the lucky generation: fully pensioned, partially fit and liberally endowed with the blessing of free time. My grandparents worked until death.One grandparsquos idea of free time was to arrive home on a Friday to hand over his wage packet, retrieve his pocket money, pick up a towel and head to Shettleston baths for his weekly soak. The other grandfather did the same but complemented this in a spectacular show of bravado by finishing his evening at Ashfield dugs.They would be mildly amused by the antics of their grandson. Walking was something the poor did. And all of it on the way to and from work.Yet now we pensioners march continuously. Covid has not deterred us. Indeed, spring has sprung and so have the old wayfarers. We have, though, awoken to a new world.Early Covid jaunts were restricted to circuits of my local park. The slight loosening of restrictions means the city centre is within my field of exercise.I advance from dferent angles. I am joined by others trekking the same routes. There is a continuous, consistent band of marchers heading towards the city centre asbidding to put it under some sort of benevolent siege, aswilling it to be once again revitalised.It is a destination that invites sober reflection whatever the weather. The urban landscape has changed, perhaps irredeemably. The walkers can resemble the Viggo Mortensen character from The Road, though with better hair care and the reluctance to push a shop trolley anywhere outside of Waitrose.But there is a quiet but awful devastation in the city centre. Stripped of people, bereft of energy, the empty streets whisper a warning. Nothing is going to be the same.My jaunts are predicated on the wisdom that the best way to walk though Glasgow is looking up. This reveals the beautul architecture of the city in the most unlikely of spots. Famously, the corner of Union Street and Gordon Street is a place to tilt back the head and sigh in wonder. In the time of the plague, this can be done without being trampled to death by a wave of commuters. It is impossible, though, to avoid the conclusion that other dangers are pressing.The city centre has now been left to the dispossessed, the conscripted zero hour worker and the curious pensioner. It cannot be sustained by these cohorts.My route the other day was from the western approaches, down Sauchiehall Street and then on to Buchanan Street before looping back home though Anderston.It is impossible to imagine these areas being revived without an industrial-sized defibrillator. This resuscitation has to include bold thinking and the sort of money we normally reserve for unused nuclear weapons.The problem is stark in Glasgow but it exists in every city centre. There has to be a strategy to make cities attractive to commercial investors and to potential residents. There are straightforward ways to address this crisis. The first is that the economic regeneration in retail has to be financed by taxes on online companies. The disparity in prices means that the traditional retailer faces extinction with the battle flags of Debenhams, Jenners and others already in the hands of the online forces who are laying waste to the High Street.There is, of course, an acceptance that the old days cannot . There is no hope, for example, of seeing a line of retailers march back on to Sauchiehall Street. But this space offers opportunity.Can affordable housing, aimed at the young, be provided where once there was a department store  Could le be breathed into the city centre by encouraging families to set up there and create all the ancillary benefits and facilities that this would require Covid has had its unremitting awfulness. But it has shown us that there is, indeed, a magic money tree and it can be shaken to provide the fruit for economic renewal and sustenance. HUGH: Nuisance calls drive me madThe city centres are in terminal declinebold action is not taken now. They should be the hub of the community, the centre of commerce and the host to visitors from near and far. They are in danger of becoming husks, testying only to decline and fall.This generation of politicians must heed the warnings or the pensioner army might be the only invading force, now and in the future, for our traditional heartland.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12358122.jpg?type=article-full","title":"brian-taylor-independence-snp-dream-hesitates-speak-name","story":"I took the opportunity to ask Labourrsquos then General Secretary, Jack McConnell, to confirm that the electoral system planned for the devolved Scottish Parliament had been devised specically to prevent the SNP from taking power with a minority of the popular vote.With admirable brevity, Mr McConnell replied: ldquoCorrect.Mostly deploying ier statements, Jack McConnell went on to serve as First Minister for a prolonged period, surmounting the proportional voting system by sustaining a coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats. He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond.

It concluded there is no evidence of institutional racism in the UK. Either the commission didnrsquot do its research, or its report was written to please its political masters. After all, it gets the Government off the hook:therersquos no racism, therersquos nothing to tackle.I agree the phrase ldquoinstitutional racism has been overused since it appeared in Lord Macphersonrsquos report on the politan Police investigation of the brutal, racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. However, there are still many organisations in the UK that can be described accurately as institutionally racist.I retired just over a year ago after a -year career flying for the UKrsquos national flag carrier. A well-paid job, with unrivalled opportunities to explore the world, and one to which many young people aspire. Yet only about one per cent of the airlinersquos pilots are from ethnic minorities, despite them comprising % of the population around the airlinersquos base at Heathrow. Itrsquos disingenuous in my view to pretend that racism doesnrsquot play some part in the disparity.Racist language in my workplace, the aircraft cockpit, was common. I used to describe it as a canteen culture: one where a relatively small number of pilots used grossly racist language, without challenge. And they werenrsquot challenged by the great majority who disapproved because the language was accepted as the norm because those using the offensive language were usually older, more senior pilots and because neither the management team nor the union was interested in doing anything about it.To give an example without using language unfit for publication: when I was a first officer, a captain I flew with told me he didnrsquot like Indian women, he thought they were dirty. When I complained, I was told by a manager that awkward people like me would have ldquodficulties when we were assessed by the training department, and both my chief pilot and the chair of my section of the union told me that racism is normal.Thatrsquos why this was institutional racism the racists were allowed to spout their bile unhindered by those above them. As Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at Holyrood, said about another wrong: to permit is to promote. Unacceptable behaviour happens in most workplaces, and in too many cases senior managers simply look the other way.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.REPORT RIFE WITH EXCEPTIONALISMTHE recent report by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities will no doubt be talked about for years, but what struck me most about it are the numerous incongruities. To date, there have been at least six such, or similar, reports, so why call this one \"The\" Report  Why not simply call it \"a\", or even better, \"another\" report  Also, while we are told that there were \" of us\" on the commission, I counted nine, with two co-optees ndash three of whom have been adorned with CBEs and three with MBEs. To give further credibility, however, all, with one exception, are \"from ethnic minority backgrounds\" ndash demonstrating that it is possible to skew representation when it is desirable to do so.Poetry is truly alive, however, because \"Yes, there are still some lsquosnowy white peaksrsquo at the very top hellip But some of that snow is melting\". And the evidence is \"the greater presence of ethnic minorities in the current government and opposition hellip Chancellor of the Exchequer, Attorney General, Business Secretary and Home Secretary\". Someone needs to explain to the commissioners that it is like saying that the British working class has nothing to worry about because the Prime Minister is, like them, white.Equally irritating was the statement that we may need a \"lexicon of well-known British words which are Indian of origin\". Apart from the fact there is one already , I think we should tackle the fact that the English language is possibly the one language that has the most obnoxious racist slangs .The worst is the suggestion , that notwithstanding the world-wide atrocities of the British Empire, it was worth it because \"there is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African Britain\". Implying that they should be grateful for small mercies perhaps As with Brexit, though, it is exceptionalism all over again, England Britain being \"a beacon to the rest of Europe and the world\".

Certainly, Easter is a good time to talk about God. First of all, free speech is paramount and no one need worry about defending God. As CS Lewis said, ldquoI would as soon defend a lion. However, the topic of God is surely worth serious consideration.Mainstream Christianity makes a unique claim, namely there is a transcendent God who not only created the universe but finally entered into our world as a person, Jesus, who in turn lived, died on a cross and rose again. That is the Easter message. Such belief has transformed countless lives, arguably usually for the better.Now secularists may dismiss all that, albeit hopefully not without serious consideration of the evidence, but as Chuck Colson said, ldquo we are wrong perhaps we have missed a few things butthey are wrong they have missed the whole show.

Indeed, in rejecting Salmondrsquos idea of a two-party supermajority as ldquogaming the system she may have skewered indyref.After May ,her pro-independence majority is composed, as looks likely, of SNP constituency and Green list MSPs, it will be hard to claim this as a new mandate for a referendum.Boris Johnson will just quote her own words back at her. Holyroodrsquos AMS system was designed precisely to prevent any one party securing an overall majority. Alex Salmond was able to beat drsquoHondt in  only because of a unique set of circumstances.However, I do not subscribe to the view that the First Minister has given up on Scottish independence. It is in her DNA as much as it is in Alex Salmondrsquos. However, her body language in last weekrsquos BBC debate, in which she was hectored and harried over the timing of indyref, indicated her discomfort with the whole question.She clearly has other things on her mind ndash the pandemic for one ndash and has now shted the rhetoric on independence totake that into account. Independence is no longer to be seen as a necessary condition for a successful recovery, but something only to be considered ldquoafter the crisis is over, as she put it. That crisis could last for some years yet.The Scottish economy was lagging behind the rest of the UK before Covid. Structural problems are going to be revealed as UK Government support is withdrawn.As they say in America, when the tide goes out you find out whorsquos not wearing a bathing suit.In those circumstances, with unemployment rising, would the First Minister really want to ignite a isive referendum campaign evenshe could  As I say, itrsquos too soon to write off Alba, but one message could be that, while Scots may be increasingly attracted to the concept of independence, they may not be in the market for it right now. Lord make me free, but not yet.Onlyyou are a radical, an insurgent, a risk-taker ndash yes, a gambler ndash does independence really makes sense, at least right now.A politician like Alex Salmond doesnrsquot care about polls or the precautionary principle he makes his own history. Salmond is right that only a mass, popular movement could make the independence cause become unanswerable. It would require big street demonstrations, court actions, civil disobedience. History would need to be placed on fast forward, as it was in Ireland at the start of the last century. Thatrsquos a risky road.Nicola Sturgeon is not arisk-taker, not a revolutionary, and recoils from fighting talk and ision. Itrsquos all too testosterone-fuelled for her. Most middle-class Scots share her risk aversion.One of the abiding themes of Scottish politics over the past  years has been votersrsquo enthusiasm for gradations of home rule that always stop short of actual independence.It might be that Ms Sturgeonrsquos very caution is part of her popularity. She is intensely Scottish, hostile to English Tories, but she can be relied upon not to do anything daft.The independence case is anyway in deep trouble. In , Salmond managed to persuade  per cent of Scots to vote Yes but only after it was made clear that it would not mean a border with England, or losing the pound, or even losing the Queen. Both Scotland and England were assumed to be remaining in the EU. That has all changed.Nicola Sturgeon has avoided discussion of the mechanics of independence post-Brexit, preferring to stick to generalities about how Scots need to take their own decisions and not be under dictation from Brexit Tories.But she knows, and everyone in her Government knows, that the situation is very dferent to . Last weekrsquos report from the Institute for Government underlined in red dficulties that simply canrsquot be ignored.It is true that the act of joining the European Union might only take two to four years ndash the blink of an eye in Brussels terms. But disaggregating the UK would take much longer. Scotland would have to be fully independent of the UK and that would take at least five years going on the Brexit experience.The Institute reckons that wersquod be looking at a decade of complex negotiations before Scotland became a member of the EU.The idea that Brussels might allow some kind of halfway house, letting Scotland join while it was still part of the UK, is a non-starter. It was something the EU refused to consider even before the Northern Ireland Protocol.Recent problems with that mean Brussels will run a mile from Ireland-style anomalies.So there would inevitably be a hard trade border. Scotland may not have to join the euro, at least not immediately, but it will have to be fully independent to fulfil the terms of EU accession.It could not be an independent countryit kept the pound and had monetary policy decided by the Bank of England.Nicola Sturgeon is one of the most gted politicians Scotland has ever produced. She is a trained lawyer and has watched the manold dficulties that followed the Brexit vote.She knows that for independence to succeed it would require a huge level of commitment from the Scottish people ndash a commitment that doesnrsquot as yet exist.Evenshe could secure the essential Section  Order from Westminster, therersquos no guarantee that Yes would win.At best, it might be a ided result, perhaps the inverse of , with a narrow victory for Yes. But that would land her with the nightmare of negotiating independence for a ided nation. The Unionist minority would demand a repeat referendum after the separation agreement with the UK is negotiated. Since that was what Nicola Sturgeon called for on Brexit, it would be hard for her to refuse.All these issues crowd into the mind of a politician like the First Minister.She is too aware of the downside, too conscious of the damage of ision and conflict. That is her great political weakness, but it is also her electoral strength.Her aversion to populism and civil disobedience makes it dficult for her to make history. On the other hand, it may be that Scots are happy for her not to ndash at least for now."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12475872.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-independence-latest-poll-good-news-alba-party-holyrood-elections-approach","story":"The latest poll for the Sunday Times has the newly-formed party Alba just above the threshold required in most of Scotlandrsquos parliamentary regions to pick up a list seat, meaning the party could secure six Holyrood seats.:The Proclaimers throw support behind Alex Salmonds Alba Party with video messageIn the constituency vote, the poll found the SNP had gained two points, up to %, with the Tories dropping one to %, Labour unchanged on % and the Lib Dems down one on %.In the regional list, the SNP have dropped three points to stand at %, with the Conservatives down one to %, Labour down two on %, the Greens on %, Alba on %and Liberals down two points to %.:Nicola Sturgeon condemns shamefully low conviction rate for rape and sexual assaultElsewhere, the George Galloway-led All For Unity partyrsquos support in the list rose to %mdash which Prof Curtice said could give the party a single MSP.Prof Curtice also projected the SNP would win  seats , the Tories  , Labour  , Lib Dems five , Greens eight , Alba six and All for Unity one.However, Professor Sir John Curtice told the Sunday Times thatAlba receives just one point below Panelbasersquos estimate, ldquothe partyrsquos likely tally would be halved to three seats, while at two points lower it could fall to just one.He said: ldquoAlba may be on the cusp of recording a creditable performance and coming away largely empty-handed.A total of , voters were surveyed between March  and April .According to the Panelbase poll, Alex Salmond is considered far less trustworthy than Nicola Sturgeon, with only %of respondents consider him ldquoa fit person to stand for election, while % disagree and %donrsquot know.Alex SalmondOverall, the poll shows Mr Salmond to have an approval rating of -.Meanwhile, the poll showed Nicola Sturgeonrsquos rating is + , with Tory leader Douglas Ross going from ndash to ndash.Green co-leader Patrick Harviersquos rose slightly from ndash to neutral, while Lib Dem chief Willie Renniersquos slipped from ndash to ndash.Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwarrsquos approval rating has leapt from + to + following thefirst televised leadersrsquo debate.The poll also found that independence is backed by % when undecideds are excluded, up % since last month, with % of those surveyed against it .In addition, % of those surveyed said they want another referendum within five years.Writing in the Sunday Times, Sir John said Panelbasersquos results were ldquogood news for the Alba Party.Prof John CurticeThe polling expert said: ldquoAlba may be on the cusp of recording a creditable performance and coming away largely empty-handed.ldquoAlthough most of the seats the party could win with a % tally look as though they would be secured at the expense of the unionist parties, our projection suggests that a couple might otherwise have been won by the SNP or the Greens.ldquoEven with an estimated % of the constituency vote, that is not a possibility the SNP will regard with equanimity.:Nicola Sturgeon praises sacrices made by faith communitiesin Easter messageldquoSuch a result in the constituencies could still leave the party a seat short of an overall majority and reliant on winning a vital list seat to achieve what has come to be regarded as a crucial target.He said that despite Nicola Sturgeonrsquos call for ldquoboth votes SNP, % of those who back the SNP in the constituency vote indicated they would vote Alba on the list and as many as % would opt for the Scottish Greens on the list.He continued: ldquoAlba is appealing to a section of the nationalist movement that wants a rapid timetable for indyref and which still admires Salmond.ldquoAs many as % of Alba supporters want a referendum within  months compared with % of SNP list voters and % of Green voters.ldquoWhile % of those who back Alba believe that Salmond is lsquoa fit person to stand for electionrsquo, only % of SNP supporters and % of Green voters take the same view.ldquoSalmondrsquos personality has enabled him to create a new party out of nothing.ldquoHowever, it may now also constrain what the party can hope to achieve.Alex Salmond welcomed the poll, saying the party was \"gaining ground\".He said: ldquoWe have only just begun to make our case, but ALBA is already registering as the standard bearer of the Independence #Supermajority.ldquoThe reality that voting SNP on the list is the ultimate wasted vote is starting to cut through.

Itrsquos easy, given the SNPrsquos current high point, to forget just how marginal nationalism was  years ago when that little group of students took the stone. But the history of the cause also reveals some familiar patterns: we have been here before.The word Mr Hamilton himself used when I asked him to describe nationalism in the s and s was ldquofringe. In the  election, the SNP attracted . per cent of the vote, andthere were polls on independence, they showed support at % or thereabouts. Indeed, Scottish nationalists were viewed by many as extremists and some of the smaller groups operating on the edges of the movement attracted the interest of Special Branch. By the time we got to the late s, support for home rule looked like it was flatlining.Of course, we know what happened next: Winnie Ewingrsquos victory in the Hamilton by-election in lsquo moved independence away from the fringes and the SNP came to dominate the movement. The party got better organised, it contested more seats, and in the mid-s it claimed that there had been a ten-fold increase in its membership over four years .Anyway, the pattern for nationalism since then has been a series of plateaus as part of a longer climb: at the  election, the SNP won % of the vote then wersquove had the rise and rise since  to the point where the polls now show that ndash even after everything thatrsquos happened to Nicola Sturgeon in the last few months ndash the party will attract pretty much half the vote in the constituencies.Which leaves us with the question of whether the SNPrsquos climb will carry on up, or whether the party ndash not now, not tomorrow but eventually ndash will face a block to their ambitions, which is where the liberator of the Stone of Destiny comes in again. When I asked Mr Hamilton for his views on the election, he said it was obvious it would be success for independence, but it wouldnrsquot make any dference. ldquoWersquore supposed to live in a democracy but we donrsquot, he said, ldquoNo matter how many votes there are, the people who run the United Kingdom will not see us go.Let theatres open, but only when they can be normalSo can he be right  A poll at the weekend predicted success for Alba, giving them six seats, which, together with the SNP, would mean pro-independence parties winning  out of a possible . In other words, Alex Salmond would get the ldquosuper-majority hersquos been talking about and the question then would be whether the UK Government ndash even a government thatrsquos said ldquono as many times as Boris Johnsonrsquos has ndash could carry on refusing.Mr Hamilton clearly thinks it could because, in his view, the people who run the UK ldquowill not see us go. But could they do that without solid grounds, andso, what could the grounds be  Perhaps someone will make the point thatthe pro-independence parties do win  seats, they will have  per cent of the seats for a cause that attracts only fortysomething per cent support from voters, and that would be a very good point to make. You might even say Scotland did not get the parliament it voted for and the UK Government might say that the ldquosuper-majority is no such thing.But a second look at the ebbs and flows of the nationalist cause since Mr Hamilton and his comrades removed the stone reveals another repeating pattern. Bit by bit over the last few months, wersquove seen the relationship between Sturgeon and Salmond move from veiled criticism to open criticism to a scratchy trench-war and part of it centres on a tactical ision: Ms Sturgeon wants to take it easy and build broad support, whereas Mr Salmond wants to push harder, using ldquopeaceful street demonstrations or starting negotiations for independence regardless. Mr Salmond, the great risk-taker, is the bull in the china shop, whereas Ms Sturgeon, by far the better tactician, knows people are going to worry about all the china thatrsquos getting smashed.The point is that this ision between what you might call the moderates and the passionates has always been an issue for the SNP. Famously, in , a small group splintered away from the party because of their concern that the SNP was doing nothing but talk. The party leadership on the other hand urged moderation and warned that the behaviour of a minority in the movement was putting voters off. Pretty much, this is the conversation thatrsquos still going on  years later with Alba.What on earth does the last few days mean for the unionist cause And ndash then and now ndash there have always been people in the nationalist movement who have warned that independence will be a long, long time coming and that there will be many  victories. Bruce Watson, leader of the SNP in the s, told his small annual conference in  that the road to a Scottish Parliament would be a series of ldquopromises, assurances, safeguards, and sometimes cynical rebuffs and thatrsquos pretty much what Mr Hamilton is saying all these years later: he predicts a victory but also a cynical rebuff.Perhaps, then, it is this that should be the lesson of the history of the SNP and the wider movement. There have always been victories and set-backs. There have always been isions. There have always been rebuffs or rejections. Obviously, in , the SNP is considerably closer to its aim than it was when the Stone of Destiny was taken from Westminster Abbey in , but Mr Hamilton still believes the cause will be rebuffed again. What history tells us is that hersquos probably right.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I think Brexit still has a big part to play.She added: ldquoIf I could change things so we never had had Covid and that meant support for independence wasnrsquot quite as high as it was, I would trade any day.ldquoBut people have, at a time of crisis, looked to their own government here in Scotland to lead, and they wonrsquot have agreed with every decision we have taken at times, but at a time of crisis, I think what we have seen is that natural inclination of people to look to their own democratically elected government.ldquoAnd perhaps that has made people think about the benefit of self-government, and it may well be that that is having some kind of impact in the polls.The First Minister said that ldquoindependence has never enjoyed the kind of reasonably long term, sustained, majority support it has in recent times.And while she said there would be ldquofluctuations in that, I am sure she added that the ldquobaseline appears to be higher than it has been at any time ever.Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross said it was \"jarring to see Nicola Sturgeon use the pandemic as a recruiting tool for independence\".Scottish Tory leader Douglas RossHe added: \"Itrsquos even more galling when the truth is that she didnrsquot handle this pandemic any better than others.

These old-growth forests are especially valuable given that they take a century or more to recover following disturbance.Three years ago, Cadburys former head of cocoa sourcing said that wild cocoa ietyies untapped by chocolate makers are in danger of beign wiped out.Tony Lass, director of Fox Consultancy, and head of Cadburys global cocoa supplies from  to  said cocoas genetic ersity - key for creating disease and climate resistant crops with storng chocolate flavour - was at risk of disappearing.Over the last  years, some wild cocoa iety have been saved through national and international collecting expeditions for example by the Cocoa Research Centerin Trinidad."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12476852.jpg?type=article-full","title":"forest-learning-hub-aims-nurture-edinburgh-pupils","story":"Fire pits, camping and ldquoforest bathing are all likely to be on the timetable at a pioneering new learning hub that is set to become reality after receiving planning consent.In what promises to be a signicant expansion, the centre will allow Harmeny Education Trustrsquos grant-aided special school in Balerno, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, to accommodate children and young people past the age of .The Trust provides residential support and teaching to youngsters who have experienced neglect and abuse, or had such traumatic family lives that they needed to be placed in care from an early age.:Scottish councils lsquoavoidrsquo legal plans for additional needs pupilsSituated in  acres of woodland, its new building will offer vocational classrooms, art spaces and a bike workshop, as well as multi-al internal and external areas.Nearly pound. million of the pound.m funding target has already been raised and it is hoped work on the project, which has been led by Loader Monteith and SJM Architects, will be complete in summer .

If you do see someone in dficulty in the water or at the coast call  and ask for the Coastguard.”Speaking on behalf of Kirkwall leboat, Graham Campbell said: “We understand that many people will have been missing trips to the coast and will be eager for a change of scene or activity.#However, we are really asking the public for their help.  Our team of dedicated volunteers have remained on call throughout the pandemic but, in order to attend a shout, we must break physical distancing instructions, putting ourselves and our families at risk.#We also cannot be everywhere at once,we see a sudden increase in people visiting the coast and local beaches our volunteer run service could struggle to meet demand.

prepare for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions.The lateral flow tests ndash which can provide results in around  minutes ndash will be available from Friday, regardless of whether people have symptoms.The announcement comes as Boris Johnson is due to meet senior ministers on Monday to sign off the next stage of the road map out of lockdown. vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Johnson will set out the arrangements for the next phase of lting lockdown People will be able to obtain a test through a home ordering service, workplace or school testing programme, or by collecting one at a local test site.The Prime Minister said the scheme would help stop fresh outbreaks, enabling the authorities to identy and control new iants of the disease.ldquoAs we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our road map cautiously easing restrictions under way, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted, he said.ldquoThatrsquos why wersquore now rolling out free rapid tests to everyone across England ndash helping us to stop outbreaks in their tracks, so we can get back to seeing the people we love and doing the things we enjoy.Mr Johnson will chair a virtual meeting of the Covid O committee before briefing the full Cabinet on the arrangements for the latest phase of lockdown lting which will see non-essential shops in England reopen from April .He will then set out the details at a Downing Street news conference where he is expected to say more about plans announced at the weekend for Covid certicates for mass gatherings from sporting events to nightclubs. vw,vw,px, px\"He will also outline the Governmentrsquos approach for lting restrictions on holidays abroad starting from May .Under the Governmentrsquos road map, pubs and restaurants will be able to start serving customers outdoors from next week while hairdressers, nail salons, gyms and libraries ndash as well as non-essential retail ndash will be able to reopen.While there is relief among MPs at the prospect of the economy reopening, there is concern among some about the proposals for the ldquoCovid status certication scheme dubbed ldquovaccine passports.Ministers insist the certicates ndash which could be a mobile phone app or a paper document ndash will never be required for essential services such as supermarkets, public transport or GP surgeries.Initially, at least, they will also not be necessary to go to pubs or restaurants as they begin serving again.Ministers believe the scheme will be most useful in managing the risks where there are large numbers of people in close proximity such as music festivals, sporting matches and nightclubs.However more than  Tory MPs have signed a cross-party letter opposing vaccine passports while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has described them as ldquoun-British, raising the prospect of a potential Government defeatndash as expected ndash there is a Commons vote.Writing in The Daily , Sir Graham Brady, the influential chairman of the backbench Tory  Committee, said vaccine passports were ldquointrusive, costly and unnecessary.Under the plans set out at the weekend the

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Of the , tonnes of recycling collected by the roadside, around % was rejected and sent for energy recovery, ie incineration.The figures were released by Environment Minister Edwin Poots after an Assembly question from Alliance#s John Blair.It follows a Channel  Dispatches programme that revealed some councils in the UK recycle less than % of the waste householders put out in bins.Mr Blair said he is concerned about the environmental impact of incinerating recyclable material. Carbon emissions are a prime driver of climate change, which is why there has been a move away from coal-fired energy. However, more energy-generating incinerators has meant they are steadily producing more C. In fact, in  emissions from the UK#s incinerators overtook those from coal, he said.More can be done to stop recyclable materials being incinerated. Valuable resources such as plastic should remain in the circular economy and not sent for incineration.Belfast Green Party councillor Bryan Smyth said: It#s disappointing that this level of recycling ends up incinerated. Manufacturers must produce less packaging, and packaging that is easier to recycle. Likewise, the scourge of single use plastics must be dealt with by government at all levels. Our citizens have bought into recycling and many people across Northern Ireland do their inidual bit and take the time to separate their household waste. As public representatives, we need to put in place the systems that match their efforts.Mr Poots said the % figure is signicantly lower than other parts of the UK, and my department is working closely with councils and delivery partners to improve this further.In addition, councils are well aware of the benefits of reusing and recycling our resources over and above incineration or landfill, he added.I am continually striving to ensure that more action is taken to address consistency in collections and contamination within recycling streams. In order to improve the quality and quantity of our recycling and thereby enabling a transition to a low carbon, circular economy, I believe it is important that dficult or non-recyclable items are removed from recycling streams before they are collected.He said his department is addressing this by working to improve packaging, a better consistency of items collected, and encouraging the public to have a better understanding of what can be recycled.It comes after it emerged DUP MPs signed a letter in support of the controversial Arc incinerator near Mallusk in Co Antrim, despite the party#s representatives previously voicing their opposition to the scheme.In a letter to Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon, the DUP#s eight MPs said the incinerator was a vital strategic project for the successful delivery of Northern Ireland#s future waste management strategy and the immense private sector investmentin the post-Covid recovery phase period must be welcomed.Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken described the move as an extraordinary U-turn by the party.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We did as many touristy things as we could.Ms Haigh#s most recent visit could not have been more dferent - as the new Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.Then, social distancing rather than socialising was the order of the day, as the Labour MP met, among others, Troubles victims and survivors at the Wave Trauma Centre in Belfast.There, the people who welcomed her included the centre#s coordinator Alan McBride, whose we Sharon died in the  Shankill bombing, and Jenner McNern, a survivor of the  Abercorn Bar atrocity.Louise spent time listening and learning but, frustratingly for her, she hasn#t been in close contact with anyone locally-based since that day last July.Consequently, she is looking forward to the end of lockdown - and finally meeting the likes of First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill in person, rather than on Zoom.I have regular virtual meetings with both Arlene and Michelle, both of whom I respect enormously, but I couldn#t tell you how tall either of them are, she joked.Attempting to do her job remotely has, however, been no laughing matter for singleton Louise, whose maternal grandmother hails from Cork.Of her Westminster colleagues from here, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is a good friend and she gets on very well with the DUP#s parliamentary leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, but obviously there hasn#t been so much personal interaction with Stormont politicians.It#s actually been incredibly frustrating holding this brief during lockdown, said the Yorkshire woman, who lives alone in her native Sheffield - except for her dog Milo - but shares a property in London with an MP colleague and a couple of other friends in what she calls a strange split le.In the first lockdown I had my best friend and her seven-year-old living with me but since they moved out, I#ve been on my own, she said.This last lockdown has been the most dficult because the weather#s been horrendous and it#s felt almost interminable.Describing herself as a very sociable person, she said she has really missed my family and friends.Some assumptions frustrated me when we went into lockdown, she added.People were assuming Members of Parliament were inflicting rules on everyone  because we were with our families and protected that way, but lockdown has been really dficult for those of us who live alone.She hasn#t ventured near a travel agent just yet but is hoping to visit a good friend in Cornwall soon and more importantly, get over to Northern Ireland in the next couple of weeks.Louise, who became the youngest Labour MP when she was elected as member for Sheffield Heeley in , is also the first female Northern Ireland Shadow Secretary since the late Marjorie #Mo# Mowlam - one of my political heroes - in the s.Mo was unlike any SoS or shadow SoS who had come before, said Louise of her predecessor, a key architect of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement who, tragically, died in , aged just .She had loads of personality and although she took the brief very seriously, she didn#t take people very seriously.It#s people that really drive me, in the way that motivated and inspired Mo as well.There are too many politicians who aren#t motivated by people, and don#t feel comfortable being around people.They feel more comfortable in locked offices thinking about policy rather than being driven by the challenges people face in their everyday lives.Louise, who studied politics at the University of Nottingham, initially toyed with a career in criminal law - she did a Masters degree in Law after her politics degree - like her father Richard . Mum Juanita , is a probate solicitor, and her brother Philis a sports journalist.Politics, however, ran through the family.My uncle was a striking coal miner in the s, while my auntie moved to South Africa and worked for the international Red Cross, fighting against apartheid in the s and s, she said.My grandma also fled from the Spanish civil war in the early th century.I had a very left-wing economics teacher at school who made me see where my views fitted into a party political framework, and that#s why I joined Labour when I was .Louise#s first job after graduation was working for MP Graham Allen and that totally opened my eyes to a whole world that I#d never known before.Being an MP herself - she is still one of the youngest people on the famous green benches of the Commons - still daunts Louise.I look around when I#m in there and think #what am I doing here , she admitted.I still have massive imposter syndrome you can#t help think of all the incredible people who#ve gone before you. But it#s been an extraordinary learning curve over the last six years.Despite the self-effacement, Ms Haigh is regarded as one of the most talented and astute Labour MPs, which is one of the reasons why she is in Sir Keir Starmer#s shadow cabinet.It is her job to keep her Conservative opposite number, Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, on his toes, and has done so on many occasions from the dispatch box.But she backs Mr Lewis#s attempts to override the devolved government here and push through abortion legislation, which was passed in  when the Stormont Executive was suspended but has yet to be officially implemented.It#s a great shame that it#s come to this, she said.Ultimately the UK government has human rights obligations, and the situation in Northern Ireland was found to be in breach of those obligations.Women are still facing the completely unacceptable situation of having to travel to access safe legal abortion so, as regrettable as it is, I support the government in what they#re doing.It is a dferent story, however, when it comes to that other major bone of contention, the Northern Ireland Protocol.Last month the UK moved to unilaterally extend the grace periods for Irish Sea border checks - which the European Union regards as a breach of international law.With Northern Ireland remaining a part of the EU#s single market post-Brexit, and goods and products arriving here from GB having to undergo EU import procedures, the initial grace period was meant to end on March . Mr Lewis and his cabinet colleagues decided otherwise.Theyhave repeatedly put their narrow political interests above the interests of Northern Ireland and we#re seeing the consequences of that play out now, she said.Northern Ireland is not a priority for them like it was for the last Labour government, and the Tories# recklessness and political games, particularly with the Good Friday Agreement, are resulting in the threat of instability now.She added: Labour knew how potentially upsetting Brexit could be to the delicate balance of identities in Northern Ireland.I totally accept what a challenge this is to unionism and loyalism and to their identity and there wasn#t nearly enough consideration given to what their reaction would be. Even in January, Brandon Lewis was still denying there was any Irish Sea border - and that dishonesty has worsened the anger and made things a lot more dficult to repair.Ms Haigh#s former party leader Jeremy Corbyn made no secret of his support for a united Ireland, so where does she stand I don#t think it#s a forgone conclusion, she said.The constitutional question will, however, come up over coming years but there are still a signicant number of people who have to be persuaded of the merits of a united Ireland.For me, the most important thing is making Northern Ireland work for the people there. As Mo Mowlam said, it#s the real lives of people that needs changing and there are huge public policy issues that need addressing right now, from the health service and mental health service to legacy issues.If the current opinion polls are anything to go by, Louise won#t get an opportunity to emulate Mo Mowlam and become a Labour #SoS# here.Despite the many mistakes made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his colleagues since the Covid- pandemic struck, the Tories - who have a huge parliamentary majority - remain comfortably ahead of the main opposition party.And Mr Starmer, who has just passed one year as Labour leader, is facing criticism from many of his own backbenchers who accuse him of sitting on the fence too often and abstaining, rather than voting against, the Government on key issues such as the Covid restrictions tier system.I#m desperate to hold onto it until the next election at the very least, said Louise, who conceded that the #vaccine bounce# has helped the Conservatives enormously over the past few months.The government has made enormous mistakes and had massive failures - the highest death rate in Europe and the worst economic impact of any developed economy in the world, she said.They have failed on every metric, but they are enjoying the success of the vaccine.The battle for the next election, however, is going to be about recovery and rebuilding our country. The Tories are the government that weakened our economy and our public services so drastically ahead of the coronavirus and that#s why we had such a disastrous response to it.Ironically, Ms Haigh has personally been helping the NHS vaccination programme her rivals are claiming credit for.A GP askedI would come down and help at one of the local vaccination centres, she explained.They were giving out the Pfizer vaccine to a lot of older people so I was helping them with mobility issues.A lot of them were getting their second vaccine and crying out #freedom#. It was so positive.Despite the criticism of Ms Haigh#s boss, he has acted decisively to rid Labour of the accusations of anti-Semitism which blighted the Corbyn era.Louise admitted the party still had work to do in rebuilding trust with the Jewish community but have already made enormous strides with that.Ithas been a real stain on our party and one I#m deeply ashamed of, she said.On a lighter note, is it true that the Mark Darcy character played by Colin Firth in the Brigid Jones#s Diary series is based on the Labour leader Confirming that author Helen Fielding later denied that, Louise added: I had a massive crush on Colin Firth... I#m afraid I don#t have a crush on Keir Starmer.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s a time of year that signals a new beginning, and we hope and pray that this is a step towards better times ahead.It was a very signicant and special day for us all, but we will remain cautious, he said.It was lovely to see faces again, an uplting and hopeful day for the church community and another small step towards all our hopes being fulfilled.It has been a dficult time, but we have managed to survive and even thrive by staying close together through online services, telephone calls and across social media.But nothing beats the feeling of togetherness when you#re together.Face masks were worn by all, no-one hung around at the end. Everyone appreciated how special the day was to be as one again in the same physical space. It was a day filled with hope.At St Patrick#s Cathedral in Armagh, the leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, welcomed both a physical and virtual congregation and told the congregation that he was conscious this year of the victims of the Covid crisis, including those who are finding it more and more dficult to cope with lockdown: the lonely and bereaved those who are unable to see or embrace loved ones those for whom the last year has brought increased financial or business worries those whose relationships have been under great pressure those who have found their addictions hard to manage.Earlier, the Archbishop had expressed concern that law makers in the Republic had neglected the spiritual wellbeing of the community during the pandemic, with only churches in Northern Ireland being permitted to allow public services over Easter weekend.It#s a really dficult balancing act but we would have really hoped to have some opportunity to gather in cautious, small numbers for Holy Week and Easter, as we#re doing in Northern Ireland, he said.We#re really hoping for the day when across the whole island people can gather to worship safely.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Brides and grooms-to-be are now looking to move ahead with wedding plans despite the inability of bridal boutiques and jewellers to fully reopen due to coronavirus restrictions. Rebecca Bryson, the owner of Curvy Chic Bridal in Belfast, is addressing the problem by offering virtual appointments, at-home try-on services and sale dresses on her website. It#s not the exact same experience but we try to make it as nice as possible, she said.It is a similar situation with other retailers.Jewellery designer Mairi Burrow is also offering an at-home wedding ring service for couples getting married. Couples contact her via her website to organise a Zoom consultation and are sent one of five ring boxes with ring sizers, D printed nylon ring samples, magnying tweezers and archive books to go through, along with a price list. I#ve had very positive feedback so far and the Zoom consultation helps solidy any query, Mairi said. It#s admin-intensive organising for the box to be posted out and for everything to be sanitised - before, I would just see people on Saturday. Now we have to organise Zooms and post the box and everything that goes along with it.Try before you buy is essential when making a jewellery purchase, Mairi said. She added: You need to try on widths and thicknesses with your engagement ring so it#s not something you can blindly buy. Seeing the nylon sample on your hand is crucial to making your decision.Wedding ring orders can be fulfilled quickly but she advised couples not to leave it until the last minute.I usually take people with a -week turnaround time. Plain bands can be quite quick but you need to factor that you will receive it a few weeks before your wedding, Mairi added. I#ve had a few people who thought they could hold off until we meet in person but nobody knows when that will be. There#s so much uncertainty there but I have clients in Scotland and London for whom the ring box is a bonus. Now it can be sent throughout the whole of the UK and Ireland. Rebecca Bryson said that for her appointments, she goes by wedding date when deciding which brides to prioritise. The people who are under the most pressure are getting their appointments first, she said. The people who are in the summer months and feeling very stressed have the at-home service where they can try on five dresses after a Zoom call where we narrow down some choices. We also send a tape measure and clamps.The service, which is being offered across Northern Ireland, is also helping to offload dress stocks which had built up over the course of the pandemic. People are able to get a dress in a short time-frame, she explained. Rebecca said she has found the lack of information on restrictions exhausting. She added: Brides will message us and ask do we know when we#re reopening. We get our information from the news and there#s no insider info. Every time the dates have moved we#ve been rescheduling brides who are starting to panic.There are people who are getting married in November or December and have now realised they have less time than they thought.It is recommended that her brides pick a dress around  months before their wedding - but a series of factors have caused issues. Rebecca explained: There are delays in shipping, partly due to Covid and now because of Brexit. The shipping aspect is taking longer than it used to for things coming from outside the UK. What would normally have taken days is taking weeks. We#re fortunate that our designers are ready to go and know they need to hit the ground running and get dresses out as fast as they can. The most urgent cases come via brides who had planned to wait to choose a dress when shops reopened and now need to find something in time for the summer. We just see what we can do with the at-home service. We#ve put a lot of dresses in our online sale that are brand new and that we have to release because people don#t have time, she said. Rebecca sought to reassure brides-to-be, advising them: Don#t panic.She added: I think a lot of brides coming to us at the end of the year and the start of next year are starting to wonder will they be able to get a dress. We are prepared for this and it#s not our first rodeo after last year. Elody in Newry, Petticoat Lane in Hillsborough and La Boda Bridal in Banbridge are also offering try-at-home so you can chat to them about what you want - evenyou try something on, it can help put your mind at ease.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two men helped plan and lead an IRA escape from the Maze Prison in the s. He is highly unlikely to apologise publicly for being at the funeral.The North Belfast MLA represents the older guard of the party. It is his job to keep the republican base on board, leaving the diplomacy in times of crisis to the newer wing of Sinn Fein.The party is in a tricky position, balancing the anger of those who sacriced family funerals because of the Covid restrictions with not being seen to be subservient to the demands of the DUP.Ahead of the Easter break, when republicans commemorate their dead, sackcloth and ashes apologies will not play out well with their base.What does this mean for the DUP, which needs to be seen as tough on Sinn Fein or face further criticism from Jim Allister, who has the party chasing him around for the working-class loyalist vote Mr Allister said earlier this week that all unionist politicians should walk away from the Policing Board in protest at the decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to attendance at the funeral. Not so long ago, this would have been viewed as a radical suggestion, but his calls appear to be gaining traction with DUP Junior Minister Gordon Lyons, who told the BBC the party was considering its position on the oversight body.Walking away from public bodies may make a statement in the short term, but where does that leave unionism#s long-term strategy going forward,those whose resignations it has called for simply choose to ride out the storm The criticism of the Chief Constable, allegations of two-tier policing and questioning the motivation of the PSNI at a time of loyalist unrest is a very dangerous game for the DUP to be playing.With tensions around the sea border and loyalists in some areas withdrawing cooperation with police on community bodies, any ramping up of tensions could be used as cover by those hell-bent on taking opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol onto the streets.The announcement by the PPS on Wednesday that the decision on the Storey funeral was to be reviewed by independent counsel may well buy some time for unionists to revise their strategy.Meanwhile, on what should have been a quiet holiday week, the Executive is facing yet another political crisis, leaving many askingthe devolved government is fit for purpose.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey PlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The images from across Northern Ireland today instead are of property destroyed, lives endangered. Stop this now, before lives are lost.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseWeekend of violence: Police came under attack in Belfast and NewtownabbeyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueWeekend of violence: Police came under attack in Belfast and NewtownabbeyNorth Area Commander Chief Superintendent Davy Beck said Saturday night#s riot lasted for around three hours from .pm and involved a crowd of approximately  to  people consisting of young people and older men.Throughout the evening local councillors worked very closely with police in an effort to dfuse the situation, he said.This was an orchestrated attack on police who were carrying out their duties to help protect the people of Newtownabbey.My officers put on their unorm every day and go out into the community they serve, not knowing what lies ahead of them.However this does not deter them from turning up every day to do their duty. No-one, no matter what line of work they are in, deserves to be subjected to any kind of violence.The officers who serve the Newtownabbey area are fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters, they have families who wait every day on their loved ones coming home, hoping they have not been injured, or worse.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseWeekend of violence: Police came under attack in Belfast and NewtownabbeyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueWeekend of violence: Police came under attack in Belfast and NewtownabbeyChief Supt Beck added that no one needs the added pressure of disorder in their community, especially as the Covid- pandemic continues.Everyone deserves to live in peace, free from violence, he said.I would appeal to those who are taking to the streets to stop immediately, their actions are causing nothing but harm and distress to the very communities they claim they are representing.The people of Northern Ireland deserve better. No-one wants to be dragged back to the dark days when rioting was a common occurrence on the streets of Northern Ireland.Yesterday the DUP#s Gregory Campbell called for calm and for attacks on the police to stop. Rioting and injuring rank and file officers will only result in young people being criminalised, he said.The East Londonderry MP also criticised Sinn Fein MLA Gerry Kelly for comments on Saturday about the disorder. Mr Kelly claimed the disturbances were a direct consequence of the actions of political unionism and accused DUP rhetoric of sending a very dangerous message to young people in loyalist areas. Tensions are running high within loyalism over post-Brexit trading arrangements which some see as creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Anger ramped up further last week following a controversial decision not to prosecute  Sinn Fein politicians for attending the Bobby Storey funeral during Covid- restrictions. Unionist parties have demanded the resignation of PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne, claiming he has lost the confidence of their community. Mr Campbell accused Mr Kelly and Sinn Fein of arrogance and not recognising the major part they played in creating anger in the community. Sinn Fein helped organise an IRA man#s funeral where , people attended when other people couldn#t even have some of their own children at the funeral of a loved one, he said. Gerry Kelly and co need to get real. People aren#t taps that some politician can turn on or off.Yesterday the PSNI announced that a -year-old man has been charged in connection with rioting, and throwing a petrol bomb in Newtownabbey. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday, April .Meanwhile seven people have been charged after the disturbances in the Sandy Row area.Four adults - three men aged ,  and , and a woman aged  - have been charged with riot.All four are due to appear at Belfast Magistrates Court on April .Three teenagers, aged ,  and , have also been charged with riot and are due to appear at Belfast Youth Court on April .Fteen PSNI officers were injured during the rioting in Sandy Row on Friday night. Petrol bombs, bricks and fireworks were thrown at police lines with up to  people involved in the disturbances, which followed a protest advertised on social media earlier in the day.First Minister Arlene Foster warned young people not to get drawn into disorder, an appeal echoed by Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, who said the violence was completely unacceptable.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailStormont defends #routine use# of temporary promotions to plug staffing gaps at DfILatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Of this figure,  promotions were in place for less than six months,  for six to  months and  for  months and over.Over the past five years, a total of  temporary promotions occurred within the department.Alliance infrastructure spokesperson Andrew Muir said DfI has been struggling with staffing shortages for years.The Public Accounts Committee, of which I am a member, is currently considering a report into the capacity and capability of the civil service, he said.The issues identied by that report clearly apply to the Department for Infrastructure, especially the need for overall and Departmental Workforce Plans to ensure public services properly delivered by properly and permanently staffed departments.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseUlster Unionist MLA Roy Beggs FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueUlster Unionist MLA Roy BeggsTemporary promotions and use of agency staff are rightly cited in recent Audit Office report as reflective of need for transformational change.Ulster Unionist infrastructure spokesperson Roy Beggs said: There has been a marked increase in the numbers of staff who have been temporarily acting up over the past year, which is concerning. An increased number of staff in temporary positions is not good practice as some may not have the necessary training and experience. It may be because of an increased number of staff being unable to work as a result of Covid and,that is the case, I would hope that with the increased protections now available from vaccines and the end of shielding, that permanent staff will be increasingly back in position once more. I will be seeking an explanation for the increase from the Minister.A DfI spokesperson said: Temporary promotions are routinely used across NI Civil Service departments as cover for vacant posts where there is a clear business need and no immediate alternative available and DfI, which employs around , staff, is no dferent in that regard. Temporary promotions are, as their name suggests, temporary arrangements which are only intended to be in place until a permanent appointment can be made.Across the civil service, millions of pounds have been spent on agency workers to cover staffing gaps. In November , it emerged that spending on agency staff increased by % in three years.An Audit Office report found that expenditure on agency staff is now running at more than £m each year, while overtime costs have also risen by .%, totalling £.m in the  months to April . The report concluded that the civil service must change how it plans, recruits, manages and develops its workforce to deliver value for money.As of March , around , people were employed by the nine ministerial departments and their executive agencies, making it the third largest workforce in Northern Ireland.Between  and , however, substantial restructuring and rationalisation led to almost , staff leaving, with the majority through a voluntary exit scheme.Belfast Most Read#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementMy revenge porn hell: Belfast mum tried to take her own le after ex-fiance posted nude images on social mediaNew IRA chief Thomas Mellon insists on bogside #show of unity# Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI driver in #drunken# US horror smashTop VideosPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second night\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news d .ece AUTOCROP wh faefedb.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayPetrol bombs thrown during disturbances in Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey PlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in NewtownabbeyLatest Northern IrelandGive blood in memory of my son, says leukaemia victim#s motherFirst-time buyers £ a year better off than renters in Northern IrelandBelfast City Hall#s anti-sexual harassment policy hailedBright start: but Arctic winds to blast Northern Ireland with snow and hailLatest from Belfast Mary KennyOpinionPilgrimage is a journey of personal discoveryThis is how stress can affect your complexion: Experts advise on how to copepandemic worries have had an impact on your skinBrian McGilloway: #We tend to have our detectives overcome every battle… but some you just can#t win#Armstrong Medical#s sales show healthy rise during Covid pandemicCheers: Russian consumers have a thirst for NI whiskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wesley was born and reared in  Demesne, that terrace of houses overlooking what we still refer to as the “ New Road”, a terrace built a dozen years or so before the Londonderry Corporation initiated the post war creation of the Creggan Estate. Tragically, Wesley passed away alone at his home around January th. My next door neighbourBrian Martin answered a concerned call from Wesley’s son, Andrew, on January th by popping in to seeWesley was ok only to find that he had passed away-- a major shock for Brian and for us all in Demesne. googletag.cmd.push In some ways, Wesley was a larger than le, colourful character. In his early eighties and in spite of the pressures brought by Covid, Wesley still very much enjoyed a thread of conversation and a bit of craic. Before Covid, many’s a morning I’d see him heading down the green slope in front of Demesne to catch the Creggan bus into town. He’d shop a little at TESCO’s, walk over to the Central Library, linger a while there chatting with the regulars, then catch the Creggan bus back up to Demesne enjoying the roundabout route the bus would take, a roundabout that enabled further chat and craic. googletag.cmd.push Other mornings he ‘d head down to William Street Baths for a swim and a chat Simple but precious and le-giving routinesCovid inevitably restricted Wesley’s social le about the town but he rarely grumbled. “How you doing, Wesley ” “Never better” he might reply. Wesley was “separated” from his we of many years, Jean but that word “separated” can mean dferent things in dferent families. Wesley still referred to Jean as “the we”. They certainly remained friends, talked together on the phone and frequently holidayed together. On the morning of the funeral, beautully managed by Adair and Neely’s, a grieving Jean requested that the cortege drive from the Foyle Road up to Demesne and pause in front of the Colhoun family home.     The neighbours who had known Wesley for so many years more than myself came out onto the street to salute Wesley one last time and say a silent prayer. This was a touching, dignied and generous moment. When I first moved to Demesne in , Wesley was to the fore in making me feel welcome. He offered to fix the creaking gate in front of my house. That neighbourly act was typical of him and was the start of our friendship. In , his mother Ethel was still alive though elderly and in need of constant care. Wesley provided that daily care until Ethel passed away in . Caring was part of Wesley’s make-up. For years he had been a psychiatric nurse, first in Gransha and later in Scotland to where he and Jean had emigrated during the ’s. Together they raised four sons: Geoffrey, Andrew, Stephen and Greg. In , as part of the th anniversary celebrations of the Holy Child PS Wesley volunteered to come into the school and talk to the youngsters about growing up in Creggan before the estate was built, before there was a Holy Child’s School or a St Mary’s chapel. The children struggled some to imagine those wide open spaces that Wesley conjured up when he was a child in the late ’s and early ’s. One more recent night in Sandino’s, in the company of myself, singer-songwriter, Roy Arbuckle and our English friend Andy, he protested to the deejay about his choice of music, asking for a few dance tunes that were more “his era.” Of course we “slagged” him plenty about this. Now we have only the gt of that memory. Last Christmas morning, stood in our respective backyards, he and I had a socially distanced celebratory glass of whiskey, Jameson’s of course, and a wee mince pie and then on New Years Day, we had another glass of Jameson’s together. I did not know then that this would be our last drink together this side of the grave. Brian, Nicola and Sean had Wesley in with them for Christmas dinner in  Demesne. As we say here, he was “in good form.” Wesley was buried on Thursday th January in Altnagelvin Cemetery, Waterside. He wanted neither minister nor priest but he loved the psalm “The Lord is my shepherd” and had requested that one of his sons read that psalm by his graveside where he is now buried with Ethel and his father, Billy: “TheLordis my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters.” Wesley may you rest in peace. I still keep looking around expecting to see you, maybe out in your backyard re-filling your bird feed or heading down to your allotment, your “secret garden” from where you sometimes fetched rhubarb or daffodils for us your neighbours.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just four weeks after manager Neil Lennons resignation, skipper Scott Brown heads for the Parkhead exit door. Whoever comes in as boss must find a new on-field general. In a -year spell, Brown played over  games for the Glasgow giants, won  league titles and a dozen domestic cups. More than that, he was their heartbeat. Celtic legend Scott Brown.  The road to success is a rocky one and any team navigating such a path needs, among other things, a tough underbelly. Silky skills, lucky. craft, tactics and enough magical players to turn games on their head, any team looking to win trophies need them. But they need leaders too. Without a spine, everything  can horribly fall apart. googletag.cmd.push Having a manager the players believe in and are inspired by is an important ingredient. When the game begins, bar some cajoling from the sideline or a vital switch, the players have to deliver. Thats irrelevantyou dont have a group of players who will commit to the cause. The team with the most leaders, more often than not, will be left standing when the rest have fallen. By a leader, it isnt always the actual captain, though it is important to select well. Managers will suss out their squad. Who wont be under pressure to retain their place  Who wont go AWOL in mid-season  Who will the players follow into battle  googletag.cmd.push It wont necessarily be the person who delivers the killer speech, but someone who would put their head where others wouldnt put a shovel. Or someone who, when the chips are down, who will want the ball. One point up, one point down or staring at a hammering straight in the face. There will be a maverick in the equation, but depending on how unpredictable they are, its unlikely theyll wear the captains armband. This time last year, Netflix unfurled The Last Dance on us and a Chicago Bulls team that included Dennis Rodman. He was colourful in every way. From his fancy hairdos to his fashion and party lestyle. Youd never make him captain, but put him into the white heat of a ball game, he always delivered.     When they dont meet the manager half-way, it is time to cut them loose. But, again,the chemistry is right in the team and a desire to succeed, everyone  will pull them into line. The mavericks way of leading would be to slam the ball in the back of the net to turn a game on its head. Its just a pity Derry werent able to fully manage Eoin Skinner Bradley and channel all he had to offer. That type of magic to strike fear into teams. Every team has an assortment of dferent characters, fusing them altogether is the secret. Like Phil Jackson did with Rodman. Its not easy balancing everything, butit was everyone would be doing it. On the outskirts of any accommodation of a Skinner or a Rodman, there is the core of a team. The leaders that will define it. God rest my primary school teacher Maire Trolan – a real lady – I always remember her telling us about empty vessels making the most sound. The same can be said of a player. Those spoofing around a changing room, buttheir team isnt in control are nowhere to be seen. These types of iniduals are ten a penny. In the games melting pot where tackles need made and breaking balls are there to be hoovered up. A  metre run, despite being second favourite to win possession. Those who deliver in such cases, when the pressure is on, are what I call a championship player. When I think of the scenario, Patsy Bradley comes into my mind. Risking le and limb for the good of the team. He might never say much, but would never ask someone to do what he is not prepared to do himself. And with that comes a respect. Cast the mind back to the Ballinderry team who dominated the senior championship, with seven titles in  years. They are currently in transition, with some of their young guns lighting up the championship last season. Patsy Bradley closes in on Kevin McGuckin  Think of what they lost. Two of the greatest they ever produced, Enda Muldoon and Conleith Gilligan, hung up their boots around the same time. Mickey C Conlan departed the scene, with Kevin McGuckin – their last link with the  All-Ireland team - retiring over the winter . You dont find that type of collective class and experience in a lucky bag. Thats where underage coaching needs to take an important focus in allowing an environment for leaders to blossom. Teaching the skills is of paramount importance, to instil the correct habits from early on. After that, players can begin to play at a faster pace and in games under contact. As well as promoting a use of both sides, coaches need to allow players to take a lead in games. And to openly encourage it. Chatting to Philip Kerr a few weeks back, he was outlining Derrys Games Development Committees focus on getting coaches to observe and let their players...well, just let them play. It promotes communication and an onus to work things out. At the end of the day, when gardens, streets and back fields were a hive of activity and a flurry of games, there were no coaches or referees. It was survival of the fittest and fastest. Philip pointed to the concern of one dominant player being allowed to dictate to his quieter team mates on how the practice games would be played. This type of scenario needs to be managed. Everyone needs the chance to grow as a player and a decision maker. Players managed under a barrage of instruction wont need to think for themselves. When your team is a point down and the fourth official signals two minutes of added time, thats when championships are won and lost. Thats the time for fire in the belly, but an ice-cool persona. For someone youd trust with your bottom dollar. If your team is littered with such players, chances are youll eke out an equaliser and maybe even a winner. While those with the soft underbelly can contrive to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. Celtics new manager will have to choose wisely to replace Scott Brown as captain. Picking the skipper deserves thought. If there are plenty to choose from, its almost irrelevant who wears the armband. They will be like the manager, a facilitator, just a link in the chain.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores. Our priority now is to support affected colleagues at this dficult time. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  year-old lock came off the bench in the Boston clubs - win over the Houston Sabercats last Saturday. McCusker, a former Ulster underage player, began his sporting career playing Gaelic football with Magherafelt ODonovan Rossa before opting to pursue rugby with Rainey Old Boys. On opening day, the Free Jacks fell to a - defeat to star-studded LA Giltinis side, in the iconic Los Angeles Olympic Stadium, one that included Adam Ashley-Cooper, Dave Dennis and Matt Giteau among  Wallabies and Canadian international DTH van der Merwe. McCusker won a line-out that led to the Free Jacks final try of the game. googletag.cmd.push “It was a pretty big win so its all good,” McCusker told the County Derry Post of his  minutes of action in Saturdays victory in Texas. “We can still play better, there were a couple of things we didnt take care of, but it shows glimpses of what we can do. I think we will do well in  and try and get our hands on the MLR Shield.” He was happy with his own performance, feeling he was pretty dominant when carrying the ball, winning line-outs, was involved in mauls and made a few tackles. “I was busy with the time I got in the second half,” he added. googletag.cmd.push Both their pre-season warm-up games fell through leaving the Free Jacks on the back foot going into their first season, their first of the new league after  was declared void due to the Covid- pandemic. “The way I looked at it, was that we didnt have any game time and we still managed to score  points on them ,” McCusker points out. “There was room for improvement and we showed that we could be dangerous.” After taking care of some of the smaller details from their defeat, we focussed on their own inidual roles and attacking the Houston breakdown, it left them primed for Saturdays encounter.     “It was a sharpening of the steel, so we were hissing coming into the weekend,” McCusker added. “Physically they couldnt match us up front and then our backs were lethal. We were a doubled edged sword. We were confident with what we had, we just had to pull it off and we did.” McCusker holds dual nationality. His mother Carol is a native of Jenkintown Philadelphia, his oldest brother Philip now lives in Boston and his younger brother is pondering over a move to the Free Jacks next year after finishing university. “I started off playingfor ODonovan Rossa, thats where I got my motor skills, catching and kicking,” Ronan said of his early days. “I wasnt too bad, but rugby suited me better with all the the physical stuff and I was starting to stretch out a bit,” After playing at U, U and U level for Ulster, he ed to play for Rainey while he completed his Building Surveying Degree at Ulster University. “Thats where you learn a thing or two about rugby as you come into the senior side of the game,” he said of his time with Rainey. “Thats where I got hardened up and learned the game.” Ronan made enquiries about joining Boston club Mystic River and playing club rugby while working part-time. “Thats when the ball started rolling,” he adds. “Alex Maglebygot in contact askingI wanted to try out with Free Jacks who were forming. McCusker played in their first ever game against the Ontario Arrows and later signed a two-year deal with the Free Jacks. “After Christmas , I flew out here and it was supposed to be our first season with the MLR, but it was cancelled after five games,” he said. At home, he went into quarantine, he trained and played with Rainey until the season back home came to a halt after the second lockdown last autumn. “I was already in a good place, stayed on top of things and flew out here in January for pre-season,” McCusker added. “Ryan Martinis the best coach I have had, I have learned so much so far and I am learning every day from him at training. He pushed everyone to learn and be better. He has high expectations of everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been almost two weeks since the loss at Longford, the manner of which was surprising and disconcerting to watching City fans, who are hoping that a repeat of last season is not on the cards. Having had a fortnight to get ready, the City players are extremely focused on one thing - making up for the defeat at Longford as the first home game of the season approaches. googletag.cmd.push The disappointment that the fans felt on March  has not been ignored by those representing the club. “I think the while team and the management was quite disappointed with our showing against Longford,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s always going to be dficult in the first game of the season against a newly-promoted team. They came flying out of the blocks and they came with a lot of nervous energy and we just weren’t able to kill that in the first - minutes. “As soon as we thought we were playing our way into it, they managed to ride the wave until the th minute, and they got two good goals in fairness. googletag.cmd.push We’ve just been on the training ground in the last  days working hard and we’re really looking forward to putting that result right now on Saturday against Waterford and showing the fans what we really can do.” Preparations Former Waterford player Fitzgerald admits to being surprised that City struggle don day one, especially after a pre-season od positivity and progress. “I think it was a surprise becauseyou look at all our pre-season games, we really did see a wide iety of what League of Ireland football is all about in terms of Finn Harps, who can go long or play physical, Bohs who like to play through the thirds, Bray who are playing good football at the minute, and Shamrock Rovers ‘B’ who have a young group of talent coming through.     “We really were optimistic about the results and I think it was a bit of a kick in the teeth when the result didn’t go our way against Longford because we were very confident going into it. We knew that Daire Doyle would have his Longford side ready, but we also knew that we would be ready, but it just didn’t go our way.” City are already playing catch up because of their enforced break last week, but Fitzgerald believes that could be a blessing in disguise as it has given the team extra time to gel together ahead of a busy schedule. “It’s been very beneficial,” he stated. “We’ve been on the training ground almost every day for the last two weeks, really working hard and getting the kind of foundations of the way we want to play and the way Decky wants to play. He really impressed upon us that he wants to make the Brandywell a fortress this season, so that when teams step off the bus, they know they are going to be in for a real battle and they can’t take anything for granted against us. “Our full focus is to get our first three points on the board Saturday. There is still a long way to go,  rounds left until the end of the season so I wouldn’t be pushing the panic button just yet. We are going to come ready on Saturday and really give everything we’ve got to get the three points.” Pressure Waterford come to the Brandywell under a bit of pressure themselves after losing their opening two games, but former Blue Fitzgerald believes they will improve signicantly over the coming weeks. “They are a still a relatively unknown quantity,” he said. “Kevin Sheedy came out after the game against Sligo and said they still have one or two boys in quarantine so it will be interesting to seehe will integrate them into the starting eleven. They are a young side so they are going to grow in confidence as the weeks go on, andyou have Brian and Daryl Murphy in your squad, they will be quietly confident in any game they play.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The game swung Waterford’s way yet again on  minutes when Gartside fouled James Waite in the area, giving referee Rob Harvey an easy decision in pointing to the spot.

I don’t think they even had two shots on target, never mind two goals and we’ve just made it so dficult for ourselves to win the match.” googletag.cmd.push City are now bottom of the Premier Division after a dreadful start to the new campaign, and the signicance of this is not lost on Devine. “We’ve come away with zero points from two games and that’s down to the manager,” he admitted. “I take responsibility but ultimately we have to get better than we were in terms of our defensive knowledge and our ability to keep a clean sheet. We still had three or four chances in the game and they have got to be taken. “I felt we started quite well, we were always in control of the ball and we had some good passages of play, but I take full responsibility. We’ve lost away at Longford and at home to Waterford and with the greatest respect Derry City should be winning those games.” googletag.cmd.push  ‘Learn very quickly’ There is little time for the Derry City players to waste on regret with a dficult trip to St. Pat’s on the horizon, followed by the visit of champions Shamrock Rovers to the Brandywell. Their poor start has only added pressure to the upcoming games. “I’m absolutely gutted not to take anything from the two games,” Devine added. “We certainly shouldn’t be losing that game for the dominance that we had and the opportunities that we created, and for the lack of opportunities that they created, so it’s very disappointing, but what do you do, you have got to keep going. We had three players out there over the age of  so we have got to learn and we have got to learn very quickly. They are all tough games in this league and the first two were very tough.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Since , the local authority has been progressing with plans to restore the natural and built heritage of the forest park with several key stakeholders including Forest Service.The councilrsquos vision is to create a heritage-led destination which protects the heritage of Castlewellan Forest Park for future generations, whilst also providing opportunities for local people and visitors to learn more about the landscape.The lsquoRe-rooting our past in the Future: Castlewellan Historic Demesnersquo project will connect people with the built and natural heritage within the forest park, as well as restore and celebrate its unique bioersity.This includes the restoration of a living arboretum, containing some of the most signicant collection of trees and shrubs on the island of Ireland.As part of the project, the Grange will be developed into a visitor core with the creation of a welcome centre, community space and cafeacute facilities, with the Courtyards transformed into a vibrant visitor hub and dedicated centre for community use with interpretation, activities, events, environmental education and skills development.In addition, the landscape will be conserved and managed sensitively, protecting its plant collection and important bioersity.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said the flagship project has been designed to deliver the local authorityrsquos vision of transforming the picturesque forest park into a ldquodynamic, heritage-led destination, restoring, celebrating and interpreting the natural and built heritage of the historic demesne.And she paid tribute to members of a task-board that has supported the development of the project since .ldquoI live in Castlewellan and have been on the task-board from day one and am delighted that the council has received this financial support,she said. ldquoI look forward to the delivery of the project as it will generate local economic, social and environmental benefits.As the former demesne of the Annesley family, the forest park is steeped in natural and built heritage dating back to s.The park is an integral part of the Castlewellan community and provides locals and visitors with recreational space for outdoor activities such as, cycling, horse riding, fishing on the lake, canoeing and orienteering.At the heart of the park is the arboretum and walled Annesley Garden, the latter which provides a central focal point for the National Arboretum with the pound.m investment package designed to re-establish the historical nature of the planting in the arboretum.The Heritage Fundrsquos Northern Ireland Director, Paul Mullan, said landscapes and nature ldquoform the bedrock of our culture and heritage, improving wellbeing, sparking curiosity, and protecting and providing for the communities surrounding and inhabiting them.He continued: ldquoNational Lottery players have highlighted natural heritage as especially important, which is why we are proud to award Newry, Mourne and Down Council a grant to create a heritage-led destination at Castlewellan Historic Demesne.ldquoThe Heritage Fund is incredibly proud to be playing a role in ensuring our natural heritage is safeguarded for generations to come, but also that the projects we fund give people the chance to connect with the nature that is on their doorsteps.Council officials say it is widely acknowledged that parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting local communities, both in terms of providing recreational space, but also for supporting health and wellbeing.They add: ldquoAs we move towards recovery from Covid, the implementation of this project is timely and will benefit the citizens of the district through reconnecting people with their heritage, community and nature creating a safe, vibrant welcoming park for all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-50.jpg","title":"50 not out as Jeff clocks half century at Dundrum  ","story":"JEFF Maguirersquos love affair with cricket started  years ago.The Dundrum Cricket Club stalwart says itrsquos a love story which ranks second only to that with his family.Jeff says he is proud of the journey which has blessed him with friendships for le. These affinities were formed all across the globe, from as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Australia and across the island of Ireland.ldquoItrsquos hard to believe that I am  years going to the Meadow at Dundrum Cricket Club and I still get a buzz when going through the new gates, says Jeff.ldquoI can still remember playing in the winning side in the Downshire Cup final at the best new ground in the Northern Cricket Union at Strangford Road in Downpatrick.Jeffrsquos Dundrum side defeated Downpatrick Cricket Club, with his brother Noel scoring  odd to defeat a strong home side that featured superb players, including Alfie Linehan, Noel Ferguson and Jim Patterson, who all played for Ireland, Alfiersquos brother, Hugh, who Jeff believes should have been capped, and superb all rounder Brian Ferris.Jeff reminisces fondly of that game. ldquoI got to play in front of a decent crowd alongside two of the best club players our village ever produced, one being my brother Noel and the other being Alan Neill. I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years. Over the last decade, Tommyrsquos brother, Jack, has also been assisting, with Jeff mentioning Jack as ldquoone of the clubrsquos best ever all rounders.Jeff also applauded two more Curlett brothers, Bobby and Jim, who built the superb new electric score box free of charge.Also earning praise is new treasurer Stephen Calvert, who Jeff describes as the ldquodriving force behind the scenes, displaying fantastic forward thinking and planning everything down to the last detail.He continued: ldquoStephen now prepares the wickets, and I have never seen a harder worker in my le. From clearing the banks to planting the hedges and securing grants, he is a very tight treasurer that all clubs need.Not only a celebrated player, it is clear that Jeff has became an influential figure at the Dundrum club.Twelve years ago the club backed his request to employ the first of many successful overseas coaches, Sri Lankan Manoj Fernando.ldquoIt is the main reason the club isthriving, he said. ldquoThe junior section has been very successful with six of the players now playing for the first team and many more playing for the seconds and thirds.ldquoThe juniors have been on tour to Scotland three times, whilst also going to Telford. There is another good crop of kids coming through.Alongside his achievements on the field, Jeff nods kindly to the accolade he received in  when he was presented with the Jim McMorran Waterford Crystal Bowl for voluntary services to cricket from the Northern Cricket Union.ldquoFor my th birthday, I ran a fundraising soft ball fun match and barbecue, which raised pound, towards new set covers. I will remember as much due to the coverage legendary reporter David Holmes gave me on social media.All good things must come to an end as Jeff recalls two operations in  which forced his thoughts on retirement.Jeff decided to run a fundraiser inviting players from dferent clubs to attend. ldquoAs a thank you to a sport that has given me something that money could never buy, I ran two T games with refreshments and a raffle. I could not believe we raised pound, towards a new electric scorebox.ldquoIt was a very emotional day for me as I wandered around the ground with my grandson James. I was amazed at the decent crowd as I bowled the first ball and walked off to enjoy the day. But deep down, it hurt that I could not play.Jeff will be holding his last ever fundraiser this July, with the money going towards new enclosed two bay practice nets. He is set to organise two T games with added barbecue and refreshments as a final swansong to his beloved cricket.ldquoThe game of cricket has been a massive part of my le,  not out and burn the whites declared Jeff.He does, however, look eagerly ahead to the new season, which is planned to start the first week in May.ldquoItrsquos a testament to all the hard work at the club that it can now field three senior teams, with captain James Martin leading a very decent side for the new season. They can, no doubt, be very competitive.Looking to the future, he added: ldquoThe club is also excited about new coach Dan Kearsley, who begins his position after Easter and will be at Shimna Integrated College every Thursday.ldquoThe club is committed to attracting new young boys and girls to the great game of cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Conor keeps in contention for number one position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK goalkeeper Conor Hazard gave a very impressive display on his Windsor Park debut for Northern Ireland on Sunday evening.Hazard made a number of fine saves throughout the friendly match, but was unable to stop his side losing - to the United States.Despite starting sharply, Northern Ireland began to crack as the game approached the half hour mark.There was little the  year-old Celtic custodian could do as the USA took the lead with a heavilydeflected shot, which left him stranded.Ian Baracloughrsquos green and white army managed to steady the ship and see out the half without further damage being inflicted.There was more bad luck just  minutes into the second half as a dubious penalty was awarded to the visitors.Cha player Christian Pulisic slotted home the resulting spot kick just underneath the outstretched arm of Hazard.However, the local shot-stopper certainly did enough to keep himself in Baracloughrsquos plans as a contender for the number one position.He made a fine save to deny Daryl Dikersquos attempt and prevent the match being put to bed early.The goalkeeper again got the better of Dike, after saving superbly with ten minutes left to go on the clock.There was no respite for Hazard, as just minutes later he was once more called into action to prevent Sebastian Lletget from adding a third goal.A late resurgence from the home team was a case of too little, too late as Niall McGinn thumped home a spectacular effort for a consolation goal.Northern Ireland face Bulgaria tonight in their second World Cup qualying match after being beaten by -

An action plan is needed so that the corridor can form part of an investment-led recovery from Covid and Brexit.Mr Varadkar said the corridor was about bringing North and South closer together and enhancing economic and social co-operation between Dublin and Belfast, as well as the areas in between..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/30th September 2020 Delight.jpg","title":"Delight for anglers after department back stands  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK anglers have welcomed confirmation from a leading government department that new disabled fishing stands could be provided on the banks of the Quoile River.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas confirmed that the Environment Agency is to be asked to approve the possible installation of the stands beside two designated disabled parking bays at a redeveloped car park beside the riverrsquos floodgates.In addition, anglers say there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.DAERA mdash which has agreed to meet with local anglers mdash saidthe new stands are provided, they will reduce the need for those with mobility issues to have to make their way to an existing stand around a quarter of a mile from the car park which was recently redeveloped.Anglers had expressed concern that a new barrier erected on a wall which separates the car park from the waterway prevents disabled anglers from fishing at this particular location.They say that the need to provide fishing stands for those with mobility issues was being discussed bycivil servants over one year ago, calling for them to provided as soon as possible.DAERA insists that the riverside car park was never designated either as a specic angling area or one for the use of disabled fishermen, conceding that local anglers disagree with this point which is why a meeting with them to discuss the issue is necessary.In a recent letter to anglers, the government department confirmed that neither it nor Disability NI were consulted about the work at the Quoile car park as it would not restrict or remove disabled angling facilities. Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week in those businesses while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.Developing Rathkeltair House as a regional jobs hub has been welcomed by a number of local politicians who say that the opportunity to combine working from home with the traditional office experience, enables civil servants to have a much more attractive work le balance as part of the Covid- recovery.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was delighted that Rathkeltair House was one of several new regional civil servant job hubs which will allow public sector staff to work closer from home.ldquoThere are many people who travel from the Downpatrick area each day to Belfast and by reducing this number to allow them to work locally can produce a benefit for local

eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents an opportunity to redesign the layout to provide a modern style of development on a prominent site at the corner of the Magheraknock Road and Ballynahinch Road which will provide a convenient roadside

The average percentage of cars travelling in excess of mph has also decreased slightly.Additional speed indicators are due to be erected at the Dundrum Road in Clough, Downpatrick Road in Ardglass and Ballynahinchrsquos Saintfield Road, with the PCSP planning to install seven more during the new financial year.But demand for the devices is high with a total of  requests lodged with the PCSP for them to be provided in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Willie Clarke have expressed concern that some drivers are continue to speed in built-up areas but have welcomed confirmation that overall, speeding in a number of hot spot areas is decreasing.Mr McGrath described the speeds recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick as ldquohorric and chilling.He continued: ldquoWhata local resident or child was to step onto this busy road  The footpaths are narrow in places, the lighting in the area is poor and residents are at times walking and driving in fear for their lives.ldquoSuch high speeds will not help allay their fears and I will be writing to the PSNI and asking for regular speed checks on this road to regulate the speed and ensure residentsrsquo safety.Cllr Clarke said while some of the speeds are very worrying, he said the data recorded by the speed indicator devices provides police with the information about where they need to be and at what time to catch those who are breaking the law and putting other road users and pedestrians at risk.ldquoI welcome the reduction in speed which the data reveals, but more needs to be done. Police now have the data they need to catch offenders and this is something that many people want to see happening, he continued.Cllr Clarke said the Department for Infrastructure also has a role to play in helping address the speeding issue.ldquoThe speed devices are having an impact and with plans for many more across the district, it is important that the critical data they provide will enable the authorities to apprehend those who are not only breaking the law, but placing themselves, other road users and pedestrians at risk, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Strangford.jpg","title":"Strangford it’s like nowhere else on earth  ","story":"STUNNING Strangford Lough features prominently in a new Sunday Times guide with the area regarded as one of the three best places to live in Northern Ireland.While the accolade will not come as a major surprise to those who live and work on both sides of the internationally acclaimed waterway, the arearsquos recognition by one of the UK and Irelandrsquos top selling Sundays is nonetheless extremely noteworthy.While Holywood has been named as the top place to live in Northern Ireland in the Sunday Times Best Places to Live guide mdash ahead of Magherafelt mdash local focus will rightly be on Strangford Loughrsquos inclusion in the top three.The Sunday Timesrsquos expert judges behind the guide assess a wide range of factors, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speeds to culture, green spaces and the health of the high street.They look for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit which the coronavirus pandemic has shown to be the most vital quality of all.Of Strangford, the judges said: ldquoLive in Strangford, Portaferry or any of the villages around this beautul island-studded lough and yoursquove got unbeatable wildle and scenery on the doorstep ndash and itrsquos even betteryou can get out on the water. Downpatrick, Newtownards and Belfast are all within easy reach, too.Not surprisingly, the judges also liked the excellent restaurants in Strangford including the Lobster Pot, Artisan Cookhouse and The Cuan.Helen Davies, The Times and Sunday Times Property Editor, said the annual guide has never been so important.ldquoThe pandemic has taught us just how much we rely on our homes, our communities and our surroundings, she said.ldquoWith working from home now common, itrsquos no surprise that many of us are reassessing our priorities and thinking hard about where we really want to live.Helen added: ldquoOur focus for this year has been community, countryside and convenience. It hasnrsquot been a year for big cities or small villages. Instead it is small towns that have shone: big enough to have everything you need within walking distance and small enough for everyone to feel connected.Breathtakingly beautul, Strangford Lough, sheltered from the Irish Sea by the friendly arm of the Ards Peninsula, is a magnet for anyone craving an easy le beside one of naturersquos loveliest watery playgrounds.It is also where thousands of Brent geese from Canada spend the winter adding a touch of colour and noise to the famous waterway.Strangford Loughrsquos tranquil shores offer visitors a  days a year destination where a friendly welcome awaits, whatever the weather.They can experience sailing, kayaking, ing, canoeing, bird watching, fishing, kite surfing, windsurfing, boating and, when the weather is right, paddling and swimming.The ferry crossing, while essential for residents and commuters to cross the waterway, is also something of a tourist attraction in its own right.Located at the tip of the Ards Peninsula, Portaferry, is well known for its fishing, seafront, Triathlon and the annual gala week float parade.The powerful current which rushes through The Narrows carries  million gallons of water with every tide and in addition to being a great place to live, the village is also popular with visitors, many sampling its hospitality and visiting the hugely popular Exploris aquarium.Portaferry is also home to the impressive Portico, a recently restored grade A listed building modelled on the Greek Temple of Nemesis.Portico is a multi-purpose venue that hosts cultural, educational and heritage events and exhibitions. In addition, it also houses a permanent exhibition about the arearsquos fascinating archaeological heritage of Neolithic settlements, Norman forts and industrial architecture.Marty OrsquoNeill, who blogs at Dish You Were Here, said of Strangford Lough: ldquoItrsquos like nowhere  on earth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Young.jpg","title":"Young drinkers responsible for most disorderly incidents  ","story":"YOUNG people drinking and being disorderly accounted for the overwhelming majority of the  incidents Newry, Mourne and Down Council community safety wardens responded to in the Downpatrick and Newcastle areas during the first three months of the year, it has been revealed.The figures were confirmed at last nightrsquos meeting of the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipand relate to a period between January and March .District-wide, wardens responded to , incidents over this period which in addition to Downpatrick and Newcastle, included Newry, Warrenpoint and Rostrevor.There have also been reports of increased anti-social behaviour in the Castlewellan, Dundrum and Ballynahinch areas.Wardens attended  incidents in Downpatrick mdash which witnessed a recent upsurge in anti-social behaviour mdash with three of the incidents reported to police.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMonday, April , marks the official ftieth birthday of Chapter Arts Centre in Cardf.The multi-artform venue was the first of its kind in Wales.CEO of Chapter, Andy Eagle said: ldquoChapter was originally set up by a community of artists and that remains its foundation and principal purpose. Itrsquos an eclectic and fascinating place that has, over the last fty years, evolved to be welcoming and inclusive to many dferent types of peopleChapter Arts Centre came to le thanks to the driving force of writer Mik Flood and artists Christine Kinsey and Bryan Jones.CEO Chapter Andy Eagle. Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices. Chapter Fundraising gig, Pavilions in the Park. Photo courtesy of Christine KinseyToabout the history of Chapter and itrsquos early years between  and , visit: www.issuu chapter docs earlyyears_copy.Five decades on, Chapter has grown into one of the largest arts complexes in Europe, with two cinemas, two theatres, a gallery, a large number of artistsrsquo studios and creative industry offices, meeting places for the community and a cafeacute bar.Chapter in the early daysIt produces and presents the best in national and international contemporary visual art, experimental and thought-provoking performance, and challenging independent, mainstream and international films, all alongside an inclusive learning and engagement programme.     Every year, the venue welcomes , visitors to more than  film screenings,  live performances,  visual art exhibitions and  community classes, artisan fairs and events.Mr Eagle added: ldquoChapter is many dferent things to many dferent people. For some, it will be the international gallery exhibitions and the programme of independent films.\"For others, it will be the cafeacute bar and restaurant to meet friends before a Cardf City home game, or it will be for dance and theatre classes or a cup of tea before working in the community garden.\"But at its heart itrsquos a centre for contemporary art, supporting artists and creatives from Wales and beyond to produce and present work.Chapter works with practitioners at every stage in their careers, supporting and stimulating opportunities for exciting new talent as well as promoting the work of established artists.It is a springboard for the creative community of Wales with a focus on bringing the world to Wales and Wales to the world.Chapter is home to over  of Walesrsquo most dynamic creative companies and artists, including BAFTA Cymru, Printhaus, ie ie Productions, Everyman Theatre, Beryl Productions, Cardf Music School and Taking Flight Theatre. Chapter has remained open to this creative community during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:They also offer a range of spaces in support of local artists and companies for the research and development of artistic projects, including Hijinx Theatre.Like most art and entertainment venues, the last year has been one of the most dficult times for the organisation as they were forced to close their doors. MrEagle commented: ldquoClosure has had a massive impact on us. We are an arts organisation that generates almost all of its income through ticket sales, classes, hires, cafeacute bar and other activity.\"The small remaining amount comes fromArts Council of Wales and is used to support our arts and education programme. Our capacity to earn incomeliterally stopped overnight and that was profoundly scary.Support has been generated from extremely generous public donations and from a range of funders including Arts Council Wales, Welsh Government, BFI, Art Fund, Ffilm Cymru and Admiral.Since its closure, Chapter has offered an exciting Chapter from Home programme, consisting of over  virtual film screenings, online theatre productions and art exhibitions, monthly online comedy gigs presented by Welsh comedian Robin Morgan, virtual lectures with Arts Society Cardf, as well as outdoor theatre performances with Cardf-based companies including Theatr Iolo and Kitsch  Sync.Currently showing at Chapteris internationally focussed art exhibition Artes Mundi.

In the Gallery are immersive works by South African artist Dineo Seshee Bopape - objects, drawing and sound are presented in spaces with walls covered in washes of soil from Welsh sacred sites.Talking about the programme since Chapter closed, Director of Programme Hannah Firth said: ldquoWhen our doors closed in March last year we wanted to ensure that we could still talk to our audiences and the creative community that is our beating heart.\"Despite the uncertainty faced by many artists, they showed an astonishing resilience and desire to quickly adapt to other ways of working and engaging.\"Wersquove been lucky enough to be able to work with some of them to create a dynamic programme of events and activity online and outdoors, and have developed a number of key commissions to support artists including on our lightbox, in our cafeacute bar, in our gallery, around the Canton community, and online.Chapter is currently getting ready to re-open. Depending on Covid guidelines, they hope to welcome customers back outdoors sometime after Easter, and they have been working hard to improve their outdoor catering offer to keep visitors warm and cosy day and night.Although Chapter canrsquot bring everyone together for a big Birthday party as planned, they will celebrate their five decades through to next April with a series of special events, activities and online content - they particularly have some exciting plans for outdoor events this summer.Mr Eagle said: ldquoNeedless to say  is not the year we were anticipating for our th!ldquoWhile the move to digital is great in many ways, ultimately, people want to be able to enjoy themselves and meet and do things in person.

We have been Stronger Together throughout this pandemic, however, the increase in cases in recent days in the Fermanagh and Omagh District has demonstrated that we are not there yet and we cannot become complacent. Easter and Spring are signs of rebirth and new beginnings and the successful roll out of the vaccination programme at this time has provided us with much needed hope and encouragement in what has been a dficult time for us all. I believe that we will emerge from the signicant challenges posed by Covid-, stronger as a District and we will continue to work together to support each other and our local businesses by following public health advice to keep our distance from others, wear a face covering and wash and practice good hand hygiene. We can still have a ‘cracking’ good Easter and find alternative ways to celebrate at home. If you are looking for some egg-citing Easter activities to do at home, please visit the social media pages for the Council, the Ardhowen Theatre and Strule Arts Centre for where you will see a whole host of fun activities to keep you entertained over the Easter break. If you are taking advantage of the better weather over the holiday weekend and visiting your local park or public space, please continue to follow the guidance in relation to Covid- guidance. Please also remember to try to avoid busy times and also use the designated car parking spaces and Leave No Trace to ensure we can protect our environment for the enjoyment of all. I would like to pay tribute, once again, to our residents who have, throughout the pandemic, exercised restraint and adhered to the myriad of regulations and restrictions. Your continued efforts, coupled with the vaccination programme, have got us to where we are now. The light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter. We are nearly there and one final push will get us over the line.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dcbdaffdaea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_effdadbcdddaf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1617379713897.jpg--covid_19___fri_2nd_apr_figures.jpg?161737971400","title":"covid  fri nd apr figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  positive test results.

But I would appeal to people not to let their frustrations affect their judgement. These restrictions are in place to protect us from a vicious virus that has brought great tragedy to so many families. “When we are following them, we are helping keep ourselves and others safe – and helping our community get to a better place. “We are continuing to make good progress. The statistics on COVID- have been moving steadily in the right direction and more than three quarters of a million people in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccine dose. “We are on a pathway towards gradually easing restrictions. Theof schools and expansion of outdoor activities are the first careful steps on this route map. He added: Some regulations have been eased this week, and more welcome decisions will steadily followwe can keep COVID- infections down. “But it’s still important to follow the basics. That includes maintaining social distancing, wearing a face covering and washing hands frequently and well. Stay at home as much as possible and stay local when you are enjoying the great outdoors. Avoid crowded places, especially where it would be hard to keep your distance from others. “Make fresh air your friend this Easter weekend – outdoors is much safer than indoors. Please please don’t mix indoors with people from other households. “I want to thank everyone once again for all they have done over the past year to help repel COVID. We still need to keep our guard up for this next period, as we look forward to summer.” The department has also today issued a factfile: https:www.health-ni.gov.uk news ive-just-had-vaccine-what-can-i-do-now,  This advises people who have received the vaccine to keep following public health advice on the COVID- threat.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_abebecdef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_badfecca   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1617468679790.jpg--covid_19___sat_3rd_apr_figures.jpg?161746867900","title":"covid  sat rd apr figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
