They were welcomed by co-head teachers, Stephanie Shaldas and Edmund Coogan, and were introduced to some of the youngest pupils at a play session.Kate, in a pink Max \u0026amp Co coat, knelt down to talk to children in a pop-up cafe, while William helped a girl building a wall in the playground\u0027s construction area. Later he sat on a raised floor talking to a little boy who was brandishing a clipboard as Kate went to a water play area and then joined children in a sand pit hunting for treasure.\u0027Is it fun to be back with all your friends?\u0027 she asked them.Kate and William then joined teachers and staff involved in the Mentally Healthy Schools project to talk about its aims and impact on children.They sat in a circle outside the school because of Covid restrictions. After the television reporter\u0027s questions were fired at William, it looked as though he may have apologised to Miss Shaldas for bringing his family\u0027s traumas into the playground.Andrea Silvain, a deputy head at the 1,200-pupil free school, said the last year of lockdowns had brought teachers and parents closer together and families had appreciated the help that the mental health website had given.\u0027We\u0027ve had some very positive feedback from parents,\u0027 she said.\u0027People have been through this lockdown together,\u0027 William replied.Children at School 21, which educates around 1,200 pupils aged from four to 18, will be given access to lessons on issues such as anxiety and depression.Ironically, the lessons are on a website financed from an initial £800,000 grant from the then royal foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.Kate has championed the idea of early intervention by experts to help children struggling with mental health problems. "},{"url":null,"title":"How cryptocurrency uses electricity transaction method","story":"Share this articleDigiconomist - Exposing the Unintended Consequences of Digital TrendsThe Unreasonable Ecological Cost of #CryptoArt.

Northern Ireland has made proportionately faster progress than the Republic in reaching the most vulnerable.Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin held \u0027positive\u0027 discussions with AstraZeneca chief executive officer Pascal Soriot on Friday evening.He has expressed frustration at the failure of the company to meet delivery schedules for inoculations.Ireland\u0027s Minister of State for Mental Health and Older people has said Ireland \u0027is still on track\u0027 to have all over-70s vaccinated by mid-May with the supplies they have received to date, despite disruption from AstraZeneca.Earlier this week, AstraZeneca dismissed concerns that its Covid-19 vaccine is linked to blood clots - joining the WHO, No 10 and EU regulators in rejecting the fears that have led several European countries to suspend their use of the jab. The pharma giant said its analysis of more than 10million records showed there was \u0027no evidence of an increased risk\u0027 in any age group or any batch of doses, after Austria and others black-listed a particular shipment over fears of side-effects. \u0027In fact, the observed number of these types of events are significantly lower in those vaccinated than would be expected among the general population,\u0027 the firm said. EU regulators are looking into 30 cases of blood clots among nearly five million people who have had a dose of the vaccine, after Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspended their use of the jab altogether this week. Austria, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg have suspended one batch of doses after a 49-year-old nurse died soon after getting one of the jabs. But AstraZeneca\u0027s findings today match those of the EU safety panel which says there is \u0027no indication\u0027 the nurse\u0027s death was caused by side-effects from the vaccine and found that the batch in question is \u0027unlikely\u0027 to be defective.  Despite Austria\u0027s concerns, chancellor Sebastian Kurz sought to rally support for the AstraZeneca shot today by saying that he himself would be injected with it. Kurz, one of the world\u0027s youngest leaders at 34, said he would take the jab in order to \u0027show that I trust this vaccine\u0027 which has become an unloved choice in Europe after top officials feuded with AstraZeneca and questioned the shot\u0027s effectiveness.  Germany and France are pressing ahead with AstraZeneca jabs, rejecting the blood clot fears, after Downing Street yesterday urged Britons to keep taking the shots.  WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris also weighed in by telling reporters: \u0027Yes, we should continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Over a series of interviews, it became clear that I was not cut out to be George Smiley, let alone James Bond. A single bit of wisdom that I picked up in that process has never left me, though. At one point, the interviewer set out the hypothetical details of a complex conflict in a distant corner of the world in which I was theoretically stationed.What steps would I take to advise the desk in London of how to respond to this crisis? I set out a few embarrassing platitudes about gathering information from all sides, before coming to a firm opinion and a clear course of action. When I’d finished, my interviewer leaned back in his chair.“There is a crucial question you haven’t asked yourself,” he said.“Why do we need to have a strong, settled opinion about this conflict at all?”In the years since, as strong, settled opinions about everything from homeschooling to hijabs have apparently become essential markers of personal identity, I’ve often been reminded of that put-down. It came to mind watching Oprah’s interview with Meghan and Harry and the inevitable, fevered which-side-are-you-on? arguments that followed. “Do I need to have a strong, settled opinion about this?” a voice in my head asked. On balance, I guessed, “probably not”.Life’s Edge, a new book by Carl Zimmer, science columnist for the New York Times, explores the history of thinking about what it means to be alive. The most newsworthy chapter centres on the nature of viruses. When viruses – “oily bubbles of genes” – were first properly identified in the 1930s, Zimmer suggests, they appeared to occupy a new category of existence: they mutated, but they did not grow or eat or reproduce. They were “not as alive as an eel or dead as a rock”. In the past year, we may feel we have got to know the habits of one particular virus – Sars-CoV-2 – too well. As Zimmer points out, there are plenty more viruses for us to discover, not least the 140,000-plus species now known to exist, generally quite happily, in our gut. Are they alive or dead? The scientific and philosophical jury is still out.Rupert Murdoch turned 90 last week. There was a time when it looked like he might be slowing down, contemplating the end – out of that imagined last act, the drama of Succession was born. Since his marriage to Jerry Hall, however, he has seemed as up for the fight as ever. His mother lived to be 103. Executives at News Corp long ago coined the euphemism “in 30 years” to tread carefully around the post-Rupert future. Apparently, depressingly, the phrase is still in use.So far this year, daily life outside has been like watching football on TV without the simulated crowd reaction. Last week, though, I was stopped in my tracks by the return of the most joyous background noise of any street: that high-pitched cacophony of schoolchildren yelling and screaming and running every which way in a blustery playground, just because they can. Martin Buber, the philosopher, had a nice term for it: “Play is the exultation of the possible.” Just as good, as I stood listening, was a sudden memory of that childhood hymn that described “rough and tumble, rattle and noise”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fb8b7e2a3c4c23119cd6b1904a247b6c34027a6/0_757_6847_4109/master/6847.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=840126a660b880a1ca4ede7ed779ce3c","title":"a community of equals the private school with no fees set up by a south london teacher","story":"Lucy Stephens was tired of ‘shoehorning’ pupils through tests. Her new school has no Sats, no behaviour policy – and an idea for a novel funding systemWhile most teachers express frustration about the education system in England, with its focus on Sats, GCSEs and league tables, what they don’t usually do is set up their own school instead. But that is exactly what Lucy Stephens did.Stephens had been a primary teacher for six years but grew disillusioned and left. “I was just shoehorning kids through test papers,” she says. “Everything was so competitive. You’d find the headteacher in your room, looking through your books, checking on you. Behaviour managers can rule by fear, the staff as well as pupils. I’ve seen them scream at kids in front of the whole school, humiliating them.” Stephens, 31, decided to resign and work for The Prince’s Trust charity, helping vulnerable young people. But now she is back teaching – this time in her very own school, where she writes the rules and sets the pace.The New School, based in Croydon, south London, opened its doors in September. It has no Sats and no behaviour policy, and operates on a “democratic” decision-making model for pupils and staff. It can escape statutory testing because it is a private school – but one with no fees. It is funded by philanthropic company donations – £1m of seed funding this year – although Stephens hopes to move to a completely different funding model involving her local authority, believing she can offer a social partnership approach which could be copied by other schools that want to innovate.The main aim is to create a mini democracy. Many schools have become focused on maintaining a hierarchy to control children’s behaviour, rather than listening to them or building meaningful relationships with them, she says. “We live in a democracy, but we don’t practise that model in schools. And then we expect young people to come out aged 18 and operate democratically in society.” The idea is for “self-determination within a community of equals”.“It’s important not to just say that children are adults in the making,” she says. “Why would we just ignore them now? They have such valid opinions, such interesting takes on things.”The idea of opening her own school came to Stephens when she had her first child. “I thought, what should I do now? I don’t want them in this system. I don’t want them to have to stand on a traffic light or a rain cloud if they disobey an instruction,” she says, referring to the sort of behaviour policies in place in some schools.UK children report the lowest life satisfaction across Europe, the Children’s Society found last year – with school pressures and “fear of failure” scoring high. But when Stephens began researching other models, such as Steiner and Montessori schools, she hit the catch: fees. She could not set up a free school, because then Sats would be obligatory, and “it would likely have taken four to five years”.“So I called everybody I’d ever worked with in fundraising, impact, in marketing, and said, ‘can I buy you a coffee?’. You get a lot of people looking at you like you’re mad,” she says. “They think, ‘that’s a nice idea’, or ‘she seems sweet’.” But eventually she secured £1m to open her small school, going entirely against the “economies of scale” drive behind the government’s preferred academy trust model. She is not telling who the current financial backers are, describing them as “generous philanthropic iniduals and a corporate foundation”. But she says none of the funders has political connections or a political agenda, and the corporate foundation supports other projects in education and healthcare that tackle disadvantage. “They’re like maverick funders in the system.”In some ways, the school is not all that radical, she says. “We emphasise good teaching and we still recognise there’s a qualification system in the UK and we can work around that.” Pupils get about three to four hours of English and maths teaching each week. But an “interdisciplinary, concept-based curriculum” as found in Finland, in which topics rather than distinct subjects are taught, is being introduced, along with “self-directed” learning for a couple of hours each day. Classes have mixed age groups. None of these ideas is new, but they have been looked on with suspicion by the most powerful voices in education for the past decade.Instead of a behaviour policy, the school operates “community accountability”. That means there is no system of punishment, only “restorative justice” circles in which actions are discussed and apologies given, a deliberate inversion of the hierarchy-driven, “untrusting” system Stephens found so disheartening.The funding this year equates to £17,000 a pupil, equivalent to an average boarding school place, which she expects to reduce to £11,000 when the school is at capacity (compare that with the minimum 2021-22 funding of £4,180 per pupil in English primary schools). Parents know they have taken a risk in sending their children here, and were asked to sign a form to say they were aware that just one year’s funding had been secured. Stephens says she is on the brink of getting the second year agreed, but after that is hoping to adopt a model called “social outcomes commissioning”. Under this agreement, a private funding organisation stumps up the cash for an organisation to reach a particular set of “social outcomes” required by a body with statutory funding, such as a local authority. Once those outcomes are reached, the public body pays back the original funder, plus a small fee.A school in Doncaster is already operating such a model, and Stephens believes such contracts could offer other schools the chance to innovate and avoid the current accountability structures. Nevertheless, the New School will still have to face the state inspectorate, Ofsted. Can she succeed in disrupting the system? Jonathan Simons, from the consultants Public First, says that for the model to work, Stephens will have to convince her local authority it can save money and reach specific goals, such as reducing exclusions. “It has to be a set-up where the council is saving money directly and getting outcomes in a shorter timeframe than it otherwise would,” he says. “If it’s a very small institution, the savings might not be enough.”The school has been deluged with job applications from frustrated state school teachers and the staff have high hopes. “There is a problem in the system, and we can solve it,” Stephens says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d17c5203b12126cad94c3a24fa4d22807a108e0e/0_144_850_850/master/850.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d58edd9143a1ded90cb27d8a0bb6ed59 960w","title":"southampton v brighton premier league live","story":"33 min Maupay is fouled 30 yards from goal by Bednarek.

But in the actual table they are 17th, with 26 points, and in serious danger of becoming one of the best teams ever to be relegated from the Premier League.While Brighton’s bad luck has been on the field, Southampton’s has been off it.

In Reykjavik, 30,000 women marched up the Laugavegur (wash road), as a women’s brass band played the marching tune from Shoulder to Shoulder, a British TV series about the suffragettes which had recently aired in this small Nordic nation. Flyers fluttered against clear autumn skies: “We march because it is commonly said about a housewife: ‘She is not working, she is just keeping house’,” they read. “We march because the work experience of a housewife is not considered of any value in the labour market.”For Icelandic men, this day became known as the “Long Friday”. With no women to staff desks and tills, banks, factories and many shops were forced to close, as were schools and nurseries – leaving many fathers with no choice but to take their children to work. There were reports of men arming themselves with sweets and colouring crayons to entertain the swarms of children in their workplaces, or bribing older children to look after their siblings. Sausages (easy to cook, of course, and a hit with children the world over) were in such demand that shops sold out children could be heard giggling in the background while male newsreaders reported the day’s events on the radio.Many of the greatest successes of feminism have come in moments when boots were on the ground and our bodies elsewhere to the posts ascribed to women by patriarchal capitalism. In the UK, public reaction to the sexual violence meted out against the 300 women who marched to parliament demanding women’s suffrage on 18 November 1910, Black Friday, was instrumental in gaining the vote for women. The 1968 strike by Ford’s women sewing machinists at Dagenham, which was followed by 1970 strikes by women clothing workers in Leeds, were landmark labour-relations dispute that triggered the passing of the Equal Pay Act 1970.“A women’s strike is impossible that is why it is necessary,” claims Women’s Strike Assembly (WSA), an activist alliance that, to mark last week’s International Women’s Day, called for a series of banner memorials to be erected around the UK to declare why #westrike as women (or, just as importantly, why we can’t). In a manifesto published in November, WSA wrote: “We strike because we are tired of our labour being taken for granted. We strike because we now have to do a triple shift: our paid work, our unpaid domestic labour and educating our children during the pandemic.”In Liverpool, Bristol and Edinburgh women gathered, last Monday, in socially distanced clusters toting their banner memorials. “#westrike because we are tired. Very, very tired,” a banner in Liverpool read and a memorial painted by Bristol Sisterhood stated, simply: “Fuck macho bullshit, women on fire.” Many of the social media protests, however, indicated why last Monday saw no wholesale abandonment of women’s posts. “I am a freelancer and I would not get paid (or lose my client!). But I’m striking with my compañeras in mind and spirit,” one IWD banner read, and another: “I cannot strike but I lit a candle in solidarity.”Recent years have seen a flowering of strikes against gendered labour in Spain and South America. In 2018, six million women joined Spain’s 2018 “Dia Sin Mujeres’ (day without women), including Madrid’s Manuela Carmena and actress Penelope Cruz, as “feminist men in solidarity” staffed a network of collective nurseries. Old-fashioned mother’s aprons, the symbol of the strikes, were stitched in solidarity workshops and strung from balconies. But, in Britain, women’s general labour strikes have been conspicuously absent.Selma James, the cofounder of 70s marxist activist project Wages for Housework, has a theory to account for this lack. She points out that as the power of unions dwindles, the climate in Anglo-Saxon countries is less hospitable to gestures of withdrawn labour, even as feminist identity marches gain broader support. Without union protection, British and north American women who strike from paid work risk losing their jobs to the single mum on the breadline in a pandemic, strikes, in this context, seem the preserve of privileged white feminists.James, in the meantime, advocates a daily constellation of “small resistances”: banging pots and pans at your window stringing up a banner and apron radically lowering domestic standards.Forty-five years after the Women’s Day Off, Iceland has ranked top in the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report – an index that examines educational opportunities, life expectancy, pay equity and the average time spent on housework – in 13 of the past 16 years.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, tells Anushka Asthana that it was then that the five-year nightmare began.

But why?If you go by the headlines, there’s a trading boom in something called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Grimes has sold $6m of art via NFTs Kings of Leon will be releasing their new album as two types of NFT, and a 10-second digital artwork bought via an NFT for $67,000 in October last year has just sold for $6.6m. Twitter boss Jack Dorsey’s first tweet is up for auction as an NFT and may fetch as much as $2.5m.To their advocates, NFTs track the ownership and guarantee the authenticity of art – and allow creators to monetise digital artefacts. To sceptics, they’re a bubble within a bubble, a speculative frenzy that shows how far from sanity investors have gone.But to most of us, the burning question is surely: what is an NFT? And why are we suddenly hearing so much about them?Non-fungible token is unlikely to win points for the catchiest of names. The “token” signals it is a blockchain-related product – a token is essentially a catch-all term for units on a blockchain, code which identifies the unique NFT and also the history of its trading. So a bitcoin would be a token, as would a dogecoin, and so on.The “non-fungible” bit comes down to the difference between, say, pound coins and Panini stickers. One pound coin is pretty much the same as any other pound coin – it can be traded for exactly the same amount, and there’s no material difference between any two of them. Things that follow these rules are known as “fungible”. If units are “non-fungible”, it means that we see differences between each of them. If someone collected Panini stickers of Premier League footballers, they might all be the same size and dimensions and clearly all belong to the same set – but people will value one of a player they don’t have much more highly than one they do.Cryptocurrencies are fungible – each bitcoin is worth the same as every other and is functionally identical to them too. What NFTs do, then, is allow something unique to be registered on to a blockchain.Their advocates say that this allows you to do something new when it comes to the digital world: mark something as the “original”. While every copy of a particular gif or jpeg is identical, there would only be one (or a limited number) of NFT versions of it, creating a concept similar to the real-world one of artists selling an original versus hundreds of prints of it for much less.The point and promise of an NFT would seem to be just this – but the reality is quite different. The idea of a blockchain is it’s an unfalsifiable public ledger of ownership. The bitcoin blockchain tracks which wallets own which bitcoins, and tracks the transactions between the two.An NFT does identify what artwork, code, audio or video it links to, and the history of its trading. So, where there is an NFT artefact that’s been created by the artist (for example, Azealia Banks’s new audio sex tape, sold last week for $17,000), owning the NFT is the same as owning the art.But it’s not always that simple. One anonymous digital artist has been creating NFTs in the style of Banksy. The NFT does nothing to identify that artist, or settle the debate over whether or not the artworks are actually by Banksy. Similarly, you could create an NFT of the Observer logo right now, but it wouldn’t give you any rights to the trademark, or any copyright. Stating that you own the NFT to a particular work on its own means nothing if someone else can demonstrate they own the copyright. That means, in what should be the simplest-use case for NFTs – a digital artist using them to sell his or her own work – when auction houses have stepped in to manage the trade they have brought in traditional certifying bodies to verify that the person making the NFT is the original artist.A system that supposedly outsources the need for intermediaries to verify trust, then, ends up reliant on those intermediaries.NFTs have been around for a few years, and fuelled a mini-online craze in 2017-18 – CryptoKitties. This centred around algorithmically generated pictures of fantastical (but usually cute) cats which could be bought and traded as NFTs – with the automated system also ensuring some would be rarer than others. The combination of elements of gaming, collection and trading were well suited to the tech.The newest surge is seeing people pay tens of thousands for the NFT of something you would typically expect to see circulate on social media for free – animated gifs taking mere minutes of work, such as an animated cat altered to include dogecoin selling for $69,000.It should not be hard to see why digital artists are jumping on to the NFT movement: it is a chance for them to make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars for artwork that many people class as mediocre at best.Similarly, the motivation for the buyers and traders is surely grounded in getting rich quickly. Most cryptocurrencies have little to base their values on: bitcoin is barely used as a real-world currency – it is bought by people hoping it will be worth more in the future. Its value lies solely in the fact that other people value it.NFTs at least have some kind of scarcity and real-world link – however tenuous. So, in the middle of a blockchain boom, it’s a new and exciting outlet for speculative money.Not necessarily. It might be the case in the future that they could be used to prove ownership (or to watermark) source code or something similar, for example – or, with appropriate frameworks, to track digital rights ownership properly, if their reputation can survive the initial land grab.That is not a given, though: blockchain is notoriously energy intensive, and so, at the moment, NFT risks being an environmentally damaging way to pay tens of thousands (or millions) of dollars for a gif that is different from all the other copies of that same gif solely because of the certificate you paid for. If that sounds like a good transaction to you, then please do get in touch – I have a digital bridge to sell you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e1dc3f005692b815b1bc6b0ab3872c348022c9b/0_130_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4c7982f31a8742b5083b7575139e13d7","title":"kern oil field","story":"Kern county has approved the drilling of thousands of new wells despite opposition from farmers and activistsThis week the county approved an ordinance that would allow thousands of new wells to be drilled over the next 15 years. The decision comes despite deep opposition from local farmers and environmental groups, and it puts the county directly at odds with a state that has branded itself as a trailblazer on climate and set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.In doing so, Kern has become a microcosm of a debate happening across America – and around the world – about how to tackle the climate crisis in communities that are built on fossil fuels.“Kern county runs on oil,” as the county chairman, Phillip Peters, concisely puts it.The debate has been going on for years, according to Ethan Elkind, a director at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. “What you are seeing here is the main oil and gas producing county in California is going one direction and the state is trying to go a different direction,” he explains, “and it’s so far unwilling to override the county on the issue of local oil and gas production.”“This is a fiscal imbalance that has to be resolved before you start talking about a just transition,” said Lorelei Oviatt, the director of the Kern county planning and natural resources department, during Monday’s vote to approve the new ordinance. “We are looking at the difference between $1.5m a year and $80m a year. Until that is resolved, the idea of banning fossil fuel extraction does not seem realistic.”Roughly one in seven workers in Kern are employed by the industry or tied to it. A county analysis done last year found that the oil and gas industry funded the county to the tune of almost $200m a year. Roughly half of that, $103m, went to Kern county schools.The question over Kern county’s future came to a head on Monday at a community meeting before the county’s vote on the new drilling plans. Hundreds of people from the community and across California called in to speak. Mike Maggard, a county supervisor, called it the “longest public hearing on a single issue” he had seen in his long career.Farmers voiced concerns about how the land, water, and air would be affected, while justice advocates highlighted how increased pollution would take the harshest toll on the most vulnerable. Others shared their stories about how the oil industry had given them job opportunities that changed their lives.After a meeting that stretched across nearly 11 hours, it took the county board of supervisors minutes to vote unanimously to approve the new ordinance.The ordinance, a scaled-back version of one that originally passed in 2015 but was struck down after an environmental review, will allow for roughly 40,000 wells to be permitted through 2034. It also requires producers to take steps to soften their impact on the environment, including paying into funds to help mitigate some of the negative impacts.An environmental impact assessment conducted by the county found many problems could not be avoided, including more issues with air and water quality and increases in greenhouse gas emissions. The new projects will also put greater strain on the groundwater supply in an agricultural region that already struggles with drought, and where many lack access to clean drinking water.But there is a trove of recoverable reserves still left in the ground, according to reports from the US Energy Information Administration, including approximately 2bn barrels of oil and 1.5tn cubic feet of natural gas, and Kern county officials favor developing what is under their feet for as long as they can.Juan Flores, a community organizer for the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, has called the decision “inexcusable and shameful”.“The board of supervisors’ vote to pass this ordinance shows they are willing to turn a blind eye to the chronic health problems, disastrous environmental impacts, and disruptions to already disadvantaged communities of color that adding tens of thousands of new wells would create,” Flores said in a statement, vowing to keep fighting.Mercedes Macias, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club who lives and works in Kern county, says advocates will begin pushing the state to crack down on the county.“By passing this ordinance, the board of supervisors has made clear that they are willing to turn their backs on our community in favor of propping up the oil industry – and it’s no exaggeration to say that people could die as a result,” she says, emphasizing that the environmental and health risks take a disproportionate toll on communities of color.On Wednesday, community and environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the ordinance in Kern county superior court, naming the county, the board of supervisors, the California Independent Petroleum Association and the Western States Petroleum Association and arguing that the environmental review conducted was inadequate. The groups also claim that the new ordinance will fast-track oil and gas projects and inhibit public participation and environmental assessments going into the future. Meanwhile, advocates are staking their hopes in part on a state bill that would ban new permits for fracking and several other methods of oil recovery and set stricter standards on how close wells can be from schools and homes. If passed, the bill would also create a program for oil and gas workers who are displaced, but so far the plan is scant on details.But state auditors have said that, at the current rate of reductions, California is not on track to hit its target. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has been outspoken on the issue but hesitant to intervene at the county level, or offer a clear plan for how to transition communities that are financially dependent on oil and gas.Most of the state’s focus, though, has been on reducing transportation emissions and the demand for fossil fuels, which has increased since 2013. The state’s housing crisis has pushed people to live farther from city centers, increasing commute times, and the market for quick deliveries and app-based rides has put more cars and trucks on the roads.Last year, in an attempt to reign in growing emissions from transportation, Newsom issued an executive order requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in the state after 2035 to be zero-emission, calling it the “most impactful step our state can take to fight climate change”.Melissa Hurtado, a state senator whose district covers parts of Kern county, agrees that more needs to be done. “Our climate change policies and goals have not been working instead they have created inequities in our most vulnerable communities,” she says. “The truth is climate change is here and we are in desperate need of a new vision on how to tackle the challenges of today, but also the challenges of tomorrow.”Elkind, from the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, says he would like to see the state plan for a more interventionist approach in places like Kern county.“If the state were really going to get serious about stopping oil and gas production, they would have to essentially step in and tell counties like Kern that we have to phase this out,” Elkind says, adding that, so far, there have not been big attempts to get in the oil industry’s way.“We need a managed, measured, multi-decade plan, with a clear signal that we are phasing things out,” he adds. “The state should be the ones to say we are phasing it out in California and the state should be the ones to make sure the transition is done as equitably, humanely, and economically sustainable as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa929691ea4e7ff0d20e3307e123b1cfd41defdc/0_121_2278_1367/master/2278.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=557cd8cc1cf18d2b5a69c55f4f40f1f4","title":"can you kick it the definitive womens football quiz","story":"Women’s football has seen its audience rise to a whopping 1.12 billion viewers – but are you one of them?

Playing with her local club from a young age, she knew a big move was inevitable if she wanted to play at the highest level.In fact, it was the young women in the national team, the Football Ferns, who inspired Moore the most.“I think because New Zealand is so remote from everywhere else, I idolised a lot of the girls from our national framework. They’re actually still there now, and I remember when I had my first tour with the Football Ferns and I’d had those players on my wall – then I was going to training with them for the first time.“Players like Abby Erceg, Ria Percival, Amber Hearn, Ali Riley – all those girls were influential because I saw them, and I was like: ‘I want to do that, I want to be in the Football Ferns environment, I want to follow in their footsteps.’”The first leg of her journey was to Germany, where she played first for FC Köln in the women’s Bundesliga during the 2017-18 season. A couple of seasons at Duisburg followed, including a bad injury just ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, before she signed with Liverpool, at the beginning of this season, where she is fitting right in.“Coming from New Zealand, we’re very carefree – we’re just living the life and quite chilled. So I think coming to Liverpool, it’s quite similar to home – you could say there’s a lot of banter between the girls, we get along quite well.”That said, it’s not always easy living so far from home.“I’m quite family-oriented, so that’s a really important thing for me. I regularly keep in contact with my mum and sisters, my grandma – I schedule in weekly video calls, because it’s so important to me. And being so far away, it’s important for me to keep those connections close, to be able to lean on when I need to.”When disaster struck and Moore tore her achilles while training in France ahead of the 2019 Women’s World Cup, she was lucky, she says, that her family was already travelling to Europe on the same day, and so they were present when she woke from surgery.Though Moore realises injury is “part of the game”, a tough time followed as she underwent rehabilitation in Christchurch, New Zealand, afterwards. However, it was in these difficult moments that she realised who the most important figures in her journey were. Her family, and in particular, her mum, who she describes as her “rock”, and says she is on the phone to straight away regardless of the 13-hour time difference, whenever she has a problem.She also hailed her physiotherapist, Tamsin, as a key figure in her recovery.“I couldn’t have done it without her, and I do think you notice in those sorts of times how important the people around you are – how much you can, and need to rely on them to get through it.”But Moore isn’t used to being confined to one place for too long. She loves travel and long journeys – in which she makes sure she always has some good music and a book with her when she’s on the road. But she is getting settled in Liverpool now and, as a big coffee drinker, can’t wait for normality to resume so she can explore some of the city’s cafes.Another thing Moore misses is playing in full stadiums. “The people make the atmosphere, and the people make the game, so to be able to play in a packed stadium again will be pretty cool,” she says.“It’s always nice to be able to play in front of people and hear them cheering behind you, but we know that it’s not possible right now and since coming here I have felt a lot of love.”In terms of where she wants to be next, there is only one destination, she says: “Anfield.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

The goalkeeper talks to Jen Offord about her journey to Liverpool and who’s been with her en routeAt just 22, goalkeeper Rylee Foster has already travelled much of the globe, having visited every continent except Africa. She’s played for Canada under-20s, and spent four years at West Virginia University, but Liverpool has always been her dream destination. With strong family ties to the city, it feels fitting to her that this is where she has started her professional career.“I don’t think I had a choice when I was born,” she says, “I supported Liverpool for as long as I can remember.”Foster’s paternal grandparents were born and raised in the Wavertree area of Liverpool and travelled to Canada after the second world war. Though her father was born in Canada, Foster says the connection to Liverpool never left.“It was something that was in a sense drilled into me as a young kid, watching the matches every weekend with my dad or my mum, and my sisters on the couch,” she says.Her grandparents were also key figures in her early footballing aspirations.“My grandparents used to come to my matches and there were always words of wisdom: ‘Just keep your elbows up and don’t let anyone take you down. If someone comes close just give them a little knock – whatever you’ve got to do to keep strong.’”After her beloved grandmother passed away in 2013, Foster had the words of the famous Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone tattooed on one of her biceps in memoriam. It was, she says, a reminder that her grandmother would always be with her.“But it also rooted me into my culture. I just wanted to have that reminder to keep going forward and keep representing my family, but also the Liverpool crest with as much pride as I could.“To be the first one to be able to return back to Liverpool and to have roots here to start something new and carry on the Foster name in the city is an honour.”Foster’s family is clearly as integral to her football journey as much as the physical one she has taken to be here, acting as her cheerleaders and support network.She started playing football around the age of five, when her father took her and her sisters to the local park. These are, she says, some of her fondest memories. But as well as starting her on her journey, her family gave so much and put everything else aside to make sure she was able to fulfil her potential.Not living close to a competitive training ground, her entire family would follow her for the hour-and-a-half journey to practice and back.“My dad would leave early to come and pick me up, my mum would take my sisters and they would miss time with their friends and do their homework in the car.”Given how close they are, and how meaningful her career move is to the entire family, it’s not ideal, says Foster, that they can’t be with her at the moment. Her sisters were able to visit during the year she has been in Liverpool, and her mother also came with her when she first signed with the club. Next, she really hopes her dad will be able to visit.“It’s been a dream for me to make that happen,” she says. “Just be at a match together, for him to see the Kop and be in that experience, that environment, would mean the world to me.”Although Foster hasn’t had much time with the club under Covid-free circumstances, having joined in January 2020, she’s already had a taste of the incredible fanbase Liverpool are known for.“The football culture here is amazing. We talk about the fans, but it’s not even that it’s a thing that they love, it’s like a religion, which is how I’ve felt all my life – so to be immersed in a culture like that is so fun and so cool.”“When I walk on to the pitch and hear You’ll Never Walk Alone, it kind of hits home a little bit more. It actually brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it.”Since she’s been in Liverpool, she’s been impressed by the food culture and lists Bold Street as one of her must-visit places. She’s also enjoyed travelling by foot to take in the historic buildings, particularly around the docks, as well as getting to know her fellow scousers.“If I’m wearing the kit in town it’s an automatic conversation. Other cities I’ve been in, they don’t really care to have that conversation, they kind of look at you and walk by, but people here want to get to know you and know where you’re from. I think it’s so cool to be able to make those connections.”Finally, of course, there’s Anfield itself, which is, in her opinion, “breathtaking”.Though it may have been chaotic at times, Foster is proud to have travelled so much, and is grateful for the opportunities football has given her.“When you’re going there for football you get a different feel for these countries, you don’t get the resort style stuff you get to see the inner cities and what the people are like – you can talk to the people and relate to them. I’m pretty lucky to be able to learn while being able to experience some of the greatest places in the world.”But that doesn’t mean she’s not keen to enjoy some leisurely travel too. She’s looking forward to seeing the Blue Lagoon in Iceland and surfing in Hawaii when things get back to normal. “I don’t think I’d be very good at surfing,” she ponders, “but I’ll try it.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

Though the 19-year-old’s career may have grown – like many others – from humble beginnings, she is well connected in the local football community, and counts Liverpool royalty Jamie Carragher as one of her confidants.“I think growing up Steven Gerrard was my idol and I always looked up to him,” she says. “But now, I speak to Jamie Carragher quite regularly – he’s my dad’s friend – and he gives me the best advice I’ve probably had in football.

Duggan was a huge source of inspiration to the young footballer, having attended the same youth club in Liverpool.Kearns started playing football at the age of four with her cousins in the garden, and joined a local team with her cousin. She trialled and signed for Liverpool at the age of eight, and worked her way through each of the age groups at the club before breaking through into the first team last year. Though, it could have been different for the midfielder.Female role models are important in this game, with the age-old adage: if you can’t see it, you can’t be it – and Kearns hopes to return the favour one day.“Knowing what Toni has done for me, if I can do that for other young girls, that’s amazing – it’s got me where I am today. So if I can help, I’d love to.”Another important female figure in her football journey is her grandmother, who she says she has successfully converted to the beautiful game.“Believe it or not, she never used to watch football,” Kearns says. “But now she’s starting to get into it more. She used to watch when it was just me, but now she’ll watch actual games on the TV.”Kearns’s grandma also fulfilled the role of backroom staff as well as fanbase, and would pick her up from school, get her ready and take her to training. Several times a week, whatever the weather, she was always ready to help.“If she’d not done that while my parents were at work, I wouldn’t be where I am today. I’m grateful for what she’s done for me.”Like many of her fellow Liverpudlians, Kearns is an avid football fan, as well as a player, and is part of what she thinks of as “one big family”.“I was watching football in the house before I even played it. I was going to Anfield, so I’ve been brought up into football and I think being a Liverpool fan, it makes you want to follow football more because of the passion and how big a club it is. It’s just unbelievable when you’re in the stadiums feeling it, home and away, how much it actually means to the fans watching the team.”In her free time, as well as hanging out with friends in the city, and particularly the Royal Albert Dock, Kearns is a regular in the stands at Anfield, and appreciates the role of fans both as a player and supporter.“I think for us, as the women’s team, when the fans are there you feel like you’ve got more players on the pitch. You feel privileged that they’ve come out to watch you and support you.”Kearns has big aspirations for her career, hoping to get Liverpool back into the Women’s Super League, and hopefully winning some trophies.When she’s on the road now, to the slightly less exotic locations of Charlton in south-east London, and Maiden Castle in Durham, you’ll most likely find her with best friend Jade Bailey on the team bus, and she takes her PlayStation 5 with her everywhere to “relax”, she says. She hopes there might be some longer journeys in the future, though.“There’s loads of places I’d like to play,” she says, quickly clarifying, “as an away team, though.”Anfield is the dream, she says, but she thinks Barcelona’s famous Nou Camp would be a “good experience”. And she’d like to experience the atmosphere at Ajax’s Johan Cruyff Arena.“I just think Ajax fans are brilliant,” she says of the Dutch Ereisie club.She’d also love to play at German Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund’s Westfalenstadion for the atmosphere and another familiar reason.“They sing You’ll Never Walk Alone, too,” she says, referencing Liverpool’s famous anthem. “I’d probably get goosebumps.”Expedia believes that travel, like football, is better experienced together.

The controversy concerns two retrospective planning applications by neighbouring farms to expand shooting ranges in the small borders village. One, at Over Cassock farm about five miles from Samye Ling, seeks to replace temporary buildings with a permanent structure while the other, at Clerkhill farm just two miles away, is to expand a shooting range, which was opened last March but closed eight months later in the absence of full planning approval.Both plans are opposed by the residents of Samye Ling on the basis of noise concerns and disruption to wildlife, as well as the use of one range for US Special Forces machine gun and rifle training.“Samye Ling has been here more than 50 years and we have always tried to be good Buddhists and especially to be good neighbours,” said Abbot Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche. “Now I hear the US forces will be training on a long-range high-velocity firing range within two kilometres of Samye Ling, on forestry land. We have a lot of very tame birds in Samye Ling it’s like a peaceful sanctuary for them. They feel safe here because nobody harms them and so there are a large number of little birds and bigger ones too. They are used to our peaceful environment and the sound of gunshots is terrifying for them all.”“This is about far more than noise – locals are rightly worried about safety and the militaristic nature of a development, which is completely inappropriate in a place of peace. There is not a shred of evidence it will bring economic benefits it is more likely to drive visitors away.”A spokesperson for the owner of Clerkhill farm and Gardner Guns, which operates the range, said it was essential to ersify income following Brexit and the pandemic, and the plans would generate jobs and income. Darren Bean of the Fifty Calibre Shooters Association, which operates the Over Cassock range, said: “The range operated for three years without the inhabitants of Samye Ling being aware of its existence: it is at the end of a valley facing away from all habitation.”A spokesperson for Dumfries and Galloway council said both applications would be considered by the planning applications committee .For Rinpoche, the plans are a final straw after years of growing traffic and noise pollution from commercial forestry and hunting, about which the Samye Ling community have never complained. Now they are calling on supporters to contact the council with their objections.“Thousands of people come here for courses and to meditate,” he said. “They all feel strongly opposed to this plan, and I have many friends from around the world who are determined to raise their voices in opposition to it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoWe are at the dawn of a new industrial revolution\u0026rsquo, says Eamon RyanChange in Bord Bia programme will compel members with \u0026euro50m turnover to set goalsHow car batteries are made and charged revealed as problematic in US studies"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: \u0026lsquoWithin hours it had grown another 8cm or so, curving to tighten its grip\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509931.1615721877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 niac recommends temporary deferral of astrazeneca vaccine rollout","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Ronan Glynn, deputy chief medical officer at the Department of Health, said NIAC was  acting on the precautionary principal, and pending receipt of further information. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recommended that the administration of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine be temporarily deferred from this morning.A statement from the deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the recommendation was made “following a report from the Norwegian Medicines Agency of four new reports of serious blood clotting events in adults after vaccination with Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca”.“It has not been concluded that there is any link between the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca and these cases. However, acting on the precautionary principle, and pending receipt of further information, the NIAC has recommended the temporary deferral of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca vaccination programme in Ireland. ”He said the NIAC would meet again on Sunday morning and issue a further statement after.Head of Niac Dr Karina Butler said the Norwegian medicine agency informed the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) of a “cluster of four serious, very rare, very serious clotting events not the kind of the usual clots in the legs but actual clots involving the brain or vessels that would normally be involved and in younger people,” she told the Brendan O’Connor show on RTÉ radio. “So, looking overall it was a number of these very small but very rare serious events in people that you might not otherwise expect it that raised a signal, a safety signal.” She said they hoped it was an overreaction anhoped to have a formal decision within the week.Norwegian health authorities said on Saturday that three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Thursday, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit. “We do not know if the cases are linked to the vaccine,” Sigurd Hortemo, a senior doctor at the Norwegian Medicines Agency told a news conference held jointly with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.All three iniduals were under the age of 50. The European medicine regulator, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would investigate the three incidents, Hortemo said. “They have very unusual symptoms: bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets,” Steinar Madsen, medical director at the Norwegian Medicines Agency told broadcaster NRK. “They are quite sick...We take this very seriously,” he said, adding that authorities had received notification of the cases on Saturday. AstraZeneca said an analysis of its safety data covering reported cases from over 17 million vaccine doses given had shown no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis or thrombocytopenia - having low levels of platelets.“In fact, the reported numbers of these types of events for Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca are not greater than the number that would have occurred naturally in the unvaccinated population,” a company spokeswoman said.Such trends or patterns were also not observed during clinical trials for the vaccine, she added.Before Denmark and Norway stopped their rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Austria stopped using a batch of the shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. The EMA said on Thursday the vaccine’s benefits outweighed its risks and that it could continue to be administered. Europe is struggling to speed up a vaccine rollout after delivery delays from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, even though new cases have spiked in some countries. - Additional reporting ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 160,729 had received their second dose.Some 173,435 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 278,326 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 117,815 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp627 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 300 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.A statement from the deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said:How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4509935.1615721483!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"garda inquiry into varadkar gp contract leak upgraded to formal investigation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar  apologised for his actions but said he had circulated the contract to encourage NAGP members to agree to it. Photograph:  Gareth ChaneyCollinsA preliminary Garda inquiry into the leaking of a confidential document by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has been upgraded to a formal investigation.The contract contained details of the deal the government had provisionally agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO). At the time, Dr Ó Tuathail was president of the National Association of GPs (NAGP), a rival organisation representing GPs that is now defunct.Detectives from the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), under the direction of Assistant Commissioner John O’Driscoll, had been conducting “preliminary inquiries” into whether an offence may have been committed under the Official Secrets Act.It is understood the status of the inquiry has now advanced to a formal Garda investigation.Previous statements from Garda Headquarters had said it had received correspondence on the issue, which was being assessed to determine if any Garda action was required.Mr Varadkar apologised for his actions in the Dáil but said he had not broken the law. He defended his actions by stating he had circulated the contract to encourage NAGP members to agree to it.Details around the leaking of the GP pay deal contract had first been reported by The Village Magazine in late October 2020.Detectives have already spoken to Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris about the matter, as he was minister for health at the time. Interviews have also been conducted with staff in the Department of Health.Mr Varadkar has said he has offered to meet with investigating gardaí to respond to any questions on the matter.The Official Secrets Act makes it an offence for “a public official” to leak documents of a sensitive nature.

Photograph: Fabio FrustaciEPAMost of Italy, including its capital Rome and its financial centre Milan, will have curbs on business and movement intensified from Monday as the government ramps up its efforts to stem a steady rise in coronavirus cases.The country will also be placed under a nationwide lockdown over the Easter weekend for the second year running, the government said on Friday.Italy, the first Western country hit hard by the pandemic, saw infections rise by 10 per cent this week compared with the week before, and officials have warned that the situation is deteriorating as new, highly contagious variants gain ground.In recent months the country has calibrated restrictions in its 20 regions according to a four-tier, colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) based on local infection levels which are revised every week.Under an order approved on Friday by health minister Roberto Speranza seven regions have been shifted into the toughest red zones, including Lombardy around Milan, and Lazio around Rome.Three other regions were already red, meaning half the country’s regions and most of its population will be under the most severe restrictions from Monday.In these areas schools and non-essential shops will be closed and Italians will only be allowed to leave their homes for work, health or emergency reasons.“I hope that this will be the last sacrifice asked of our citizens,” said Lombardy President Attilio Fontana. Italy has reported more than 100,000 deaths from the disease since discovering its first cases 13 months ago, the seventh highest toll worldwide.Friday saw another 380 deaths and almost 27,000 new cases.Easter clampdownThe whole country will become a red zone over Easter, from April 3rd-5th, Mario Draghi’s one-month old government ruled.It was not immediately clear how the new decree would affect churchgoers in the Catholic country. However, it was expected to be similar to provisions last Christmas when people were allowed to go to churches in their neighbourhoods.A Vatican source said Pope Francis’ Easter Eve Mass likely would be held a few hours earlier so that faithful could get home in time for Italy’s 10 pm curfew and that the pontiff’s Holy Week activities before Easter would be held in the Vatican with a limited number of participants.Unlike last year, Friday’s decree allows for limited visits to friends and relatives over the Easter holiday - for example to see elderly parents.Apart from Lazio and Lombardy, after the latest shifts in the colour-coded restrictions, the red regions will be Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Veneto and Piedmont in the north, Marche in the centre and Campania, Puglia and Molise in the south.All the other regions except the island of Sardinia will be orange, limiting movement between towns and restricting bars and restaurants to take-away service only.Sardinia, where infection rates are low, remains a white region with relatively modest curbs on daily life.As Italy tries to accelerate its anti-covid vaccination drive, Draghi said on Friday some 170,000 people per day are currently being inoculated and he aimed to “quickly” triple this number.These efforts got a boost later on Friday when the Italian medicines agency approved the use of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson’s single-dose vaccine, paving the way for the first shots to be delivered in a month.

Photograph: Martin BureauAFP via Getty ImagesThe World Health Organisation called on all countries to drop restrictions on the export of vaccines and vital components, as a rush for Covid-19 jabs puts pressure on global supply and a fresh wave of infections threatens Europe.Several countries around the world have imposed bans or restrictions on exports of doses and key vaccine ingredients amid a scramble for stock, causing logjams in complex international pharmaceutical supply chains that could slow progress to end the pandemic, the global health body warned.“Some countries have imposed legal restrictions on the export of critical supplies. This is putting lives at risk around the world. We call on all countries not to stockpile supplies that are needed urgently to ramp up production of vaccines,” WHO chief\u0026nbspTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference.“In a global pandemic no country can go it alone, we are all interdependent,” he added. “We cannot end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere.”US stockpileA ban on vaccine exports by the United States has led to 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine accumulating in an Ohio facility, and tens of millions more in a separate facility in Baltimore, the New York Times reported. The AstraZeneca vaccine is not yet approved for use in the United States, so cannot be used domestically.“We understand other governments may have reached out to the US government about donation of AstraZeneca doses, and we’ve asked the US government to give thoughtful consideration to these requests,” a spokesman for AstraZeneca said.The European Union is in talks with Washington in a bid to ease supply bottlenecks, a European Commission spokesman said on Friday, after US president Joe Biden said his country would only be prepared to share doses once his own population was served.The EU has exported a million doses to the US and more than 8 million to Britain since February, but has extended until June a requirement for permits for some vaccine exports that saw Italy block a shipment due to Australia last week.Glass vials, plastic components and raw materials used in vaccines are among the components in short supply due to the sudden surge in demand, according to the WHO.\u0026nbspPlanned vaccination campaigns across the EU have been hampered by steep cuts in expected deliveries from AstraZeneca, which is on course to supply only 30 million doses by the end of March rather than the more than 100 million that were initially expected.“I see efforts, but not ‘best efforts’,” European commissioner\u0026nbspThierry Breton wrote on social media, calling on the board of AstraZeneca “to exercise its fiduciary responsibility” to meet the company’s commitments.Third wavesThe shortfalls and uneven vaccination campaigns have piled public pressure on national governments across the bloc, amid concerns a third wave of infections is building in Germany and Italy, which is preparing a strict lockdown that will confine Italians to their homes for the Easter weekend to counter the surge in infections.There were concerns that the speed of vaccine rollout could be slowed as several European countries temporarily paused the use of two batches of AstraZeneca vaccines pending a review of reports of blood clots in patients.The WHO said there is no indication that vaccines caused such conditions, and that a certain number of cases would be expected when the jabs are given to so many people, because such conditions occur in the population.\u0026nbsp“More than 335 million doses have been administered globally so far, and no deaths have have been found to be caused by Covid-19 vaccines,” said Dr\u0026nbspAdhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief. “But at least 2.6 million people have been killed by the virus, and more will continue to die the longer it takes to distribute vaccines as rapidly and as equitably as possible.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view how andrew cuomo went from covid hero to pariah","story":"Suzanne Lynch on the fall from grace of New York State governor Andrew Cuomo, whose early handling of the pandemic won him praise but is now subject to increasing scrutiny, and whose declining fortunes have been worsened by accusations of sexual harassment.The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

Martin Fitzpatrick, head of music at English National Opera, compared it to the satirical BBC show W1A.“Come on, BBC Proms, what is this? A trailer for a new series of W1A? Classical music isn’t something to be embarrassed about. There is much about the Proms that is wonderful but you wouldn’t guess it from this advert,” Fitzpatrick tweeted.Aleksandra Myslek, a classically trained pianist and junior fellow at the Trinity Laban conservatoire, wrote: “Awful. Dear BBC, classical music is wonderful, inspiring, life saving, peace calling, educational, hypnotic, irreplaceable. Stop being embarrassed. Lots of young people share this view (while being well versed in other types of music).”Oliver Webber, professor at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, said: “Surely it’s possible to embrace variety and ersity without apologising for the core repertoire of the festival?”The advert is for two six-month placements, one as an event coordinator and another as an assistant publicist. It features a young BBC employee explaining: “The Proms showcases so many different music genres and styles, from House, Ibiza music, to sci-fi film music, to breakdancing music. So there really is something for everyone and you don’t necessarily have to have a background in classical music to work at the Proms.”She explains that she began her career at the Proms and progressed to a job working on the BBC Three show RuPaul’s Drag Race UK.Sarah Minns, the opera singer, wrote on Twitter: “This made me angry. It’s as if classical music is a dirty secret. BBC Proms, surround yourself with people who love the Proms for exactly what they were supposed to be. There are so many people passionate about classical music and not just wanting a step up at the BBC.”A second BBC employee in the video recalls that the “standout moment” of working on the Proms was dressing as an astronaut and jumping around on stage during a concert by Public Service Broadcasting, the indie rock band.Alan Davey, controller of Radio 3, defended the advert. Speaking at a conference for the Association of British Orchestras, Davey said: “This advert was about appealing to a wider range of people who might normally think about applying for jobs at the Proms. There are seasonal jobs there and every year we want to put a plea to as wide an audience as possible.“The advert is not saying classical music is dull, embarrassing or only for old people. What it says is that the BBC Proms is more than you think.“When we do things like the Ibiza evening, you get an audience who’ve never heard an orchestra before. Then they want to hear an orchestra again.”The Ibiza Prom took place in 2015 and was hosted by Pete Tong, the BBC DJ, featuring the Heritage Orchestra.Its inclusion in the season raised eyebrows, prompting Suzy Klein, the Radio 3 presenter, to attack the “self-elected snobs and scaremongers” who “want to ‘protect’ classical music, and high culture at large, from the onslaught of mass entertainment”.The Ibiza Prom became the most downloaded concert of the season.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"farmers bitter tate lyle sugars made britain packaging","story":"Farmers have accused the food giant Tate \u0026amp Lyle Sugars of misleading shoppers by putting a Made in Britain logo on its sugar grown in plantations around the world from Belize to Brazil.The American-owned company promotes its bags of white granulated pure cane sugar with a Union flag on its packaging, which states: “Made in the UK since 1878”.Foreign-grown sugar cane for the UK market is processed in local mills where it is pressed to extract juice. The juice is then crystalised into raw sugar for shipping to a London refinery, where impurities are removed from the sugar crystals.But questions are now being asked by farmers, who say it should be made clearer that the sugar is imported from abroad.Labelling laws were tightened up last year after it turned out some Lincolnshire sausages were made of meat from intensive pig farms overseas, but were processed in UK, sparking questions as to why the law does not appear to apply to sugar suppliers.The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has called for a fresh review of grocery products marketed with the British flag. It said foreign-grown produce should be banned from carrying a Made in Britain logo.Michael Sly, chairman of the NFU Sugar Board, said: “British farmers supply over 50 per cent of all sugar consumed in the UK, produced to the highest environmental standards.The Made in Britain logo this cane sugar carries may mislead shoppers into believing it is grown by our farmers.”Britons consume about 5,000 tonnes of sugar a day. British Sugar is the country’s leading sugar producer and its factories are supplied by about 3,000 sugar beet farmers in the UK. The average sugar beet travels just 28 miles from the farm to the factory.By contrast, the imposing Tate \u0026amp Lyle Sugars refinery on the banks of the River Thames in Silvertown, East London, processes sugar cane imported from around the world, with an annual capacity of 1.2m tonnes.It is the largest sugar refinery in Europe, importing sugar cane from Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Argentina and Guyana.Paul Kenward, managing director of British Sugar, which owns the rival Silver Spoon brand, supplied with sugar beet from UK growers, said: “I find it misleading that a product that is grown overseas, largely processed overseas, then imported to the UK, can be advertised on the pack as being made in Britain.”Farmers say they are already under threat after Brexit from raw sugar cane imports from countries with lower environmental and production standards. Ministers cut tariffs to zero for 260,000 tonnes of raw sugar cane imports at the start of the year, despite protests from farmers.Ministers say the move will support free trade talks, promote competition and support the UK\u0027s raw cane sugar refining capacity. A report by Greenpeace Unearthed, the organisation\u0027s investigation unit, last year estimated the zero tariffs would save Tate \u0026amp Lyle Sugars about £73m in just one year.The NFU says many overseas sugar cane plantations are permitted to use pesticides banned in the UK and the production methods can have adverse impacts on precious environments. The government did implement tougher rules on country of origin labelling last year to prevent consumers being misled, but the NFU says a new review is required.Tom Clarke, who grows sugar beet on his 1,000-acre family farm near Ely, in Cambridgeshire, said: “Sugar cane can’t grow in this country and so it can’t be British. This sugar travels thousands of miles and is treated in an industrial plant.”Mat Smith, who produces sugar beet for British Sugar on a 1,500-acre farm near Peterborough, in Cambridgeshire, said: “The customer will assume that it is British-produced, from the soil to the plate. It’s very frustrating.”The Tate \u0026amp Lyle sugar business was sold to the sugar cane processing giant American Sugar Refining in 2010 for about £210m. Tate \u0026amp Lyle Sugars sponsored the Conservative Party conference in 2017 and wrote a letter to its workforce before the EU referendum saying it backed Brexit.A Tate \u0026amp Lyle Sugars spokesperson said: “Our factories in East London have been making sugar and syrups for over 140 years, employing generations of local people in good quality jobs. Unfortunately, this is another attempt to undermine and belittle those factories and the 850 people that work in them.“It is no coincidence that this comes at a time when the UK is deciding how to correct the decades-long discrimination that cane refining faced in the EU, seeing it tightly restricted whilst the beet sugar industry benefitted from generous subsidies and deregulation. The company has previously dismissed it as a “complete fantasy” that it wanted to import cheap or poorly-produced sugar cane.A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: “Our sugar beet farmers provide a key harvest which is vitally important for UK sugar production, and we expect the origin of all British sugar to be labelled in a way which is clear to the consumer.“As part of the UK Global Tariff, the Government proposed a set volume of raw cane sugar to be imported tariff free to support this important UK industry while maintaining strong trading ties with developing countries.”   EndsMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national cyber force centre set north part governments integrated","story":"A new national cyber force centre will be the latest Government agency set up in the North, Boris Johnson has announced.There will be a cyber corridor across the north of England which will include the headquarters of the new National Cyber Force (NCF), the Prime Minister is set to reveal.The NCF was created last year to transform the UK\u0027s capacity to conduct targeted offensive cyber operations against terrorists, hostile states and criminal gangs. It brings together personnel from defence and intelligence agencies under one unified command for the first time.It is hoped that the proposal will drive growth in the digital, defence and technology sectors outside London and create new partnerships between Government, the sector and universities in the region.Mr Johnson is set to outline these plans to bolster Britain\u0027s cyber capability on Tuesday, when he will also present the findings of the Government\u0027s far-ranging review of foreign and defence policy.The Integrated Review - covering foreign, defence, security, and development policy - has been billed as the most significant overhaul of the UK\u0027s strategic posture since the Cold War.Part of its remit has been to consider how the armed forces need to adapt to the changing face of warfare, with a new focus on cyber and military.Ahead of his statement to the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said he will commit to take a full-spectrum approach to cyber in a bid to keep people safe and stay ahead of the UK\u0027s enemies.Cyber power is revolutionising the way we live our lives and fight our wars, just as air power did 100 years ago, said Mr Johnson.We need to build up our cyber capability so we can grasp the opportunities it presents while ensuring those who seek to use its powers to attack us and our way of life are thwarted at every turn.Our new, full-spectrum approach to cyber will transform our ability to protect our people, promote our interests around the world and make the lives of British people better every day.  The Government said Britain\u0027s adversaries are constantly finding new ways to exploit our weaknesses and gain advantage in cyberspace, so investment is needed to keep ahead of our enemies.The type of operations the NCF is able to carry out include interfering with a mobile phone to prevent a terrorist being able to communicate with their contacts helping to prevent cyberspace from being used as a global platform for serious crimes, including the sexual abuse of children and keeping UK military aircraft safe from targeting by weapons systems.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"astrazeneca vaccine should suspended ireland sayscountrys deputy","story":"Use of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine should be temporarily suspended, Ireland\u0027s deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said.Serious blood clotting has been recorded after inoculations in Norway.The Irish authorities have been pressing the pharmaceutical firm to speed up its supplies to the Republic.Dr Glynn said: This recommendation has been made following a report from the Norwegian Medicines Agency of four new reports of serious blood clotting events in adults after vaccination with Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.It has not been concluded that there is any link between the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca and these cases.However, acting on the precautionary principle, and pending receipt of further information, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recommended the temporary deferral of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca vaccination programme in Ireland.Several other European countries temporarily suspended AstraZeneca jabs following reports of people suffering blood clots.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) reported one person in Austria was diagnosed with blood clots and died 10 days after vaccination, but it stressed there is currently no indication that vaccination has caused these conditions.Another person was admitted to hospital in Austria with pulmonary embolism (blockage in arteries in the lungs) after being vaccinated, while one death involving a blood clot was reported in Denmark.A 50-year-old man is also thought to have died in Italy from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), while there has been an unconfirmed report of another death in Italy.Denmark, Norway and Iceland have said they are temporarily halting all AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the reports.Italy also followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning jabs from one particular batch of one million AstraZeneca vaccines, which was sent to 17 countries, after reports of a death.Ireland\u0027s governing Coalition has been under fire over the speed of its vaccination response.Around 600,000 doses of vaccine -

But, in a rare sign of unity in the EU’s capital, they are joined in apathy about the Conference on the Future of Europe.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, had called for EU-wide citizens debates on the bloc’s future in 2019. But the idea quickly became mired in inter-institutional squabbling, which has meant the overdue event ended up with no fewer than six presidents, rather than the single one originally planned.“The idea only made sense if its job was straightforward and simple,” said Andrew Duff, a former Liberal Democrat MEP and former chair of the Spinelli group of federalists.“What we have is a mess of pottage. There\u0027s no agreement within the institutions let alone between them about what the Conference is for - or its organisation, leadership, or budget.”“I believe this would be only one another eurofederalist exercise. No other outcome than “more Europe” expected,” said Jan Zahradil, a Czech MEP and  the former president of the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament.An EU diplomat said, “With so many presidents the Future of Europe looks more like the supreme Soviet than the liberal open society it’s meant to embody.Guy Verhofstadt , the European Parliament’s former Brexit coordinator, was expected to get the job leading the conference but, amid fears in Europe’s capitals that he is too federalist, the appointment was blocked.In the end, a bizarre compromise was found between MEPs, EU member states and the European Commission. The conference will be led by the presidents of the commission, council and parliament.It will also have an executive board made up of three representatives, led by another president, and four observers from each of the three EU institutions.Despite Mr Verhofstadt branding the conference a “bureaucratic circus”, he will lead the parliament’s delegation, which has not been confirmed because it is not gender balanced. .Enthusiasm for a pan-EU series of citizens’ assemblies has also been dimmed by the coronavirus pandemic.“It’s odd to have a carnival of navel gazing at the moment Europe is swamped by the British variant,” the diplomat said.On Wednesday, a deliberately low key signing ceremony of the joint declaration for the conference was held by the presidents of the three EU institutions in  Brussels.Divisions remain over the level of ambition for the conference with the European Parliament insisting that EU treaty change should be on the table, despite there being no appetite among many member states  for the torturous negotiations that would involve.A European Commission spokesman said the conference would reach beyond the “Brussels bubble” and reach the “silent majority” of EU citizens.“The Executive Board is only the governance part of the Conference. The Conference itself is primarily citizen-led,” he said.Alberto Alemanno, professor of EU law at the HEC business school in Paris, said the conference could still imbue the bloc with more democratic legitimacy and showed “boldness”.“Instead of obsessing with the Conference’s leadership and management, let’s recognise that this is the first attempt ever made to embrace a radical democratic innovation, such as citizen assemblies, into the EU decision-making,” he said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"little men brussels losing side history","story":"What do we think of when we think about Europe? Culture, cuisine – Brigitte Bardot, Gina Lollobrigida? Getting lucky with a sexy student on an Erasmus exchange? No one could deny that these wonderful things exist and that they’re a joy to the world. Regrettably, as the bureaucrats of the EU have been giving us grief for so long, when I think of Europe these days I think of self-important little men running round passing piddling laws and being rewarded handsomely for doing so. One of my favourite EU stories is the one about the procedure guidelines for the import and export of caramel – apparently they’re longer than the American Declaration of Independence.It’s funny when bureaucracy applies itself to confectionary – not so amusing, when it comes to a killer pandemic. Every week some cautionary incident takes place which reminds us why we were right to want to have nothing to do with this shower for one second longer than possible. Last week’s Public Service Warning came to us courtesy of the lying Eurocrat Charles Michel, when he claimed that Britain had imposed “an outright ban” on vaccine exports – later corrected by the EU Commission after a stern letter from Dominic Raab.Red faces all round – and I don’t just mean our old mate Jean-Claude after a thirst-quenching business brunch. France, historically one of the biggest bosses and beneficiaries of the Brussels gravy boat, has her own troubles, with Macron facing the fact that almost half the electorate believe that Marine Le Pen may win next year’s election.Ever since the founding of the EU, those involved saw themselves as the saviours of poor fragile Europe – great men of history, defining the fate of a continent. But increasingly, they’re being revealed as moral pygmies – the Little Big Men of the failed European dream, strutting about like a gang of expense-account Napoleons without even the uniform to recommend them.That’s not to say that only the EU suffers from the march of the Little Big Men (LBM). Look at Mark Drakeford, First Minister of Wales, who single-handedly has destroyed the stereotype of the Welsh as a roguish, lyrical people, with his love of lockdowns and insistence that baby food and sanitary towels were “non-essential” items. And that’s not to say that all Little Big Men are male – look at Nicola Sturgeon, the Joan of Arc of admin, who never saw a pint pot she didn’t want to penalise for not being metric.We have one of our own leading the Labour Party Keir Starmer, whose more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger mien reminds one of that teacher who wasn’t cross, just disappointed, but who might one day snap if the class continued to play the fool. There is a distinct “you won’t like me when I’m angry” feeling about the LBMs – but we don’t like them anyway, for being bossy bores, which takes away their bargaining power somewhat.But it’s mostly an EU thing. One of the characteristics of the LBM is that he finds it hard to accept his own limits, that he was born with such a low level of all the gifts – brains, beauty, wit – that they would never naturally propel him into the spotlight. Unable to accept this, he attaches himself to a project which gives him power over those more gifted. Everything great about Europe existed long before the EU it’s telling that their theme tune Ode to Joy was composed by Beethoven in 1824. Couldn’t this brave new EU world produce a new one?There is a large element of the LBM in the neurotic Remainers, clinging to their stinky old Strasbourg comfort blanket, which indicates that it is they – not we Brexiteers, happy to live in a small and dynamic nation – who want to be part of an empire. (To hear them speak, you’d think only Britain ever had one, whereas those “owned” by France and Belgium were far nastier – and we won’t even mention what Germany got up to.) But, somewhat pitiably, many LBMs went into politics because they wanted to make life better for people it’s a shame how so many end up as busybodies, seeking to corral and control any fellow citizen more daring than themselves.Oscar Wilde famously said: “We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars” the LBMs are made of stardust like the rest of us – but they are forever looking at the gutter, tut-tutting at the fag ends and wishing they could bring in littering laws like Singapore’s.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories should standing workington man not woke ington man","story":"West Cumbria is staggeringly beautiful. Not the chocolate box beauty of its near neighbour the Lake District but the rugged beauty of an unspoilt coastline, contrasted with industry like Sellafield. Despite this, it has its challenges. The infrastructure is appalling – the A595 connecting it with the county’s other industrial hub, Barrow, literally passes through a farmyard. In some areas broadband speeds are comparable to London in the 1990s. It has significant pockets of deprivation and should be top of the list of areas needing to be “levelled up”.At the last election it was “Workington Man” not “Wokeington Man” nor Extinction Rebellion who gave Boris Johnson the largest Conservative majority for a generation. This very same voter is now faced with the loss of 2,500 new jobs, as well as the estimated £100 million a year that would have been delivered by the mine to the local economy.I see no reason why Great Britain should “take the knee” on this issue to one of the world’s biggest polluters. We should never prioritise jobs in Pennsylvania over jobs in the North of England. Unlike the US, we should be proud that in June 2019, the UK was the first major economy to set a legally binding target to reach net zero by 2050. This commitment may, for many, justify stopping a new mine being opened in England, but they are wrong. The West Cumbria mine is net zero 2050 compliant and accords with UK green industrial commitments, including government commitments to no coal production beyond 2049.

We continue to do all we can to support her.”The British-Iranian dual national appeared in a Tehran court Sunday to face new charges of propaganda against the system, her lawyer said.The hearing has dashed hopes of family and supporters for a swift release of the 42-year-old, in a case that has heightened diplomatic tensions between London and Tehran.The hearing took place in a very calm and good atmosphere, in the presence of my client, her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told AFP, adding that the judgement would be handed down at a later and unspecified date.According to Kermani, she is now being prosecuted for propaganda against the system for having participated in a rally in front of the Iranian embassy in London in 2009.Given the evidence presented by the defence and the legal process, and the fact that my client has also served her previous sentence, I hope that she will be acquitted, the lawyer added.In London, her Member of Parliament Tulip Siddiq said that no verdict was given, but added that it should be delivered within a week.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained while on holiday in 2016 and convicted of plotting to overthrow the regime in Tehran - accusations she strenuously denied.The mother-of-one was working at the time as a project manager for Thomson Reuters Foundation, the media organisation\u0027s philanthropic wing.She has been under house arrest for months and had her ankle tag removed, giving her more freedom of movement and allowing her to visit relatives in Tehran.She completed her sentence on March 7.A day later, her husband, Richard, and their six-year-old daughter, Gabriella, held a vigil outside the Iranian embassy in central London demanding she be allowed home.He tried to deliver an Amnesty International petition signed by 160,000 supporters calling for his wife\u0027s release, but was turned away.Earlier this month, Richard Ratcliffe told the BBC her detention has the potential to drag on and on.Media in both the UK and Iran and Richard Ratcliffe have drawn a possible link between Nazanin\u0027s detention and a British debt dating back more than 40 years.The British government has previously admitted it owes Iran up to £300 million ($390 million), but both countries have denied any link with the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case.She has been temporarily released from Tehran\u0027s Evin prison and has been under house arrest since the spring due to the coronavirus outbreak.For four years, however, at Evin she spent time in solitary confinement in windowless cells, declared hunger strikes and had medical treatment withheld.While in prison, she suffered from lack of hygiene and even contemplated suicide, according to her husband.Iranian authorities have consistently denied that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was mistreated.On Friday, campaign group Redress handed a report to British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab which it said confirms the severity of the ill-treatment that Nazanin has suffered.The legal campaigners said that it considers that Iran\u0027s treatment of Nazanin constitutes torture.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"drive thru vaccination centres could","story":"NewsDrive-thru vaccination centres plan for millions to get jabs through car windowsEXCLUSIVE: The end of the Covid- pandemic could be in sight as drive-thru jabs are hailed a stunning success and calls are triggered to lt the lockdown fastermirrorShareCommentsByJohn SiddleNicola Small:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video coronavirus-headlines-on-march--,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

A pilot project saw , people receive the Covid jab in a single day – % more than in a clinic. And the GP who masterminded the scheme says he could have vaccinated , people in a single weekendhe had more supplies. Health bosses fear that unreliable vaccine supply could hamper any plans to scale up the scheme. But the UK was this week boosted by news that up to  million extra doses of the Covid vaccine will be made available in the coming weeks. It comes as:All over-s could have their first dose of the vaccine by Easter. every adult will be offered at least one jab by June . Sporting events such as the FA Cup Final and World Snooker Championship open up to crowds. Booster jabs to protect against iants could be available from August.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section The drive-through pilot in a car park near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, had a vaccination rate of almost five times the -a-day that medics can do in GP practices. Dr Richard West, senior partner at Woolpit Health Centre, came up with the idea for drive-through centres. He said: “We could be vaccinating millions of people a week using drive-throughs. If the Government really wants to crack on and get us back to normal, this is the way forward.” A handful of other drive-through vaccination centres are already operating across England, including in Kent, Hertfordshire and Warwickshire. There is currently no national framework in England but mass drive-throughs have been set up in Scotland and Wales. Patients have to park up for  minutes after their jab in case they suffer any side-effects. Richard Vautrey, from the British Medical Association, said: “Drive-through clinics are a good idea. Some GPs have used them for flu jabs. We should be running them for Covidwe can.” NHS England said: “Although we will continue to open more convenient vaccination centres as supply allows, it’s clear from our progress so far that the biggest factor in how quickly people can get a jab is the availability of supply.” New studies show that one dose of the vaccine may be enough to protect against the worst effects of the virusthe recipient was previously infected with Covid.  To test new crowd safety measures, the World Snooker Championship and the FA Cup final will be offered up as guinea pigs. The events – in April and May respectively – are set to go ahead with slimmed-down crowds to checkthey spread the disease.

A Covid- booster vaccine is also due to be rolled out in August or September to avoid another winter surge, top government vaccination adviser Prof Anthony Harnden said yesterday. So far, more than . million Brits have had their first dose of the vaccine and UK Covid deaths fell by % last week. One in three people also now live in a Covid-free zone. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out lting the lockdown early as scientic advisers fear a third wave.But Prof Robert Dingwall, from Nottingham Trent University, said: “The speed of the vaccine rollout and the solid evidence of its benefits means that we do not need to wait for five weeks between each step in the ­release programme.” As it stands, pubs and restaurants can only open for indoor dining on May  but the British Beer and Pub Association want the date brought forward to April.

Mr Amesbury, MP for Weaver Vale in Cheshire, said: “This is a milestone. Parents, carers and children have waited far too long to be able to buy school ­unorms at a price they can afford. “Any further delay, particularly in the Covid economic crisis, would hit parents when they can least afford it. We want to see this implemented in time for the new school year. “I am absolutely pro-school unorms but the current policy fails young people who can face isolation and even exclusion through not being able to afford the right clothes.

Officers from the politan Police were seen grabbing several women, leading them away in handcuffs and the force later said four people were arrested for public order and coronavirus regulation breaches.But there has been condemnation of the policing of the vigil, with Home Secretary Priti Patel seeking a full report on events. She described footage from the vigil as upsetting, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called on Commissioner Cressida Dick to consider her leadership of the force.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the scenes were unacceptable, tweeting: The police have a responsibility to enforce Covid laws but from images Iaposve seen itaposs clear the response was at times neither appropriate nor proportionate."},{"url":null,"title":"tories take 10 point lead","story":"NewsTories take  point lead over Labour in polls as vaccines hope gives boostEXCLUSIVE: Despite a series of U-turns and disastrous decisions during the coronavirus pandemic, our exclusive poll suggests the Tories are still favoured by the British public and Labour has more work to domirrorShareCommentsByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsDespite a mostly horric handling of the coronavirus crisis Boris Johnson is still well ahead \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Andthese results were repeated at a General Election the Tories would be ed with a  overall majority and  more MPs than Labour.Survation’s Carl Shoben said: “After perceived failures over PPE and test  trace the Government appears to be receiving a bounce related to the success of the vaccine rollout. “Labour has bet the house on challenging the Government’s competency on Covid. “The vaccine programme has left that strategy looking tired. Labour needs to focus on showing its dferent vision for the country.“ Sir Keir sought to exploit fury over the PM’s paltry one per cent pay offer to NHS staff tor the launch of his local election campaign last week. But Tory strategist Claire Pearsall said: “Kicking off a local campaign on a national issue is a mistake. “At local level people care about the three Ps - parking, planning and potholes.” Only  per cent of voters now think Sir Keir would make the best PM compared to Boris Johnson ’s  per cent while the PM’s favourability rating has gone up two points and the Labour leader down one.Four in ten voters approve of the Government’s performance, a rise of three points, but  per cent still give it the thumbs down. On May  there are  county councils up for grabs,  metropolitan boroughs,  unitary authorities,  district councils and  police commissioners because of postponed elections.On top of that London’s Sadiq Khan, Manchester’s Andy Burnham, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham, West Midlands Andy Street and Bristol’s Marvin Rees are up for re-election in mayor ballots cancelled in March . ANALYSIS by Nigel Nelson Decency oozes out of Keir Starmer’s every pore. He’s also great company. And there is no doubt he would be a safer pair of hands than the butter-fingered Boris Johnson. But he is also naturally cautious at a time when the nation cries out for a bold and radical vision of a post-Covid future.  And Labour MPs privately complain that Starmer is yet to reveal the magic touch needed in a successful political leader - the ability to inspire. Tony Blair had it and won three General Elections.Jeremy Corbyn lost two but still drew adoring crowds wherever he went.Starmer’s job now is not just to talk about how he would make the lives of British people better. But to show them exactly how he would do it.

Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has ordered an urgent investigation into homes and public buildings ­clad in a material known as K. They had been certied safe – but it has since emerged that fire checks were flawed. Whitehall officials have not identied which buildings are affected, but they could include homes, schools and hospitals. Kingspan, which makes K, withdrew safety warrants for the material last October after admitting “inaccuracies” in its fire tests. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section A small amount of K was used in Grenfell’s cladding. Mr Jenrick’s new safety investigation has stunned MPs, fire chiefs and councils. It follows the leasehold scandal, which has seen . million people living in flats with Grenfell-type cladding unable to sell their homes unless they pay for expensive renovations. One MP said: “We don’t know the full implications yet. But it’s huge.”And Labour housing spokesman Mike Amesbury added: “This revelation could add up to a second wave of the Grenfell tragedy fallout. It adds to the fear and confusion over fire safety across the country.”The Housing Department has issued an alert over the use of K and warns: “Fire safety professionals and buildings control bodies should review their records to check that any assessments carried out using these tests are identied and revisited.” An inquiry into the  Grenfell Tower blaze, which killed  people, has heard evidence that in a safety test in  a cladding system incorporating K burned “very ferociously”.

In August, Rumi was born after seven years of heartache and miscarriages. Having lost three babies, the pregnancy was especially agonising for Anita, who worked on the NHS frontline until four days before her due date, unsure whether she was putting her unborn baby in danger each time she walked into the surgery. With husband Nadir, a gastroenterologist, reassigned to work in intensive care during the pandemic, putting him face to face with Covid patients each day, the risk of exposure didn’t end when Anita came home. “Looking back, I don’t know how I did it,” says Anita, . “I lost lots of sleep over it and was very anxious. I didn’t enjoy a single day of the pregnancy because I felt so vulnerable.” Despite the risk, she felt obliged to keep turning up for work. “I had to do it for the NHS,” she says. “It’s not like other jobs – you can’t just walk away from your patients.” Anita was especially nervous as the impact of Covid- on unborn babies was unknown so the couple developed an elaborate routine to keep them all safe. “There was lots of news about NHS workers who were pregnant and lost their lives. It felt like World War Three,” she says. “When he came home from work my husband would go into the basement, take off his clothes, take a shower and keep his washing separate from ours. We were very aware of the risks of catching Covid. “The car steering wheel and gear stick needed to be wiped down after every use and we’d wear gloves when we were going shopping to prevent us catching it.” Anita had always known it might be tricky for her to conceive, after having a fibroid removed from her uterus aged  and being diagnosed with endometriosis at . Shortly after she got married in , she had her first miscarriage. “It was a missed miscarriage, so it was very early on and I never knew I was pregnant until it was over,” says Anita. Two years later she fell pregnant and in October , Nirvan was born. “I named him Nirvan because nirvana is a state of liberation and eternal bliss.”  But although Anita loved being a mum, she craved another baby. “I didn’t want my son to be an only child – I wanted him to have a friend, and someone to have after we’re gone, a family to leave behind,” she says. Anita and Nadir, who live in Birmingham, tried for two years to have another baby, but could not conceive. Then, in , they were thrilled to discover that Anita was pregnant. Sadly, at  weeks she miscarried. “I was devastated,” she says. “Although it wasn’t my fault, I felt a lot of guilt. “When you have a child and you want them to have a sibling, it’s dficult. “It’s so hard when they start asking for a baby brother or sister and you can’t give them one.” It was another two years before Anita became pregnant again. At  weeks, she had a scan to find out the baby’s gender but instead received the news there was no heartbeat. “While the sonographer was doing the ultrasound, she asked whether I’d had my  week scan,” she recalls. “I just knew it was going to be bad news.” “It’s a memory that will never leave me – it was so traumatic that I simply can’t get it out of my head.” Anita was devastated. “My world fell apart. My first thought was: ‘How am I going to tell my son ’ “He was waiting for a baby brother or sister, and now the baby wasn’t going to come.” Because she was  weeks pregnant, Anita had to give birth to the baby. “I was beside myself. I can’t tell you the pain I was in,” she says. After that crushing loss, Anita became depressed. “I was very unwell but I knew I had to pull myself together for my husband and son,” she says. “But the pain is always there somewhere. It’s like a stitch in your heart.” For two years, Anita underwent investigations to see what had caused her losses, but nothing was found. “If you don’t know the cause, then you never get closure,” she says. “As a clinician myself, it was very frustrating not to be able to find any medical reason for the miscarriage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum britains biggest family only","story":"NewsMum of Britains biggest family only wanted three kids -

The -year-old has  children between the ages of  months and  with husband Noel Radford, , making them Britain’s biggest family. Here, she talks about the organised chaos at home, how they remember her stillborn son, and why she’s ruled out having any more kids… Mother’s Day is a very special occasion for me, as it’s one of the few days of the year when I don’t have to do laundry. I love everything about having a big family, except the fact I need to load up our kg washing machine at least twice a day. We have  children and four dogs living in our house in Morecambe, Lancashire. Our eldest two, Chris and Sophie, have moved out and we also have our angel baby, Alfie, who sadly passed away. Alfie [who was stillborn in ] is very much a part of the family, and I’ll always count myself a mother of  because of that. We talk about him to keep his memory alive and we put flowers on his grave. My kids always make Mother’s Day as relaxing as possible. I get a day off of doing chores, breakfast in bed and loads of homemade cards. I have received a lot of those over the years and I keep them all. I’m quite sentimental like that. People think it’s strange having so many children, but to us it’s normal. We only actually wanted three children, but we loved what each child brought into our lives. About  years ago we bought a house. We are so fortunate we were able to buy one, as we have a successful family pie business. It has  bedrooms and we said, “Let’s just fill them all!” So that’s what we did – and more! A few of them have to share, but they enjoy it so much that when it’s their turn to get their own room once somebody has moved out, they’re often reluctant. We didn’t have kids expecting somebody  to pay for them. We’re the providers, and we want that attitude to rub off onto our children.  We’re grateful the online side of the business took off in the pandemic, after we had to briefly close the shop. It can be a lot of pressure for us to feed so many mouths, but we’ve been lucky. What we’re most rich in is love. The last year has brought us even closer as a family. Full house Our house is full of happy, laughing kids, playing and having fun. I crave peace and quiet some days, but mostly thrive off the busy lestyle. Lockdown has been bearable, because with so many of us, it’s impossible to be bored. The only thing I’ve found hard is homeschooling, as that’s a full-time job in itself. We have so many dferent ages that I’m having to teach loads of curriculums. The big kids help, but they have their own work and jobs to do. I was so relieved when they announced schools were reopening in England. The bedtime routines went out the window in lockdown, but that’s just le.  There’s always something going on in our house, or a celebration – we’ve had  kids’ birthdays over the years. We try to make each one special. I have to start planning the Christmas presents in August. It takes a lot of organisation to do anything for the family. Going on a plane for a holiday involves so much counting. It’s chaotic but worth it. When we’re out in public we get such a positive reaction. People ask how I manage. A few criticise us on social media, saying we can’t have enough love and attention to give them all, but we do. I don’t have favourites. I love them all equally, and the children never question that. It’s easy to distribute our time, and actually our children don’t want us around them constantly. They all have lovely bonds with their siblings and rarely argue. They are protective of each other, but luckily nobody has ever encountered any trouble. Their friends are more just amazed by it and say our house is quieter than they’d expect. It all seems to flow. In general we’re very laid-back and the children are well behaved. It’s not my style to be telling them off all the time.

Peaceful gatherings were held in Glasgow, Nottingham, Bristol and where this evening in honour of the -year-old marketing executive, who was found dead this week. However, police were accused of aposmanhandlingapos women at the event in Clapham Common, London, after hundreds turned up in defiance of police objections. Despite this, most of the events held across the country took place without any violence. Hundreds gathered to lay flowers and light candles for Ms Everard in Bristol, where officers avoided interfering with the crowd.  Police were praised on social media for allowing the vigil to go ahead. At least  people attended the event in Nottingham city centre, with just two officers spotted among the crowd, according to NottinghamshireLive. These officers also did not attempt to intervene in the event. A peaceful event also took place in Birmingham, where more than  people gathered despite police objections due to coronavirus rules.  According to Mail Online, one woman told the crowd: The police have prevented this, but despite that we have still come out in a pretty decent number. I think we should all be really proud of the fact that we have stood our ground anyway. One of the reasons I am here today is not just to acknowledge the tragic, awful thing that happened to Sarah, but also the countless women who are going to be dying because of the system. In Edinburgh, Scotland, people paid tribute to Ms Everard outside the Scottish Parliament, while others carried signs saying aposPolice donapost protect us. She was killed by a copapos."},{"url":null,"title":"dave ginger tomcat finally reunited","story":"NewsDave the ginger tomcat finally reunited with his owner after ten years missingMatt Simonds helped reunite a cat with his owner after he took the animal, which visited his home in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire, to the vet after becoming concerned about his flea infestationmirrorShareCommentsByMatthew DreschKim Horton:,  MAR NewsDave the cat has finally been reunited with his owner\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

I tried everything I could to find him, putting posters up and looking for him. “When he never came back we just hoped he was being looked after and was safe. “Not long ago I video called my son so we had a family reunion. “We are having him tested now for his thyroid and that now as he is so frail, but all he needs is the cosy le with us at home.

She refused to name the royal who had the conversation with Harry, , but said it would be damaging to the person who raised it. Harry told Oprah off camera that his grandparents, the Queen and Prince Philip, did not make the comment. He said he is never going to share more about the conversation about Archieaposs skin colour. The Palace said recollections may y. What really went on between Meghan and Kate   In late , reports claimed Meghan made her future sister-in-law Kate Middleton cry during a bridesmaidsapos dress fitting days before the former Suits actress wed Harry. Meghan told Oprah that the reports were wrong and that the reverse happened, claiming Kate was upset about something about flower girl dresses and made her cry. The American duchess said Kate owned it and apologised, bringing her flowers and a note afterwards. Meghan added that the  reports were a turning point. She said everyone in the institution knew that wasnapost true and she hoped Kate would have wanted that to be corrected, adding she is a good person. However, a source told the Times that Kate did leave the dress fitting in tears and the next day took flowers to Nottingham Cottage, where Harry and Meghan were living at the time, on the grounds of Kensington Palace. The source claimed Meghan slammed the door in Kateaposs face. Did Palace deny help for Meghan  Explaining how she had suicidal thoughts, the duchess said she went to the institution and said she needed to go somewhere to get help. But, she claims, she was told that I couldnapost, that it wouldnapost be good for the institution. She claims the Palaceaposs human resources department also refused to help because she was not a paid employee of the institution. Harry has told of his mental health struggles in the past and how he needed therapy to work through the grief he holds over his mum Princess Dianaaposs death. Did Meghan and Harry have a secret wedding   Meghan claimed to Oprah that she and Harry had a secret wedding three days before the royal wedding at St Georgeaposs Chapel, Windsor Castle. She said it was just the two of us in our back yard with the Archbishop of Canterbury and no-one knows about the ceremony at Nottingham Cottage. She added: We called the Archbishop and we just said, aposLook, this thing, this spectacle is for the world but we want our union between usapos. A spokesman for the Archbishop declined to comment.But source within the Church of England and those working for the Sussexes told thethat it was a personal and private exchange of vows and not a legal marriage as Meghan claimed.One of the sources said: “They exchanged their vows before the Archbishop in a personal, private ceremony but their official marriage was very much on the day of the royal wedding.” Will Archie be a prince   Meghan suggested her toddler son Archie, who turns two in May, was denied his birthright title of prince because he is mixed race. Any decision not to make Archie Mountbatten-Windsor a prince would go against convention, mum Meghan claimed. The duchess shared her upset at the idea of the first member of colour in this family, not being titled in the same way that other grandchildren would be. Itaposs not their right to take it away, she added. But Archie, who is seventh in line to the throne and turns two in May, is not yet entitled to be an HRH or a prince due to rules set out more than  years ago by King George V. Because of the Queenaposs long reign and extended family - her great-grandchildren - Archie is too far removed from the throne to be a prince. But he will be entitled to be an HRH or a prince when the Prince of Wales accedes to the throne and he becomes a grandchild of the monarch. When did Megxit planning begin  In late , amid reports of rows and rts, Harry, Meghan and Archie left the UK for a waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island in Canada. In January , the couple announced they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals to become financially independent but would still support the Queen. Harry insisted during the interview: Iaposve never blindsided my grandmother. I have too much respect for her. Meghan added: So I remember when you talked to her several times about this [Megxit] over... Harry interjected: aposTwo years.apos It would suggest the pair began planning to leave the family in . Did Meghan Google Harry   The duchess claimed she was naive about what royal le would be like, saying she didnapost know she had to curtsy for the Queen and was taught by Sarah Ferguson moments before meeting the Queen for the first time in . She told Oprah she had never done any internet searches on her future husband when they first started dating. Many viewers wrote on social media that they found it hard to believe that Meghan didnapost do any research. Meghan said during the interview: Thank God, I didnapost know a lot about the family. Thank God, I hadnapost researched. I wouldaposve been so in my head about it.Meghanaposs childhood friend Ninaki Priddy told the Daily Mail that Meghan was a massive fan of the royals growing up and when she was an actress.The pair visited Buckingham Palace together in  when they were in their teens. Ms Priddy said: I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with [her first husband] Trevor [Engelson] she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month. I can’t remember exactly when this was, but she was married to Trevor and starring in Suits. I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries - films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea. Did royals take Meghanaposs passport away from her   Meghan also claimed her passport was taken from her by the royals and she didnapost see it again until she moved back to the US. It is alleged she went on at least  trips abroad while a senior royal. She told Oprah: “You couldn’t just go. You couldn’t. I mean, you have to understand, as well, when I joined that family, that was the last time, until we came here, that I saw my passport, my driver’s licence, my keys. All that gets turned over. I didn’t see any of that any more.”Royal sources told the Sun that Meghan’s passport had to be kept safe so it didnapost fall into the wrong hands.It would still have been used by her for her holidays abroad, the sources added.

The allegations involve two senior members of staff who claimed that they were bullied by the duchess. Another former employee allegedly claimed they had been ­“humiliated” by Meghan. The Palace has launched an inquiry.  The news follows the explosive revelations made in Harry and Meghanaposs TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, where the couple spoke of the hardship they had endured and explained why they had decided to step back as senior royals.During the interview Meghan said she had been left feeling suicidal, and claimed racist comments were made to Harry about the potential skin colour of the coupleaposs then unborn child Archie. The couple claimed a Royal Family member had expressed concerns over how dark their sonaposs skin might be. Oprah revealed afterwards that Harry had stressed “it was not his grandmother or grandfather who were part of those conversations”. Responding to the bullying claims, a spokesman for the Sussexes previously said the couple have been the victims of a “calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation”.  The bullying complaint reportedly claimed Meghan “drove two personal assistants out of the household and was ­undermining the confidence of a third staff member”, according to The Times. The alleged behaviour is said to have led to members of staff quitting their jobs - with other members of staff saying they were often left terried amid disagreements in the royal household. Meghan - who is currently expecting her second child - hit back at the claims and accused royals of perpetuating hoods. Meghan Markleaposs spokesperson has said of the bullying claims: The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma.

A source close to Eugenie says that as her cousin Harry and his we moved to the US, the Princess and her husband Jack Brooksbank have remained close friends with the couple.

We were going for lunch at Royal Lodge... where other members of the family live, specically Andrew and Fergie, and Eugenie and Beatrice would spend a lot of time there. Eugenie and I had known each other before I knew Harry, so that was comfortable and it turned out the Queen was finishing a church service in Windsor and so she was going to be at the house.

Along with many practical considerations, the emotional toll it takes can be overwhelming, creating a sense of grief that can be painful to confront. “Your parents are the people who knew you first, they know your history, they know all the stories about you,” says Claire Hewson. “They love you unconditionally. “When they’re gone, when that’s gone, and they’re not around, it’s a struggle.” Coping can depend on many things. The support you have from those around you, and the plans already laid in place. “I was lucky. My mother was a fantastic organiser,” says Claire, , a call centre manager from London. “She organised her funeral with the local Co-op Funeralcare – her coffin, the car she wanted, and even the flowers she wanted. “All I had to do was the music. Everything  was arranged and paid for. I will always be grateful to my mum for doing that. I wouldn’t have known what to choose.” Coping with loss The last couple of years have been ‘challenging and horrible’ for Claire, who lost her father, Bob, to cancer in May , and her mum, Eileen, who died suddenly in June , whilst in hospital being treated for an ongoing liver issue. “It just felt like the rug had been pulled from underneath me. No-one tells you about death or what it feels like to lose someone. There’s still a stigma when it comes to talking about it.” And yet, while she lost them both within a short period, her experience with each was quite dferent. “Dad was in a hospice so we were going in every day, and the nurses were amazing, telling us what to look out for,” says Claire. “Every day we went in, not knowing ‘will it be today’ ” Claire was still coming to terms with losing her father when her mum died.  “It was dferent dealing with each death. With dad, it’s like I knew he was gone, I saw his body. Mum’s death was sudden, so I never got to say goodbye, and that really does mess with your brain, there’s no finality. Planning ahead The fact that her mum had sorted out her funeral was a blessing. “When my mum’s sister died it was traumatic for everyone trying to arrange the funeral and sort the money out. Mum saw this unfolding and didn’t want that for me. “She said she didn’t want me to have to worry about anything with her funeral. She went to Co-op Funeralcare and had a chat and chose what she wanted. She said they were very pleasant, and it was easy to do. “I will always be grateful to mum for that because I wasn’t in my right mind and I’d urge anybody to do that. It makes that part so much easier for those left behind. All I had to do was phone them up and give them her details and that was it. It took the pressure off, and people don’t always have the money.” "},{"url":null,"title":"we must keep monarchy change","story":"NewsopinionKeep the monarchy but change the royal family every week by a National LotteryOne week an East End family could be royal, and the next week a pagan who lives in a wigwam in DevonmirrorShareCommentsByMark Steel:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionThe Queen with the Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle are royal now - but what about next week  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As I’ve argued before, we must keep the monarchy, but the Royal Family should change every week and be chosen by a National Lottery. With my system, instead of awkward battles and secret arguments, Nicholas Witchell would come on the  o’clock news to say: “Queen Eileen has issued a strongly worded statement, saying, ‘Prince Terry was out of order – it weren’t his place to remove security from our Kevin but you can’t tell him. He’s always been the bleedin’ same, the muppet.’” And that would be the end of it. Because all their dficulties come from the fact that the royals have no idea about normal le. In her interview, Meghan Markle said she couldn’t follow the strict palace rules, but no one normal could understand them. To the Palace, it makes sense that, “If one is a Duchess in the third drawing room, and the second son to the reigning monarch should enter, one’s valet must place a porcupine within one’s corset, and cry, ‘May I humbly prickle within, your highness and custodian of the holy ginger beer.’” But the lottery method would make the royals accessible. One week, an old family from East London would be royal, so the National Anthem would be a pub singalong, and go, “It’s a giggle being Queen, Though the palace needs a clean, And I’ve chucked out all the corgis ’cos I don’t know where they’ve been.”  The next week, a -year-old from South London would be king, so the anthem would be a rap that went: “God save the king, for I ain’t seen anyting’, like them crown jewels, dat is massive bling, big up myself, ’cos I is ruler of the Commonwealth.” The monarch is head of the Church of England, so the church would be the religion of that week’s lottery winner.  Some weeks it would be a Christian, but the next week it might be a pagan who lives in a wigwam in Devon. So that week, vicars across England would have to change their name to something like Spirit of the Wind, who would say: “Now let us chant our first hymn, number , Um Oo Oo Aaa, bring me peace and a box of chickpeas.”  Instead of shooting parties, each week at Sandringham there would be a Call of Duty computer game party.

Patsy Stevenson was one of four people who were held by police when officers clashed with women at the bandstand on Clapham Common, south London, on Saturday evening. A planned vigil in honour of the -year-old was cancelled following pressure from the force but hundreds of woman gathered at the sight. Images of Patsy being held down and arrested by police went viral on social media as Commissioner Cressida Dick comes under pressure to resign. Patsy said she went down to the gathering to apossupport every single woman who cannot walk down the street by themselves because of the fear of menapos. Were you at the vigil and witnessed first hand what happened  Email mirrornews@mirror  As hundreds defied an earlier warning, officers grabbed and dragged away women stood within the and detained other mourners during running scuffles. Patsy told Counterfire: The fact that the police turned up was just disgraceful because before then it was a peaceful protest. I was arrested by police for aposstanding thereapos. Iaposm ft  and I weigh nothing and several police were on my back trying to arrest me. They arrested me, put me in handcuffs and dragged me away and I was surrounded by  police officers. Patsy said she was taken into the police van where she was told she would be free to goshe gave the officers her details so she could be fined for breaking coronavirus rules. She is now calling for people to meet outside Parliament Square on Sunday at pm so they can be aposseen and heardapos. The arrests came after many refused request to leave as police tried to disperse the crowd, just hours after a politan Police officer charged with kidnapping and murdering Ms Everard, , appeared in court for the first time. The force said the gathering was illegal due to Englandaposs coronavirus lockdown rules, but it was facing heavy criticism from Mayor Sadiq Khan and Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and other politicians following the clashes. Lib Dems leader Sir Ed Davey led calls for Commissioner Dame Cressida Dickaposs resignation, while Mr Khan said he was in contact with her and was “urgently seeking an explanation”.  Officers were slammed for the way they handled the gathering and for the earlier refusal to allow a vigil to take place given promises it would be Covid-secure. Scotland Yard later defending the actions of officers, saying officers were placed in a position where enforcement was necessary. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: Hundreds of people were packed tightly together, posing a very real risk of easily transmitting Covid-. Police must act for peopleaposs safety, this is the only responsible thing to do. The pandemic is not over and gatherings of people from right across London and beyond, are still not safe. Those who gathered were spoken to by officers on a number of occasions and over an extended period of time. We repeatedly encouraged those who were there to comply with the law and leave. Regrettably, a small minority of people began chanting at officers, pushing and throwing items. Reclaim These Streets, which organised the original vigil, said it had been threatened with £, fines and criminal prosecutionthey event went ahead, and called it off after an unsuccessful High Court challenge on Friday. Despite the threat of fines, vigils in Birmingham, Glasgow, Bristol and a number of other cities went ahead without incident. After the ugly scenes in London, Home Secretary Priti Patel wrote on Twitter: “Some of the footage circulating online from the vigil in Clapham is upsetting. I have asked the politan Police for a full report on what happened.  “My thoughts remain with Sarah’s family and friends at this terrible time.” In a letter to the Commissioner, Lib Dems leader Sir Ed wrote: “The scenes this evening of the policing of the Clapham Common vigil in memory of Sarah Everard are utterly disgraceful and shame the politan Police. “The vigil this evening was a peaceful one brought together in the most horric of circumstances. “Across the country, countless women have told their own painful stories of harassment and abuse. Your officers should have been standing in solidarity with those on Clapham Common tonight not being ordered to disrupt this display of grief and peaceful protest. “This was a complete abject tactical and moral failure on the part of the Police.

Tensions escalated as speakers made statements about police and officers began to ask people to go home. At around .pm, police were booed as an officer, heard speaking on the live stream, walked onto the bandstand and told the women leading the gathering: Nobody here is socially distanced and weaposre in the middle of a pandemic. Weaposre asking people to go home. The crowd then began chanting where is Sarah , shame on you and f*** the police as night fell on the gathering, which highlighted the hurt and outrage following the -year-old marketing executiveaposs death.  Police moved in to disperse the crowd, forming a human barrier around the bandstand. The live stream showed a heated stand-off between an officer and a group of women, with the officer telling them: This is no longer a vigil, it’s an unlawful gathering. You’re going to get more police offers coming up here. Chants of f*** the police and police go home erupted a short time later. Police officers shouted at the crowd to move back from the bandstand, and asked people not to step on flowers left at the memorial. There were sporadic clashes with people being detained.  There were huge cheers and shouts of run as one person ran off while being marched to a police van, which had been sprayed with anti-police graffiti. Officers were verbally abused and, earlier, it appeared they were pelted with an object. As the scenes unfolded, police said the gathering was “unsafe” and urged people to go home. Earlier, police looked on as women banged drums and chanted sisters, united, weaposll never be defeated at the bandstand, which had been transformed into a memorial with a sea of flowers, cards, candles and other tributes. Some held placards reading “we will not be silenced”, and “she was just walking home”.  It came shortly after Kate Middleton left flowers at the memorial during an unannounced, solo visit. There was fury over the way the gathering and the planned vigil were handled by the Met Police. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: The scenes in Clapham this evening are deeply disturbing. Women came together to mourn Sarah Everard – they should have been able to do so peacefully.” He added: “I share their anger and upset at how this has been handled. This was not the way to police this protest. London Mayor Mr Khan tweeted: “The scenes from Clapham Common are unacceptable. The police have a responsibility to enforce Covid laws but from images I’ve seen it’s clear the response was at times neither appropriate nor proportionate.”  He said he was “in contact” with politan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick, and was “urgently seeking an explanation”. Labour MP Ms Ribeiro-Addy wrote: This could have been the socially distanced vigil the community needed to remember Sarah and all the women who have lost their lives to violence. We knew what was going to happenthe event was shut down. She added: I know Lambeth Borough officers made efforts to compromise with the organisers but were overruled from high up. Theyaposll be left to deal with the fallout of this and the further burden it places on already strained community relationships. Very disappointing from Scotland Yard. Liberal Democrats deputy leader Daisy Cooper described the scenes as disgusting and completely avoidable. She wrote: After the court case yesterday, the High Court left the door open for the MET police to engage with the organisers to agree a peaceful, socially distant vigil. They refused and did this instead. Lib Dems MP Wera Hobhouse added: Is this really st century Britain  What is our police doing  Whatever has happened to policing for the community on behalf of the community   Labouraposs Sarah Owen added: No one can see these scenes and think that this has been handled anything but badly by @metpoliceuk. It could and should have been so dferent. Charlotte Nichols, shadow minister for women and equalities, tweeted: If @metpoliceuk had put the resources into assisting @ReclaimTS to hold the covid-secure vigil originally planned that they put into stopping any collective show of grief and solidarity , weaposd all be in a better place. MP Steve Baker, a Conservative backbencher who has campaigned for a faster loosening of coronavirus restrictions than planned by the Government, described events in Clapham as unspeakable scenes. He tweeted: You need to change lockdown law now @BorisJohnson. Gracie Bradley, interim director of human rights group Liberty, said: “Police were given the choice on how to approach this protest. They could have worked with organisers to ensure people could collectively grieve and protest a lack of protection.  “But instead they chose aggressive interventions that put people’s health at risk and led to chaos and distress. “The true architect of this disaster is the Home Secretary, who has relentlessly demonised protesters and refused to support a protest exemption to the lockdown rules. “She has undermined a vital pillar of democracy in the process, and pitched police against the public by encouraging aggressive enforcement against those who take to the streets to dissent.” Ms Everardaposs disappearance on March  and death has sparked public outrage and serious discussions about violence against women and personal safety. Reclaim These Streets had planned to hold a vigil at the bandstand, saying it had initially been given the ok from the Met Police. The group said the police later did an about-face, saying the event would be illegal and the organiser could face huge fines and criminal prosecutionit went ahead.  Instead, Reclaim These Streets encouraged people to attend virtual events on Saturday evening and shine a light, a candle, a torch, a phone on their doorsteps to remember Sarah Everard and all the women affected by and lost to violence. A police officer placed a candle on the doorstep of No in Downing Street. A minuteaposs silence was held and candles were lit during the online vigil hosted by Feminists of London, with television presenter Sandi Toksvig calling for Ms Everardaposs death to be a turning point where ending violence finally becomes a political priority. Mandu Reid, the leader of the Womenaposs Equality Party, echoed these sentiments, adding: The way to truly honour Sarah and every other woman weaposve lost is to demand that politicians of all stripes treat violence against women and girls as a political and policing priority. A fundraiser set up by Reclaim These Streets for womenaposs charitable causes passed its target of £, on Saturday evening. People gathered in Glasgow, Birmingham, Bristol and Nottingham despite the threat of fines. More than  people defied a police request to stay away from a Birmingham city centre vigil to remember Sarah Everard.

She was hoping to raise a staggering  millionfrom strangers, but her fundraising page was removed after collecting only about £.

It is said the coupleaposs combined personal wealth could be close to £ million after the value of their Los Angeles-area mansion, which has nine bedrooms and  bathrooms, nearly tripled within months.

A Tehran judge will decide whether she should face new propaganda charges just seven days after her previous five-year term for spying – a charge she has always denied – ended. Husband Richard Ratclfe said tonight: “The uncertainty is torturous, we’re talking open-ended detention. It leaves her fearing she’ll never get out. “The fear is not being taken back to normal prison, the fear is being taken back to torture.” Aid worker Nazanin, who has dual British Iranian citizenship, was held in Tehran in  during a visit to her parents with daughter Gabriella.

This week, Nazanin told independent investigators she was threatened with execution and the torture of her family. She also said she was chained and blindfolded in prison – and suffered sensory and sleep deprivation. And she said she was interrogated for nine hours at a time in solitary and bombarded with bright lights and blaring TVs. Richard says Nazanin, who spent a week in a psychiatric hospital chained to the bed in , was even left suicidal. She was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.  Richard said: “At points she has felt suicidal and thought the only way to protect her family was to no longer be here. She can’t control her anxiety. She wakes up in the night with uncontrollable pains and a really fast heartbeat. “I don’t think the British government has done nearly a good enough job protecting her or the others from torture or trauma.” Richard has asked for Britain’s ambassador, Rob Macaire, to accompany Nazanin in court and believes she is a “bargaining chip” in a £million dispute between the UK and Iran.

Hopefully I can stay there now.“It was a bit of a strange time as obviously I thought I was going out on loan.“My confidence had fallen and I wasn’t playing as well as I should have been.I wasn’t hitting the standards I set myself.“I was just wanting games and there were a few teams interested in me, including Thistle.“I just wanted to play and get back to where I should have been which I feel I have ed to now. I am feeling good and I just want to keep it going.“I just worked hard in training and ended up getting back in the squad at Morton.“Football is mad sometimes how it works.”McDaid admits the delay in restarting Leagues One and Two worked out well for him and he hopes to continue his good form against Arbroath today at Dens Park.He said: “It worked out well for me.“If it had been a short time before they restarted, I would have been away. Instead, I stayed here training.“The date was pushed back and I continued training with Dundee and eventually got myself back in the squad. I still have another year at the club so I always wanted to stay.“I just wanted to get games but when I started training better, I regained a bit of confidence and I was training really well.“I started thinking: ‘Maybe I can stay and help the team here instead of having to go where#.“Maybe I just had a dip in form # nothing really changed # but it has obviously turned for me and I am doing what I am capable of.”McDaid had a successful time under current Partick boss Ian McCall while at Ayr United, winning League One and reaching the Premiership play-offs.However, the winger says there has been no contact from his former boss over the cancelled loan move.“No, as he understands that I am a Dundee player and I will be here next year,” said McDaid.“Obviously I want to stay here and play # which I am doing now # rather than go out.”Now back in contention for a starting spot at Dundee, McDaid is keen to help the side pick up points in a “massive week” for their season.He has good memories of facing today’s opponents Arbroath at Dens last season from grabbing both goals in a - win in October .He’d like to repeat that feat but also has an eye on Tuesday’s clash with Ayr and a trip to Alloa coming on Friday night.McDaid added: “It is a massive week for the club.“We got a point at Morton with a much better second half and then I came in against Inverness and we picked up a good win.“Saturdaywasn’t a great game from both teams but in the second half we played really well and had enough chances to win the game.“We are playing well so we have to try to get maximum points out of these gameswe can.”On his double against the Red Lichties last season, he added: “That’s always in the back of my mind when we play Arbroath.“Even when I was at Ayr, we won a few times against them.“So hopefully I can do the same today, win the game and get three points.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The revenge of Tutties Neuk as Arbroath head for Dundee and how good is Benjamin Siegrist \" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – The revenge of Tutties Neuk as Arbroath head for Dundee and how good is Benjamin Siegrist # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street--dundee-fc-arbroath-dundee-united embed # secretEfCTDySbd\" data-secret\"EfCTDySbd\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\" vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-300x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-620x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-940x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/HEALTH-Coronavirus-09074353_38161852-e1615311800566-300x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"home school survey parents give us their verdict on remote learning","story":"Home learning will be over today for most children, with all primary school pupils back in class from Monday.

I hope they go and do it.”If the relative size of each club in a final had anything to do with the result, Sunderland would stroll Sunday’s match.Mellon accepts that.But the United boss doesn’t believe there will be much between the teams on the pitch, despite a huge resource gap.“When you see the Stadium of Light and their fan base then Sunderland are massive,” he said.“I would say though when I was at Tranmere we didn’t half have our days in the sunshine against Sunderland.“We always gave them tough games but they are a massive club with a great tradition. They are right up there with the biggest clubs, in terms of fan base and grounds, etc.“It will be a good game and I don’t think there will be much between the teams.

Currently, only people aged - with underlying health conditions # including chronic respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cystic fibrosis and severe asthma # are prioritised.Martina argues that a condition such as asthma cannot be measured and someone#s mild asthma one day can be severe the following day.She said: #The government categories people with asthma and it shouldn#t be the case.#They are saying only people with severe asthma # people who have been in the hospital in the past  months and those on very high doses of steroid tablets # should be eligible to be prioritised.#As a charity, we think this is very wrong because asthma can never be quantied as a condition.#Someone who has very mild symptoms today can wake up with an asthma attack tomorrow # so how can you define #severe# #That#s why we#re calling on the government to vaccinate all asthmatics as a priority # we#re all at risk.#Martina says that since all asthma suffers were asked to shield during the pandemic, they should also all be prioritised and vaccinated early.She said: #People lost their jobs because they were shielding.#And now that there is a vaccine for them to have and they would be able to go out, get some fresh air and do the things they love, they cannot.#As a charity, we#re trying to echo asthma sufferers# voices.#The outcry has been huge, our phones have been busy and our pages have been filled with messages # people are desperate for help.#Martina said she has been very careful during the ongoing pandemic and has been #following all the advice and doing all the right things#.She said: #I#m very anxious # I thought that since I#m struggling to breathe, I should be able to get the support that I need and I#m not getting it.#I don#t know where  I should go for help.#Martina also thinks that since the government encourages every asthma sufferer to get a flu jab every winter, they should also enable all of them to have the Covid vaccination ASAP.According to the current advice published on the NHS website, %C%including%emphysema%and%bronchitis\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noopener noreferrer\"the flu vaccine is offered free on the NHS to anyone with a serious long-term health condition, including respiratory conditions, such as asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , including emphysema and bronchitis.The severity of asthma # apart from needing a steroid inhaler or tablets # isn#t specied.Martina said: #The Scottish Government encourages asthmatics to get the flu jab.#Why do they say asthmatics need to take the flu vaccine because they#re at risk but the Covid vaccine isn#t for them #It just doesn#t make sense.#There are medical reports saying people with asthma are more likely to be critical when they have Covid and they can even die from it.#Health Secretary Jeane Freeman commented on the issue during yesterday#s coronavirus update.She said: #As an asthma sufferer myself, I understand very well some of the anxieties that fellow sufferers have around this.#But, as a health secretary, it#s my job to pay really close attention to what clinical experts and vaccination experts tell me, which is where the JCVI advice comes from, but also, the advice in addition to that from our clinical advisors # people like Jason , like DCMOdoctors Dr Steedman and Dr Caesar.#So I understand the anxieties, but it is right that as a politician I don#t override clinical advice.#What I do know is that our clinicians and JCVI are constantly looking at the data and the evidence and other evidence that comes out the way that it is presented to them # not only from the vaccination companies themselves, but other data that comes forward to review whether or not they believe at any point that they should change their guidance or amend it in any way.#Restrictions easing this week mean people are now able to gather in larger groups when meeting outdoors in Scotland.Up to four adults from two households will be able to meet outside after new rules came into force across mainland Scotland and some islands.Previously, two adults from two households were able to meet outdoors.Further changes now in force include allowing people aged  to  to meet in groups of up to four from up to four households.Outdoor, non-contact sports for adults in groups of up to  are able to restart.Some areas in Scotland: Orkney, Shetland, Skye and much of the Inner Hebrides, remain under Level  restrictions.There, up to six adults from two households, and six people aged - from six households, can meet outdoors.Ms Freeman said: “All of these changes are focussed on enhancing people’s wellbeing and together they represent gradual but important steps towards greater normality.”Ms Freeman also confirmed that a national minute’s silence will be held on March , the anniversary of lockdown.The latest figures show  deaths from coronavirus and  positive tests were recorded in the past  hours.It brings the death toll under this measure – of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous  days – to ,.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland’s progress in vaccinations, falling coronavirus cases and a reduction in deaths and hospital admissions from the virus, had enabled the “modest…but important” changes.Ms Sturgeon said: “They will, I hope, help people’s health and wellbeing, by enabling group exercise, and allowing for a bit more social interaction.“They will also, I hope, let children see more of their friends, and exercise and play a bit more normally.”She also warned of the need for caution in easing lockdown to avoid the virus running out of control.Further changes are planned for Scotland on Monday as more pupilsto school.All pupils will be back in primary schools full-time, with theof P-P with in-class learning restarting for more secondary school students.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58414515-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58414515-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58414515-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/03/2.58414515-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"aberdeen couple to appear on bbc game show the wall","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remA couple from Aberdeen is set to appear on BBC One#s The Wall this weekend.Sam and Louise, who have been together for  years and married for five, put their knowledge to the test after taking part in the popular game show, with their episode due to air tonight.Hosted by EastEnders star Danny Dyer, the show is the ultimate game of strategy, knowledge and luck.Sam and Louise were required to take on three rounds that test their general knowledge and trust in each other.Sam, a practice manager for a local optician, is originally from India but has been living in Scotland for  years.

region.There are  fewer primary pupils from the year before, and it is the third year that overall primary pupil numbers have fallen.The report said this may be on the back of fewer houses being built across the region for families to move into.It adds: #The impacts of the Covid- pandemic and Brexit may also be a factor, with families being prompted to make big decisions about how and where they live.#The forecasts currently indicate that by  rolls will have increased to , primary pupils and , secondary pupils.#The increase is around  fewer primary pupils and  fewer secondary pupils than predicted in the  based forecasts.#Many schools are expected to be over capacity by the next year, with some either meeting capacity, or nearly at capacity.Meldrum Academy is anticipated to reach % of capacity, while Kemnay Academy, which is already % over capacity, could rise to %Mearns Academy could reach %, Portlethen Academy % and Banchory Academy %.Mintlaw Academy is also forecast to reach

and Kennethmont at %.The report, which will be discussed by councillors at next week#s meeting, states: #In Formartine, currently only Meldrum Academy is operating at capacity. Reconfiguration work is planned for  to increase capacity in the short term, while assessments continue regarding requirements for longer-term provision.#By , Balmedie School and Foveran School are forecast to be over capacity. Work continues on a South Formartine Assessment to ensure appropriate provision is delivered for schools in the Ellon to Blackdog corridor.#Within Garioch, Kemnay Academy is currently the only school overcapacity. Some internal reconfiguration works carried out in the last year increased the capacity to  pupils.#The academy has a working capacity of  when the non linked classrooms are taken into account.#The provision of offering P pupils from Kinellar to attend either Kemnay Academy or Inverurie Academy continues for the   session and may continue to be offered again in future years as a method of curtailing pupil numbers in the short term.#It adds: #Mearns Academy is currently operating in excess of capacity, with the roll forecast to increase. Discussions have been underway with the school management team to identy appropriate options to reconfigure spaces as a short term solution.#The building was designed with the ability to be extended to  pupils in the future. Portlethen Academy is predicted to exceed capacity in , although this is currently impacted by a large number placing requests from outwith Aberdeenshire.#The extension to Hillside School has been delivered, which has increased the capacity of the school to  pupils.#Team teaching approaches and the use of general-purpose spaces as classrooms will continue until pupil numbers

In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them. After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care. Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Once again, the group excelled, taking the tally for the month to beyond , miles.The Camanachd Association ran a competition on the final day of the month – whoever ran the furthest would be rewarded with a Scotland replica top from association partners Macronstore Highland.Aberdeen University player Joe Folan set the early pace, clocking up . miles at am. But Paul Ross put in an impressive . miles an hour later and must have thought he had wrapped it up when checking the group#s Strava leader board in the evening.Joe had one eye on the prize too though and snuck out for a . mile run at .pm to pip Paul to top of the leader board.Derek Keir, Camanachd Association chief executive officer, said: #We were delighted so many people joined us in staying active this January.#The positive impact being active has on your physical and mental health cannot be overstated.A key component of our strategy is to engage shinty communities. It was especially pleasing to see non-shinty players join our Strava group and help to get us to Barcelona and back.#The Camanachd Association also raised more than £ for the Scottish Association for Mental Heath through the event."},{"url":null,"title":"staying active while home schooling","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"look out for nuthatches in argyll this spring","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin.

Finding a permanent solution might not seem pressing to some of us, while travel restrictions remain in place, but it is causing havoc for the businesses which depend on the route daily.Hopefully pressure from the affected business owners, many based in Kintyre, who are now making their voices heard, will result in a quicker solution.When thingsto normal, the people of Campbeltown are looking forward to welcoming visitors to the most improved place in Scotland, but visitors need to be able to get here."},{"url":null,"title":"letters february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It really will make a dference to our environment and is something that can be done easily on our daily walks.I would also like to say a big thank you to Jimmy Robertson, the bin man who contacted me and donated his litter-picker, bags and gloves. It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"postponed new year competition played in brutal conditions","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, we live in a world which increasingly believes that to disagree is to hate.Could it be that to disagree might in some circumstances actually be the manestation of love If a child searching for meaning and identity and love has chosen a path of destruction through heroin, for example, would a parent be loving to blindly affirm him Could disagreement be love The apostle Paul wrote this to Timothy, a young pastor: #And the Lord#s servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert. Saint Kieran#s also goes into Castlehill in Campbeltown this is a paper exercise as Saint Kieran#s no longer has pupils and is mothballed.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGONew Post OfficeCampbeltown’s Meadows scheme is to get its own post office in the early summer.Post Office Counters plans to open a community post office in Ralston Road in late May or early June.Post Office Counters has already secured premises for the office which will be open for around  hours a week but the chairwoman of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancy Smith, said she would prefer a new post office in the town centre.Since the main post office moved from Longrow to the Co-op supermarket last summer, the town centre has not had a post office.Mrs Smith said: #I#m pleased that there is going to be another outlet for people, but unless people have got a car it#s only going to be suitable for people in the Meadows scheme.#She added: #The community council has always pushed for a post office in the centre of the town.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide. Even now, many of my constituents are paying primum prices for snail#s pace broadband speeds.That#s why £, is being invested in a Tackling Digital Exclusion Top-Up Fund # to support people, businesses and communities to access improved digital connections for social and commercial opportunities supporting communities and in some cases iniduals that are missing out on national programmes due to logistics and economies of scale.While this budget is not perfect and there will be challenges ahead as we start to recover from the ongoing global pandemic this is a massive step in the correct direction.Now my constituents across the Kintyre and the Islands ward will quite rightly want to see action, not more talking.So that means more help for our small businesses, improving our digital connectivity and substantial improvements to our roads which in so many areas are sadly approaching the point of no .Six years ago, I had a sudden and le-changing stroke. I’m not alone in this: stroke strikes every five minutes in the UK, and around . million survivors are living with its devastating effects.Despite this, research into stroke is severely underfunded. Just one per cent of the total UK public and third sector health research spend goes towards stroke research.The Stroke Association has launched a unique opportunity for stroke survivors and those who care for stroke survivors to have our say on the future of stroke research. Partnered with the James Lind Alliance, the charity will find out what matters to us most so research can make the biggest dference to our lives.With such limited funds for stroke research, worsened by the Covid- pandemic, it#s vital that we come together and make our voices heard.If you#re a stroke survivor, or you care for or work with someone affected by stroke, join me and speak up for stroke.Visit www.stroke.org.uk jla by March ."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They are asking meit will take residents getting hurt before action is taken.#At the council budget we, as a council, put huge additional resources into infrastructure, in particular roads spending, so now there should be no more excuses and delays.#Skipness residents must be listened to and fit-for-purpose long-term work must be done.##The B is in dire condition and is causing increasing concern for residents and delivery services,# said Councillor Anne Horn.#I raised this issue again at MAKI area committee and the head of service advised the meeting that the repairs are prioritised for the next financial year. He also advised that residents will be notied of plans and progress for the roadworks.#This repair requires urgency and I will be urging officers to expedite the work without delay.#WEST KINTYRE:Applications for grants from this year#s first round of funding from the West Kintyre Community Council Wind Farm Trust are currently being accepted.Grants may be available for capital or revenue funding to support projects, groups, halls, charities and churches within the West Kintyre Community Council area, ranging from Whitehouse in the north to Kilkenzie in the south.Advice, details and application forms are available from convener Margaret Pratt via email at margaretpratt@btinternetThe closing date for receipt of applications is Wednesday March , and the disbursement meeting will take place virtually on Monday April .CARRADALE:Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis seeking Kintyre residents# views on the planned replacement of a submarine electricity cable between Carradale and Arran.The energy company is planning to install a  kilovoltcable which will run from Port na Cuile, Carradale to Balliekine on Arran.It comes after a routine inspection in August  of the two kV submarine cables providing electricity to Arran revealed the north cable, which runs from Port Crannaich in Carradale to Balliekine, was in poor condition with signicant damage to the protective armour # probably caused by contact with rocks.The armour of the cable to the south was intact so no further action was required.Following an assessment by engineers, SSEN decided to replace the north cable because a repair would be challenging and more costly due to its deep-water location and the extent of the damage observed.In order to gather opinions and answer any questions about its replacement plans, SSEN#s submarine cable team will be holding a pre-application consultation in the form of a series of four hourly online sessions between pm and pm on Thursday March .To register for the event, email submarinecables@sseAs well as seeking views on the project, SSEN is also looking for comments and opinions on its  #  investment programme."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 12 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Mr Wilson is trying to muddy the waters there.Whilst Mr Wilson is correct that Scotland cannot have debt , Scotland does have deficit, and the reason we know this is because the SNP-run Scottish Government tells us so in the annual Government Revenue and Expenditure, Scotlandbut Mr Wilson contradicts himself by going on to say that Scotland has a #notional debt# . Scotland has no debt. Scotland cannot have debt. Mr Wilson needs to realise that debt and deficit are two dferent things.With regard to HS, yes, Scotland pays a two per cent share of the total cost but will receive approximately . per cent back in Barnett consequentials. THAT is a very good deal for Scotland. London#s Crossrail  Not a single penny for that will be paid for by Scotland.Mr Wilson goes on to say that there is no #prohibition on independence votes#. Another error from him. Section  of The Scotland Act , the act which allowed us to have a devolved assembly and to which the then Scottish Office signed up, lays down the exact process required. We need permission from HMGov.Oh, and the notion that Scotland can abrogate the Treaty Of Union is also wrong.

Will that go to the social work department and will they get the same level of support as they do now No thought seems to have been given to the effect on the mental health of the employees # what support will be available and what budget will it come from How can the expenditure of a quarter of a million pounds be justied when the council is struggling for money and how long will it take to save this amount compared with the partial funding for Kintyre Recycling Limited It is shameful that only two of our local councillors are against vulnerable people being thrown on the scrap-heap when all three should be supporting their constituents.I am pleased to support the new business group set up to campaign for a quick and permanent solution for the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A.It’s now seven months since the landslide closed the A last summer. That should have been a wake-up call for the SNP Government, but all we#ve had since then is a failed attempt to protect the Old Military Road from landslides and talk of taking  years to solve the problem.This is just not good enough. We need urgent action now.Last week#s Courier letters page didn#t offer much hope. The SNP only wrote about independence, not the real issues facing us, such as the Rest and Be Thankful.The SNP Government should be concentrating on fixing the Rest and Be Thankful and recovering from the Covid pandemic, not spending its time plotting about independence.This Mother#s Day, school feeding charity Mary#s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary#s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world#s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary#s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That#s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary#s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother#s Day.

This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks.

That is a tough place to be in.The first occasion, He told them to go out again into deeper water , on the second occasion,it was to cast the net on the right side of the boat.

Ms Sturgeon dealt with that rather questionable issue with self-restraint.Prior to and after this matter Ms Sturgeon calmly and clearly answered questions put to her for seven hours. Her patience must have been sorely tried when ious members of the committee repeatedly asked the same questions of the First Minister. All were dealt with politely and efficiently.Eileen Michael, Ralston.WHAT ABOUT THE WESTMINSTER MESS YET another article from Iain Macwhirter on the Alex Salmond Nicola Sturgeon issue. May I suggest to Mr Macwhirter that other subjects he might have devoted his column to include the pound. million which was spent on Downing Street refurbishments, the pound,-plus legal expenses paid to Sir Philip Rutnam regarding claims of bullying by Priti Patelor the fact that the SNP welcomed , new members to its ranks within two days of Ms Sturgeon giving evidence to the Holyrood committee.Ruth Marr, Stirling.ALL ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC DEFICITREADERS must be well aware by now that Dr Gerald Edwards detests the independence movement, directing his fire mainly at the SNP which,any of his invective is to be taken seriously, would have to be aiming to create an independent state in which it would govern unopposed.He explains todaythat for independence to be credible Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP must demonstrate higher standards than other parties and be \"beyond reproach\". What a load of utter tripe. The credible case for independence has nothing to do with Nicola Sturgeon or the SNP and everything to do with the democratic deficit which denies the Scottish nation political self-determination.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WE NEED SO MUCH BETTERNO, Gavin Ferguson , Nicola Sturgeon is not being ripped down over a ldquoprocedural anomaly ndashyou can call misleading parliament and the people of Scotland an ldquoanomaly. She is being ripped down as this is the culmination of a disgraceful term in power where she has trashed virtually every aspect of Scottish le. Only the judiciary and civil service were left and she has now trashed them also.The pandemic and the Salmond Sturgeon affair have, conveniently for this regime, placed on the back-burner, her woeful record on education: why not publish the OECD report now as opposed to June on Police Scotland, a poundm black hole on GP surgeries close on the highest drug deaths in Europe on child hunger on homelessness, on vanity projects such as Prestwick and BiFab costing taxpayers more than pound million, on ferries unable to be completed and at triple cost on a new hospital lying empty on the named person scheme and on and on and on. All of these, as indeed confirmed my Ms Sturgeon in September , are of lesser importance than independence.This is a regime where every aspect of our lives has been sacriced on the altar of separation because destruction of the UK is the priority. We need, we demand so much better than this. That Scotland has been so damaged is a disgrace and I earnestly hope ldquothe people of Scotland will ensure the cancer of nationalism is damaged beyond repair in May. Nationalists clearly are content with a sub-standard government, the rest of us are not.Douglas Cowe, Newmachar.NO BREXIT CATASTROPHE YETAFTER all the hyperbole from the SNP of clf edge, catastrophe and disasterswe left the EU, it is reassuring to know and see that the wider UK Government has secured enough vaccines for all of us in the UK and we now see clear signs the vaccine is gaining the upper hand against the virus since leaving the EU, also that the US-imposed % tarf imposed on Scotch whisky while being part of the EU, which cost our industry pound million in business, has been lted as a consequence of being outside the EU tarf wars.It seems we are better off outside the tent.Contrast this with the vitriol between which SNP First Minister told the most least lies and the fancul claims by SNP propspective candidate Toni Giugliano that we can double our pensions with SNP, it is clear that while the party and Nicola Sturgeon can certainly talk, the UK takes action.As an ex-EU Remainer\" I am still waiting for the prophesied \"clf edge catastrophe\", but so far, so good, so lets get on with it.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.CHANCE TO REVAMP EDUCATIONWITH every crisis comes an opportunity.The pandemic has disrupted the educational progress of our primary and secondary pupils, the proper remedy for which is for them all to repeat the whole year to ensure that they proceed to the next stage properly prepared and equipped to handle the demands of the careers they hope and wish to pursue. Robert Frazerwas right to point out that there would be a blockage in the school systemmy proposalwere not refined to counteract that dficulty.What I would be proposing and had not clearly explained in my initial submission is that primary education would become an eight-year cycle, each new intake being inducted into a pre-primary year before entering upon primary one.That would mean primary pupils going to secondary one year later than they do now and, of course, leaving secondary one year on from the age they do now Primary schools would need extra staff, extra finance and more accommodation in the form of huts to service this change .What would the kids do in the pre-primary stage  Well, the groundwork for their future educational progress would be laid.They would be drilled properly in their times tables and they would be shown the importance of proper spelling. However, that year would also give them taster courses in the wonders of the night sky, the identication of trees from their leaves and birds from their appearance and song.There would be a gentle introduction to the cultural stories which infuse our literature from Greek, Roman ,Norse and Christian mythologies.They could also be exposed to the work of the great composers and artists during that year before embarking upon the curriculum supposedly designated to prepare them for advancing onwards and upwards to secondary level and beyond.Let us hope our politicians do not lose this opportunity to revamp our educational system and to ensure that those whose progress has been impaired by the pandemic do not suffer as a consequence.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.STAYCATION ARTICLE WAS MISLEADINGYOUR article on staycation prices which was headlined across the front page ldquoThe great Scottish summer staycation RIP OFFwas as misleading as it was irresponsible.The figures quoted are quite right ndash tourism contributes a signicant amount to the Scottish economy, yet only three holiday providers were cited. Of those, two were found to have signicantly increased prices for periods of high demand. While this is nothing new and both companies admitted to the policy, neither of those companies is Scottish, Hoseasons being based in Lowestoft and Havenin Hemel Hempstead. The one Scottish business quoted said it is not increasing prices.The headline across pages four and fiveincluded hotels in the alleged ldquopandemic profiteering, but no example was given. As the owner of a small hotel in Argyll, I am acutely aware that the leisure and tourism industry is on its knees, however, like the owners of Dalriada Luxury Lodges, and for the same reasons, we do not intend to increase our tarf this season.Articles such as this could do much damage to our industry.Christine Stevenson, Cairnbaan Hotel, Lochgilphead.LICENSE THE CATSI AGREE with Ron McKayand Anne Shackleton that dog licences should be reintroduced. I would also like to see cat owners having to have a licence for their furry friends. So many cats are let out on their own to defecate in other peoples gardens.

Among them was Mary A. Carson, the editor of the Womens Topic pages in this newspaper since , whose nom de plume was Jean Kelvin.ldquoWe have walked along those devastated streets, she subsequently wrote, ldquocrunching all the time over littered glass speedily being swept into the gutters. We have seen those shattered modest homes. If one looked for it, no doubt there was the lighter side ndash two children dancing unconcernedly on a novel stage, the cleared and windowless frontage of a shop and the incongruous, those odd personal items standing still intact before gaping walls.Carsons article appeared  years ago, on Monday, March , , in the aftermath of the Clydeside Blitz. Clydebank and parts of Glasgow had been bombed on the nights of the th, a Thursday, and th, Friday. It has been said of the first night, when the planes, some  of them, arrived in three waves between pm on the Thursday and . the following morning, that you could hear the explosions in Bridge of Allan, in Stirlingshire you could see the fiery glow in the night sky as far away as rural Aberdeenshire.ldquoWe have seen\", Carson continued, \"weary-eyed firemen, strained-looking wardens, tired soldiers about their business among the debris. We have seen a delicate, white-haired lady have to be firmly restrained from going to help them, and when warned of the havoc in her lovely home, refuse to be concerned.One sight in particular remained with her: huddles of people standing beside bedding laid out on the pavement. ldquoThose women and men everywhere with their pathetic little cases and bundles those patient evacuees at the rest centres, waiting to be shepherded to this place, or the next place, it did not matter where.Since the previous September, Scottish people had been reading of the catastrophic damage visited upon towns and cities in England by the Luftwaffe. London was first bombed on September , when  people were killed the capital was then bombed for  consecutive nights.What followed was \"a winter of horror, death, demoralisation ndash and heroism\". Coventry was devastated on November -  people died. Then came Birmingham, Bristol, Southampton, Sheffield, Liverpool, Manchester, Cardf, Portsmouth and Hull, as the Luftwaffe focused its attention on key provincial cities and industrial centres and, eventually, ports.Aberdeen had already been targeted, and was on its way to being ldquoScotlandrsquos front-line town. Thirty-four people were killed there on July . The enemy planes arrival over Aberdeen was for a time so regular that a remark would do the rounds: \"Its just about time for Jerry\".Glasgow had been attacked, too, in July and September. A young female shop assistant in the city said she had seen a German plane ldquolike a speck in the sky, dropping a bomb. ldquoIt seemed to be coming straight for us, and I got a terrible shock. It landed about  yards away, and before I heard the crash I saw a column of smoke and debris thrown high into the air from the house it struck.People who lived in Clydebank had been bracing themselves for an onslaught, aware that the presence of the John Brown  Co shipyard, as well as an armaments factory in the Singer Sewing Machine Works, and the Beardmore engine works, made it vulnerable.The Clydebank-born artist, Tom McKendrick, who has researched the Clydebank Blitz deeply, has noted that though many felt that the towns industrial profile marked it as prime target, some believed that the iron in the mountains surrounding Clydeside would interfere with the compasses of aircraft, thus making reliable target navigation impossible.By March , Clydebank, a town with a population of ,, had long grown accustomed to the piercing wail of alarms. There had been some   alarms in the preceding month alone. ldquoThe siren would go, perhaps because a single aircraft was flying overhead, one man recalled in a  BBC documentary on the Blitz, ldquoso in the event, when the sirens went on the thirteenth of March, a lot of people thought initially, itrsquos another  alarm.But it wasnt.ldquoAll the lights went out, and then we heard one or two crumps here and there, the first bombs starting to fall, remarked a second man. A third: ldquoThe next thing was an explosion hellip there was just a helter-skelter of debris. We knew this was no longer fun, we were a target.Helen Robertson, an air raid warden at the time, would recollect in : ldquoI remember incendiaries were falling just like flowers on a carpet, hundreds of them.Helenrsquos story is among many included in Untold Stories: Remembering Clydebank in Wartime, which was put together by the Clydebank Le Story Group. There are so many vivid, painful memories of loss and destruction in its pages. One more will suffice here, from Jean Golder, who was on ARP duty: ldquoI was on night sht and it was the most terrible experience of my le, the planes screaming, bombs exploding and the smell of burning .\"When we were allowed to make our way home, tears were streaming down our faces as we looked towards what had been terraced houses on the hill. There was nothing left but huge piles of rubble of what we called the lsquoHoly Cityrsquo.The staggering impact of the bombs and incendiaries on Clydebank has been well documented. Second Avenue had the highest number of deaths ndash  ndash when a parachute mine ripped the face off  yards of terraced housing, McKendrick writes. Entire families were wiped out as tenement buildings collapsed, crushing the occupants who had sought shelter in lower floors and closes.On the Friday morning, says John MacLeod in his vivid book, River of Fire, thousands of ldquodazed, filthy, bloodied survivors made their way along Dumbarton Road into Glasgow.That night, the Germans ed:  aircraft this time. Few people were left in Clydebank by this time, but many townsfolk would assert that this second raid was a more vindictive raid than the first, says MacLeod.A news report in Saturdays Glasgow Herald said that the ldquolong and fierce attack had been carried out ldquowith a grim and revolting sadism by relays of raiders hellip What angered Clydeside was not the fact that they were being raided. It was an attention they had expected. But they felt the insensate fury of the attack had not the manner or methods of an attempt to dislocate industry rather did they take it as a deliberate adventure in terrorism.By the Saturday night, ldquothe near-fabulous total of over , people had left the town . Homeless Bankies were sent to accommodation in towns across the central belt. ldquoThe town was all but destroyed. From one geographically small community,  people were dead  seriously injured. Hundreds ndash perhaps thousands ndash more were superficially hurt and cut. Of some , dwellings ndash including tenement blocks as well as villas and semi-detached homes ndash only seven were left entirely undamaged. Four thousand homes were completely destroyed , would be uninhabitable for months.Blitz victims were laid to rest without much ceremony in mass burials. The  Register of Deaths for Old or West Kirkpatrick registration district bears the names of over  of those who died in Clydebank. The cause of death is stated as lsquoDue to war operations.rsquoldquoWe were now seeing for the first time among our own people what had happened where, Mary Carson wrote. ldquoThese were the same as we had seen in pictures from Spain, from Finland, from Poland. ldquoFor all their national dferences their circumstances were now the same and they had that same look in the eyes ndash that stunned, numb look. And by the same cause ndash war.Many areas of Glasgow ndash Tradeston, Scotstoun, Partick, Hyndland, Kelvindale ndash also took direct hits over the two nights, and  people were killed. On the Sunday, in Hyndland, a boy of , whose name was Stanley Ewing, was found in the rubble that had once been his home. He was dressed in his pyjamas in a recessed bed his rescuers heard his voice long after they had assumed that no-one in the pile of debris could be alive.By a stroke of luck, a bag of sugar had been thrown into his bed from a cupboard when the house collapsed around him. The sugar was all he had to eat in the two days since. He was pulled from the wreckage, black with soot and dust but, in the words of one rescuer, ldquosurprisingly cheerful. ldquoIrsquom okay, he told them. ldquoWhen you get me out Irsquoll tell you where my mother and sister are. An -year-old girl was extricated from the wreckage.In Clydebank, in Glasgow, many other people were pulled from their devastated homes. One woman, trapped for six days, was brought out alive by a doctor and demolition workers, but died a few hours later in hospital.On March  two men, one of them a War Reserve policemen, were found, alive, in wreckage in Peel Street, Partick. John Cormack, , was found lying in a bed: a large wooden beam supported the weight of the debris above him. Only his face and arms were visible to his rescuers, who were understandably astonished when he gave them a feeble wave.Moving as quickly and as gently as possible, they shted the debris that had been trapping him. ldquoCould you go a cup of tea , asked Dr Ian A Mackay, who had been summoned to the scene. ldquoAye, ah could fine, Cormack replied. The fact that he had been beneath his blankets probably meant that he did not die from exposure.Later, he told reporters: ldquoI was in bed when I heard the bomb coming. I pulled the bedclothes over me. A crash followed, and the next thing I remember was finding myself buried with the bedclothes still wrapped around me. I had no idea how long I lay. The time passed fairly quickly, and occasionally I heard tappings and voices which seemed to be coming from a distance.It took three hoursrsquo painstaking work to free the other man, Fred Clarke, . A chest of drawers had apparently fallen over his body, too, protecting him from the mass of stone and timber above. Norman Manson, a joiner in charge of the rescue squad, said: ldquoWe had to smash in a floor and crawl underneath to locate the trapped constable. I estimate that we had to remove seven tons of wreckage before we were able to break a way through to him.Glasgowrsquos Lord Provost, Sir Patrick Dollan, launched a fund for the relief of Clydeside air-raid distress. Within three days it had raised pound, by March  the figure had climbed to pound,, including a donation of pound, by John Brownrsquos to a Central Fund.Still the bombing continued. An estimated  people were killed on the night of April  , when bombs fell everywhere: Largs, Greenock, Gretna, and such parts of Glasgow as Shawlands and Hyndland. A German bomber, ing home, dropped a stick of seven high-explosive bombs over part of Falkirk: a six-strong Home Guard patrol was blown of their feet by the blast and showered with mud.Eight people lost their lives in Greenock on April . ldquoBut the last and, in their own way, most terrible German raids on Clydeside began early on Tuesday  May, writes John MacLeod: Maryhill, Yoker, Kilmarnock, and many other places. Not even douce Cardross escaped, taking ldquoan assault of astonishing ferocity.The merciless bombing continued on the night of May  : Greenock suffered horribly, with around  people losing their lives. The two nightsrsquo bombing also claimed the lives of  people in Paisley and  in Port Glasgow.ldquoWhen the sirens went off around pm we went up to the shelter on Whinhill and the bombers came over. We had to come out of the shelter at one point. The distillery was bombed and whisky was running down Bakers Brae on fire! It was a sea of flames, recollected one Greenock woman, just  at the time, on the BBCrsquos WW Peoplersquos War page. A man who was working at Scottrsquos dry dock in the town that night remembered: ldquoThere were a destroyer and a submarine in the dry dock and the sub was knocked off its blocks.The Luftwaffe ed to London on May -, dropping  tons of high explosive and more than , incendiaries. Nearly , civilians died,On April , , it was, yet again, Aberdeenrsquos turn to suffer. ldquoIn the space of just  minutes,  bombs fell, damaging or destroying more than , homes and killing  civilians and  soldiers. Even though Aberdeen was the most frequently bombed city in Britain between  and  ndash a statistic that prompted the nickname Siren City ndash the scale and severity of that nightrsquos Luftwaffe raid shocked everyone. These words come from an article in the city newspaper, the Press and Journal, in September .Aberdeen, writes John MacLeod, was bombed  times during the war, though the figure of  is frequently quoted. Peterhead was bombed  times, Fraserburgh almost as many. Nowhere seemed safe.EIGHTdecades later, when you study photographs of the impact of the Blitz in Scotland, you find yourself looking at the same kind of images, again and again and again: facades of villas and tenements torn away, exposing interior walls, settees, bookcases and light-fittings rescue scenes illuminated by arc-lights families and young children with suitcases in devastated, once-familiar streets colossal piles of rubble. They bring home, just as powerfully as the first-hand testimonies and descriptions mentioned here, the stark horror of what befell Scotland eight decades ago.Some , people lost their lives in Scotland during the Blitz. Across the whole of the UK, the figure was in excess of ,.In March , the nineteenth anniversary of the attacks on Glasgow and Clydebank, John Cormack, the man who had lain trapped for eight days and nights in Peel Street, spoke to The Bulletin, our sister paper.

Once he had recovered, he joined the Navy.\"I dont know how youd put it\", he said, \"but you could say I had faith in coming out alive.\"I couldnt panic, because I couldnt move.

He once wrote a long novel without using the letter e. Imagin how hard that must hav bn. In October, , he spent a long weekend in ious cafeacutes in Saint-Sulpice, a district near Saint-Germain where I have stayed a few times. His book is a prosaic record of who and what passes by during his vigils: lsquoIt is five to six.

It was a Friday morning. Before breakfast, an oil tanker had called at neighbours, whose previous delivery had been wrongly apportioned between Aga tank and central heating, leaving them at risk of freezing. A teenage girl had set off for the school bus shortly thereafter, with a heavy bag on her shoulder.It was a quarter past ten when I settled with a notebook, the sun so bright I had to squint.

Once gathered, the lsquoCovid collectionrsquo will become permanently held within the national museum archives alongside other treasured artefacts from Scotlandrsquos history, to be used for exhibitions and displays far in the future.She said the museum is now in a race against time to gather pandemic-related items before they too are lost.ldquoAt the time of Ebola, we struggled to get signs at airports, they were not seen as material that was important or should be kept.ldquoOne thing that we might have already missed out on because of how fast things moved, were signs at supermarkets limiting the amount of toilet rolls that people could buy.ldquoItrsquos one thing that people remember, and we would have liked one of those.The collection is being split into six categories: public health, hospitals and treatment politics economy tourism education and everyday le.Among the first objects to be collected was a face shield made by a teacher at Lochaber High School using a D printer and finished with plastic  which was delivered to the local Belford hospital by Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team. The item is said to illustrate the impact of the pandemic on the NHS, PPE shortages, the community response and school closures.Other items include Hidden Disabilitiesrsquo sunflower lanyards and facemask exemption cards, and handknitted hearts which were distributed among Covid- patients and their loved ones at Glasgow intensive care units to help create a link between them at a time when hospital visiting was not allowed.One heart would be placed in the palm of an intensive care patient and the other given to a relative, to help forge an invisible and personal bond.The role of the army in helping with its installation and the cooperation with civilian agencies is also said to be of interest within the context of the museumrsquos military collections.At the other end of the spectrum, the curators are gathering symbols of happiness and hope that helped raise spirits during the darkest days ndash including a painted pebbled from a Shetland beach.She added: ldquoWe are being very selective, there is so much that we could collect - covid has shaped the world around us in many ways that we donrsquot think about.ldquoSuch as people who gave birth during the pandemic, who kept the masks they were wearing during that time to go alongside the babyrsquos mementos like name bracelets from hospital. Thatrsquos such a defining symbol of their experience, and these throwaway things have been kept.The collection will reflect Scotland as a whole, in the hope of showing future generations how dferent areas of the country responded to the crisis.ldquoWe want to show how lockdown has been experienced in dferent parts of the country, and how that experience ies because of culture and geological factors added Sarah.ldquoOne thing we would like have are the signs that appeared on the outside of villages in summer which rely heavily on the tourism industry, asking visitors to respect that the community was self-isolated and they were closed.ldquoWe saw that in relation to first lockdown as a way to quarantine in rural area. Signs were put up by iniduals, and there is a spectrum of dferent languages and dialects - some played with the Gaelic language.ldquoWe would love one of these signs they are still in use, but therersquos a waiting game with some of this material.The National Museum of Scotland is one of many around the world which has announced it is collecting coronavirus-related items to help explain the pandemic to people in years to come.Last week The Smithsonian National Museum of American History said it had acquired the vial that contained the first dose of Covid- vaccine administered in the United States as part of its plans to document the global pandemic and ldquothis extraordinary period we were going through.Meanwhile, Glasgow Museums, including the Riverside transport museum, has also said it is collecting pandemic items with a view to future exhibitions.Among the objects being gathered are examples of childrenrsquos lockdown schoolwork, posters relating to cancelled events and artworks which depict key workers.Sarah added: ldquoWe sometimes have a job telling people that we collect things from the present as well as the past - they think a museum is related to historic objects.ldquoBut everyone we have approached has realised these things have value, even when itrsquos not a terribly obvious object, people instantly understand why itrsquos of historic value."},{"url":null,"title":"big-read-final-resting-place-father-capitalism-adam-smith-resurrected-scottish-slavery-debate","story":"It doesnrsquot look controversial at first. But look a little bit closer. In places, the words are hard to read ndash theyrsquore a bit faded after a couple of hundred years of Edinburgh wind and rain ndash but you can just about make them out. ldquoHere are deposited the remains of the author of The Theory of Moral Sentiments and The Wealth of Nations. He was born th June  and died on th July .No more than that. No long tribute. No quotation from the Bible. No great lines from his books. Just his name: Adam Smith.He is, undoubtedly, the most famous person buried in this place, the graveyard of Canongate Kirk on the Royal Mile, just up from the Scottish Parliament.No-one really remembers Robert Keith, author of A History of the Church and State in Scotland from the Reformation to , or Professor Charles Alston, lecturer in botany at Edinburgh University, or Horatius Bonar, preacher and writer of hymns, or any of the others who are buried here.But everyone remembers Adam Smith.He is the most famous economist who ever lived.Fans and apostles of the great man, and historians and curious people interested in the Scottish Enlightenment, still visit the grave, but, unexpectedly, it has now become a source of controversy.Tomorrow, a body called the Edinburgh Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group will meet to look at a provisional list of monuments, places, and place names which could be investigated for their association with slavery and the empire. Adam Smithrsquos grave is on the list.The review group was formed last year by Edinburgh City Council in response to the Black Lives Matter protests with the aim of investigating sites in Edinburgh that might have links with slavery, including statues, monuments, and street names. The grouprsquos purpose, according to the council, was to recommend what needed to be done to ldquorecty the glorication of slavery and colonialism which the statues and other sites represent to many people.The group will report by the end of the year.lsquoNot prejudicialrsquoThe leader of the committee, Sir Geoff Palmer, professor emeritus in le sciences at Heriot-Watt University, has specically said he doesnrsquot want any statues to be taken down ndash ldquothe next statue down in our country should be racism, he has said ndash and that his preferred method is education and information.He would like Scottish people to understand their history better. He says: ldquoWersquore going to provide people with information about their city. That information will not be prejudicial, it is there to give the public information about the city and its links with slavery and colonialism.However, the inclusion of Smithrsquos grave on the list, which was leaked to The , has not gone down well. The historian Sir Tom Devine said he disagreed with a gravestone being treated in such a way. He also questioned the idea that Smith thought slavery was a fact of le, which was the apparent justication for including his grave on the list.Sir Tom said it was abundantly clear that Smith believed slavery was evil and inhumane.The question is: should we be surprised by any of this  Adam Smith, and his beliefs, have been misunderstood, or misappropriated, for quite a long time now.Thatcherrsquos praiseNOT only is it apparently being suggested that he was an apologist for slavery, he has often been described as the patron saint of capitalism or a cheerleader for the pursuit of self-interest, a kind of king of neoliberals. It also doesnrsquot particularly help his reputation with some modern audiences that one of his greatest fans was Margaret Thatcher.But Thatcher herself knew Smithrsquos philosophy was much subtler than the popular image. He did say self-interest was the underlying principle of economic le and famously wrote that ldquoit is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.But, as Thatcher pointed out, he also wrote about our instinct to help others. ldquoTo feel much for others and little for ourselves, he said, ldquoto restrain our selfish, and to indulge our benevolent affections, constitutes the perfection of human nature.What Smith was doing, really, was observing human nature and the fact that people are fundamentally self-interested, but it goes deeper than that.Russ Roberts, economist and author of How Adam Smith Can Change Your Le, believes Smith laid down some principles that can be applied to modern le and even help us to live better.He argues that Smithrsquos lesser-known book The Theory of Moral Sentiments ndash one of the titles inscribed on his gravestone ndash can be a kind of self-help book. In answer to the question ldquowhat did Adam Smith ever do for us , Robertsrsquos answer would be ldquomore than you think.Roberts sums it up this way: itrsquos kind of shocking, he says, to realise that the person we know as the father of economics didnrsquot think the pursuit of wealth was a very good idea, he thought it was corrosive, he thought it was bad for you, he thought ambition was bad for you, he thought the pursuit of fame would destroy your character and your happiness, your serenity and your tranquillity, and itrsquos all there in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments.The book, which was first published in , is largely forgotten and unread now ndash overshadowed by its more famous brother The Wealth of Nations ndash but Roberts believes that, in its mix of economics, philosophy, and psychology, there are real gems of truth about wealth, fame and ambition.One of Smithrsquos ideas, for instance, is the concept of the ldquoimpartial spectator, a kind of inner voice that can tell us whatrsquos right and wrong, and guide our behaviour imagine, he says, that you are being judged not by God but by another human being.Roberts believes this concept of the impartial spectator can be useful in modern le. Speaking to Reason magazine, he said the idea is an interesting way to think about your behaviour: ldquoTo step outside yourself and say, lsquoin this setting, is my outrage really justied when Irsquom working myself into a state over some inconvenience or some lsquoinjusticersquo  would an outsider whorsquos not me think that rsquo I think thatrsquos a useful way to step outside yourself and see whatrsquos going on.Roberts believes there are other values in Smithrsquos philosophy that have relevance today, particularly his ldquobig three, the values that he says should guide us all: justice, beneficence, and prudence. Justice means not hurting others, beneficence means being good to others, and prudence means being good to yourself.A principled manTHE prudent man, says Smith, is sincere and honest, hersquos cautious in his speech and doesnrsquot stick his opinion into every discussion hersquos a good friend and his friendships are a ldquofaithful attachment to a few well-tried and well-chosen companions. In the world of social media, thatrsquos not a bad set of principles to stick to.And Roberts says it isnrsquot the only example of Smithrsquos apparent prescience ndash in fact, Roberts believes that, in some ways, the great economist predicted our obsession with the internet, gadgets, and mobile phones.ldquoAdam Smith says, basically, that we fall in love with little conveniences, says Roberts. ldquoHe calls them lsquofrivolous trinkets of utilityrsquo which is really what our gadgets are all about. In particular, of all things, he picks on the watch hellip he makes fun of the fact, and really judges the person who pays a premium for a watch thatrsquos a little more accurate, just because itrsquos kind of amazing and wonderful. But it doesnrsquot make the person any more punctual.ldquoTheyrsquore not more accurate, they just know how inaccurate they are. So, he makes fun of the fact that we love these gadgets.Some might say therersquos a paradox at work in all of this. How can the man famous for writing a book about self-interest and how it makes the world go round also write a book that says that self-interest and self-obsession isnrsquot the only thing that matters But Roberts says Smithrsquos two most famous books are really about very dferent things: The Theory of Moral Sentiments is a book about our personal space and the people we see frequently whereas The Wealth of Nations is about how we behave in the marketplace, a place of impersonal exchange, of strangers.But in both books, Smith is concerned about how we behave rather than how hersquod like us to behave.It is in this context that we should see his views on slavery. In response to the controversy over Smithrsquos grave, Tom Devine drew attention to the lectures the great man delivered on justice, police, revenue and arms in , long before the formal establishment of the abolitionist movement in Britain.In the lectures, Smith describes the treatment of slaves in ancient Rome. At night, he said, ldquonothing was to be heard but the cries of slaves whom their masters were punishing.He also talked about the brutal day-to-day le that slaves must have led, ldquotheir le and their property entirely at the mercy of another, and their liberty,they could be said to have any, at his disposal too.lsquoColonialrsquo sitesWHAT seems to be more problematic ndash and itrsquos this that seems to have led to Smithrsquos grave appearing on the list of ldquocolonial sites in Edinburgh ndash was his pessimism about the chances of abolition.ldquoSlavery, he said, ldquotakes place in all societies at their beginning, and proceeds from that tyrannic disposition which may almost be said to be natural to mankind. It is indeed almost impossible that it should ever be totally or generally abolished.Now, you may think that Smithrsquos views are abhorrent and suggest we must accept slavery as inevitable, or you may think that the existence of modern slavery in the st century proves him right. But the truth is that, as well as being credited with influencing modern economic thinking, Smith is also credited with influencing the anti-slavery movement.William Wilberforce, who met Smith in , quoted him often, and Smithrsquos arguments were included in early anti-slavery material. Strange, then, that a council body looking for sites associated with slavery should zoom in on Adam Smithrsquos grave. Whether the site will make the final list is unclear.Perhaps the review group will listen to the criticism ndash in any case, the decision will be taken tomorrow. But Geoff Palmer, the man who leads the group, knows the subtleties involved. If you start removing things from their context, he says ndash statues, for example ndash in  years we will have forgotten the context.And itrsquos important that we know that context, and the nuances and complexities, because the nuances and complexities cannot always be seen in the words on a gravestone, faded by  years of Edinburgh wind and rain."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-world-darkness-descending-upon-myanmar","story":"For many Burmese it has brought new meaning to the term ldquonight terrors. Online the hashtag #nightdragging is used by many residents among Myanmarrsquos towns and cities to help band together and co-ordinate warnings and resistance to the night-time raids by security forces looking for daytime protesters.It has now been six weeks since the armed forces under General Min Aung Hlaing ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, detained her and officials of her National League for Democracyparty, and set up a ruling junta.In the intervening period since the putsch, the country has been plunged into a kind of Orwellian nightmare thatrsquos become real, where disappearances have become the order of the day. The hours of darkness are an especially terrying time for many hunkering down in this long troubled Asian country of  million people.In a message replete with the sort of doublespeak that could have come straight from the pages of George Orwellrsquos dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, the State Administration Council ndash a title chosen by the coup-makers ndash announced that it was taking away basic civil liberties, allowing for indefinite detention and for the police to search homes with impunity. And in the same vein, the Military Information Unit issued a statement that made a rather duplicitous attempt at explaining the security forces presence across Myanmar.ldquoSecurity forces will be performing day and night security for the public to sleep peacefully in the community, the statement said, evenmost ordinary citizens interpreted this for what it really meant.Despite a crackdown on the internet and online provision by the junta, video and other reports still come out of the country and tell a very dferent story. From two of Myanmarrsquos biggest cities, Yangon and Mandalay, there have been reports of unidentied men at night setting fires to frighten and perhaps provoke residents onto the streets.Videos posted online almost nightly show heavily-armed security forces prowling the streets shooting bullets and tear gas at homes and around residential areas while terried citizens cower at their windows.They also show truckloads of soldiers arriving at households from which suspected protesters and other activists can be seen being beaten and bundled into trucks before their own cars are sometimes also taken away by the army.Threat of arrestIN response, civilians in local neighbourhoods do what they can to resist or warn those in peril of arrest. Some bang pots and pans as early warning signs as the troops fan out in their neighbourhoods while others swarm the streets to try and prevent the arrests.ldquoOur nights arenrsquot safe anymore and ldquoMyanmar military is kidnapping people at night are common captions on messages shared widely online.ldquoThis is an army with a heart of darkness, David Scott Mathieson, an independent analyst who has long studied the practices of the Myanmar military was cited by numerous news outlets as saying a few days ago. ldquoThis is an unrepentant institution, Mathieson added, speaking of the Tatmadaw, as the army is known and which first came to power in a  coup, saying that it had to safeguard national unity.Human rights observers say that with the generals now back running the country the army is using lethal tactics and an arsenal of battlefield weapons to carry out a ldquokilling spree against peaceful protesters who oppose this yearrsquos February  coup.Amid the deteriorating situation, a leading UN expert said the military has likely committed ldquocrimes against humanity in its attempt to stay in power.While stressing that such offences can only be determined in a court of law, Thomas Andrews, the UNrsquos special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, said the crimes likely included ldquoacts of murder, enforced disappearance, persecution, torture carried out with ldquothe knowledge of senior leadership, including junta leader General Hlaing.For some Myanmar watchers, though, such behaviour by the army comes as little surprise. Military analysts point to the fact that the Tatmadawrsquos lower ranks have for a long time now been at the sharp end of ethnic wars in the country.During the last three years, the Tatmadaw has waged war intermittently against ethnic rebel armies in three states: Rakhine, Shan, and Kachin.AtrocitiesBATTLEFIELD atrocities include the rape of women and girls, and the use of civilians as human shields have brutalised the same infantrymen that are now patrolling Myanmarrsquos streets.Witnesses in Mandalay recently reported seeing soldiers from the rd Light Infantry Division, which led the deadly campaign against Rohingya Muslims in western Rakhine state in .Rights groups have voiced alarm at the juntarsquos deployment of a unit blamed for atrocities against civilians, including a massacre of  Rohingya men. The US Treasury imposed sanctions against Aung Hlaing, the isionrsquos commander, in .ldquoThese Myanmar military tactics are far from new, but their killing sprees have never before been live-streamed for the world to see, said Joanne Mariner, the director of crisis response at Amnesty International, speaking about the latest crackdown.She was speaking after Amnestyrsquos Crisis Evidence Lab veried the more than  videos of the ongoing crackdown and confirmed that security forces ldquoappear to be implementing planned, systematic strategies including the ramped-up use of lethal force.ldquoMany of the killings documented amount to extrajudicial executions, the rights group said.Meanwhile, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners , a long-established group that helps political detainees in Myanmar, has warned thatthe military coup is not reversed, then the arbitrary arrests will only increase.ldquoFamily members are left with no knowledge of the charges, location, or condition of their loved ones. These are not isolated incidents, and night-time raids are targeting dissenting voices. It is happening across the country, the AAPP said in a statement.In cracking down so violently, the Tatmadaw has once again cast Myanmar as a pariah state and turning the clock back to the isolationist era that preceded the past decadersquos slow opening in the country.Not surprisingly, there has been deepening international condemnation these past weeks against the coup and military rule, but General Hlaing and his cadres have shown no signs of backing down. Why would they, some ask, when their seizure of power has as much to do with protecting the militaryrsquos sprawling, and highly lucrative, business interests For decades, the generals have amassed fortunes by controlling the state bureaucracy and establishingnear-monopolies in key sectors.Through two highly shadowy military-controlled giants, Myanmar Economic Holdings Limitedand the Myanmar Economic Corporation , it is estimated that at least  companies in the country are wholly or partially overseen by generals, according to a report by Justice For Myanmar , a covert group of activists who campaign for justice and accountability.Such conglomerates control businesses and investments in sectors ranging from beer, tobacco and consumables to mines, mills, tourism, property development and telecommunications.Much of the lucrative ndash and largely unregulated ndash jade and ruby trade is controlled by military-owned businesses.Jewel controlSINCE , the disaster-prone jade industry has remained ldquocontrolled by a network of military elites, drug lords and their cronies, according to NGO Global Witness that tracks corruption and exploitation.Although Myanmar is the worldrsquos largest producer of jade, and the trade is estimated to be worth billions of dollars a year, only a very small part of the financial windfall ends up in state coffers with most high-quality stones believed to be smuggled over the border into China.Indeed, Chinarsquos closeness with the Myanmar couprsquos generals and its reluctance to condemn their takeover stems, say analysts, from Beijingrsquos substantial vested economic interests in Myanmar.Ruling for nearly half a century, ldquothe military top brass had time to enrich themselves, said Francoise Nicolas, Asia director of the French Institute of International Relations. The brief stint of quasi-civilian rule from   did little to change that. But the military may have feared for its future prospects after Suu Kyirsquos party won by a landslide in November, Nicolas told Agence France Presserecently.ldquoThis risked endangering part of their wealth and was very probably part of their decision to launch a putsch, she added.The junta, however, appears determined that the world interprets the situation very dferently. So determined, in fact, that it has hired an Israeli-Canadian lobbyist who will be paid  million to ldquoassist in explaining the real situation of the armyrsquos coup to the US and other countries, according to documents filed with the US government.Ari Ben-Menashe and his firm, Dickens  Madson Canada, will represent Myanmarrsquos military government in Washington, and lobby Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Russia, as well as international bodies like the United Nations, according to a consultancy agreement, Reuters news agency reported.Ben-Menashersquos client portfolio ndash which has included late Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe ndash has drawn attention before. But by working with Myanmarrsquos military, legal experts say he risks violating US sanctions imposed on top generals.ResettlementBEN-MENASHE told Reuters his task was to convince Washington that Myanmarrsquos generals wanted to move closer to the West and away from China. He said they wanted to resettle Rohingya Muslims who fled a  assault for which the UN has accused the military of overseeing a genocide. Few human rights observers, however, believe Ben-Menashe has any chance of persuading the Americans.ldquoIt is highly implausible that he could convince the United States of the narrative hersquos proposing, said John Ston, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.Meanwhile, as all these geopolitical machinations continue, so too do the dark deeds being enacted on the street of Myanmarrsquos town and cities.Alongside the armyrsquos paranoid and uncompromising worldview, it has only intensied its repressive campaign against its own citizens. In turn, protesters have adopted myriad strategies in their efforts to counter the security forces on the streets.Many women have been at the forefront of the protests and adopted some unusual tactics. Several news reports have told how some taking advantage of the misogyny and superstition of the security forces have hung up the traditional sarongs they wear in Myanmar, and their underwear and bras, on clothes lines around protest zones.Soldiers and police are said to be hesitant to walk under them because of superstitious beliefs that these womenrsquos garments can sap them of their masculinity and bring them bad luck.ldquoThe younger generation nowadays doesnrsquot believe it anymore, but the soldiers still do, and itrsquos theirweakness. So, we might gain moretime to runthey come towards us in case of emergency, said one -year-old protester who declined to givetheir name to reporters for fear of reprisals.Already the junta has responded by outlawing the practice, and security forces have been photographed removing the clothes lines and even burning the sarongs.Digging inSIX weeks after the coup both sides appear to be digging their heels in. In Myanmarrsquos largest city, Yangon, eyewitnesses describe the protests as resembling siege warfare.Many of the predominately young people, mostly in their s and s, who have taken to the streets, wear helmets and gas masks and carry shields.,In a deadly game of cat and mouse, they stand their ground, one moment slowing down the security forcesbefore fleeing then reassembling the moment the police and army leave.But Myanmarrsquos army is well equipped, battle-hardened and brutal ndash and the only side that carries theguns.This weekend, worried at the escalating violence, the UK Government has urged its citizens to flee Myanmar warning that ldquopolitical tension and unrest are widespread since the military takeover and levels of violence are rising.Tensions have heightened, too, after the civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been detained since day one of the coup, was accused by the military of taking bribes worth . million in cash and gold.ldquoMyanmarrsquos military seems sadistically intent on breaking the nationrsquos spirit, read an editorial written by staff at the English and Burmese language news site, Myanmar Now, which was raided by soldiers last week in a crackdown on independent media.Retreat for either side, it would seem, is not really an option and only time will tell whether the ldquonationrsquos spirit can indeed be broken by the military.Meanwhile, the dark deeds being carried out by the army are unlikely to stop anytime soon."},{"url":null,"title":"alister-jack-uks-covid-19-vaccine-programme-envy-world","story":"The Scottish

Indeed, since the COVID- pandemic began, OIC has presided over such major decisions as how to distribute £.million in Islands Deal government funding, the approval of a £million harbours masterplan, and extending £million worth of funding to Orkney’s Island Games.All of these matters were discussed virtually, via Microsoft Teams video conferencing software.Full story in Thursday#s The Orcadian, available now online and in shops.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This ensures that local authorities are fully funded to operate their internal ferry services.“This delivers a key ask from the Scottish Government#s local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Of course for Orkney it facilitates the introduction of Sunday services and Road Equivalent Tarfon inter-island ferries.“The Scottish Government has stated that it is well aware of the growing need for local authorities to replace ageing ferry fleets and infrastructure. While responsibility for funding replacement infrastructure remains with the councils, Scottish Ministers are committed to continuing engagement.“The passing of the budget also means £. million is coming Orkney Islands Council’s way, up £. million on last year — a . per cent hike.”Both Mr Leslie and Orkney#s MSP, Liam McArthur, welcomed increased spending in areas such as mental health services, education, green initiatives, business support and agri-environment.Mr Leslie added: “I am sure folk across Orkney will join me in welcoming this budget, there is plenty in it for islanders to be pleased about as we look to build a better, fairer and greener future for us all.”Meanwhile, Mr McArthur welcomed a number of concessions included in the budget, notably the additional funding for Orkney#s internal ferry services.But he says this now needs to be a long-term commitment from the Scottish Government and backed by support for new vessels.Commenting on the budget, Mr McArthur said: “Over the last year, along with my Scottish Liberal Democrat colleagues, I have sought to hold the government to account over its handling of this crisis. I have done so, however, constructively and with the interests of supporting constituents and our community at the forefront.“That approach has remained the same during this year’s budget negotiations and I’m pleased that we’ve secured funding for a number of areas that will be important for our country’s recovery. A signicant increase in investment for mental health services, for example, delivers on a key ask from the Scottish Liberal Democrats as we look to address our country’s mental health crisis.“The additional funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services is also very welcome after years of broken promises and Orkney being short changed.  It’s vital, though, that this is not just a one-off pre-election gesture but part of a long term commitment by government that also includes addressing the urgent need for new vessels.“Meantime, I’m glad that cross-party agreement could be reached on this budget at a time when politicians from all parties should be absolutely focused on putting the recovery first.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Carmichael said: “The DVSA appears to be taking a Central Belt approach to all corners of Scotland, whether or not that approach makes sense here — either that or they believe that all islanders get around by boat!“Driving is a necessity for many in the isles and we cannot afford to wait around for this backlog to be cleared — the DVSA needs to take specic measures to ensure that the isles are not left behind.”The joint letter sent to the DVSA head at one part states: “With relevant precautions and testing, some tests could take place in Orkney and Shetland, which would allow any backlog in the Northern Isles to be cleared.“We are therefore asking you to ensure that driving test examiners are posted to Orkney and Shetland whilst the Islands remain in Level Three to carry out the lawful execution of essential services.”Full story in this week#s The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I think it was painful and pretty triggering to see, she told the PA news agency the morning after. vw,vw,px, px\"Jamie Klingler ldquoThe fact that nobody stepped in and said: lsquoDo you see how this looks rsquo The fact that Thursday and Friday they wasted our organising time by dragging us to the High Court for our human rights to protest and we were going to have a silent vigil.ldquoEspecially today, itrsquos Motherrsquos Day. Itrsquos the week of International Womenrsquos Day. And instead of allowing and facilitating it like the Lambeth police wanted to ndash and that police force was so supportive ndash Scotland Yard quashed us and in doing so silenced us and got the reaction they got last night.The campaigner also criticised the Metrsquos defence of its actions, after Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said officers were put in a position ldquowhere enforcement action was necessary.Ms Klingler said the event would have been carried out safely had the original Reclaim The Streets vigil been allowed to go ahead, adding that the only reason people had crowded close together was because they could not hear the speakers.ldquoWe had a PA system, we had one steward for every  people that was going to attend, wersquove had all of those things in place, so that there would not have been any crowding, so that there would not have been any issues.Having cancelled the event and others around the country, Reclaim These Streets instead urged people to honour Ms Everardrsquos memory at home through candlelit vigils which were observed by politicians, celebrities and the public alike. vw,vw,px, px\"A candle lit by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds is placed on the doorstep of  Downing Street The group also set up an online fundraising campaign with a target matching the pound, fines they said they would have faced had the planned events gone ahead.That target was reached within hours, and Ms Klingler said she was ldquoblown away as the total approached pound, around a day after it was launched.ldquoThis is the start of the movement, she said, adding that the group was still working out where best to distribute the money.ldquoI donrsquot know how exactly to explain what it feels like to be at the centre of a tidal wave.ldquoBut it feels like a tidal wave of half of the population saying: lsquoThis is your problem, you need to fix it and you need to fix it now ndash wersquore not taking it any morersquo.Ms Klingler added: ldquoItrsquos a poignant day. I lost my mum a couple of years ago. Itrsquos a hard day, but I know she would be really proud that Irsquom standing up to be heard for the women that donrsquot have the opportunity to stand up and be heard, and that Irsquom fighting against violence against women by men.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The red glow of tail lights shepherds motorists down Coleraine Road to the traffic lights, the sound of their engines reverberating off the closed shutters of Walshs Hotel. A khaki-clad mannequin stares ominously from the window of Crawford Field Sports, a silent sentry keeping watch on the crossroads. Through the filter of early Spring, youd be forgiven for thinking normality had ed. The sight of a woman rushing across the road, face visor steaming up with the effort, shatters the mirage. googletag.cmd.push Frustrated faces peer from stationary vehicles on Main Street. Childrens voices carry down Station Road, in contrast to the eerie quiet of the Lurach Centre play park. Crows cackle in the trees above the Walled Garden and the smell of freshly slurried fields attacks the senses on the way through. The Largantogher Walkway cuts through the town. Through the dense trees lies the disputed Maghera High School site, ground zero in a long-running battle between the council and a local environmental group over its new purpose. Planning permission for an industrial park has been granted, but Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is set to have the final say. googletag.cmd.push Asto underline the point, a council van sits outside the gate. Keep Out notices are festooned along theof the fence. On the corner, two metal slats have been prised off for access. On the way back up the Tobermore Road, two children come down on their bikes, their mum running alongside them. A treat on the final day of homeschooling, perhaps. Back on Main Street, tattered Slaughtneil flags hang outside the Dugout Bar, clinging on in defiance as it continues to wait for a reopening commitment. Two men in caps are chatting outside Kellys Eurospar. A woman opens the door of the pharmacy across the road and calls out. She wants to knowhes going in for the paper.     “Ive no money on me,” comes the reply. The chapel and Fairhill Youth Centre are deserted, but at Crawfordsburn four children move in tandem on the swings. Two teenage girls walk down Glenview, eating from a bag of chips. Its a case of small mercies for the young amid the pandemic. An empty playground at Crawfordsburn. Children have been hit hard by the pandemic. A mounted sign at the entrance to Crawfordsburn Drive urges Solidarity with Palestine. Across the road, a more understated sign from Watty Grahams GAC urges people to take home their rubbish. On the way back in the road, the play park is once again deserted. Neither young nor old are hanging around too long these days. At the corner of Fairhill, McKennas Bar is operating their off licence, and doing a brisk Friday afternoon trade. A table cordoning off the entrance and a screen that drops down from the ceiling bring a sobering reality to the scene. Caitliacuten McKenna is actually reading the Derry Post as I arrive and says it might be the first time shes given us her real name. Shes referring to the Out and About pictures, smiling revellers appeasing the photographer for a two-page spread that is sadly no longer a possibility. For now. Caitliacuten, Caoimhe, and owner Sean McKenna, are all pining for those better days. “Last summer was good craic out in the beer garden,” says Caitliacuten. “Wed always had that space but we revamped it a good bit to make more use of it. Even people who knew it was there were surprised at how big it was when it was overhauled. “Its not too hard to get your , steps a day carrying pints out there.” “Its been a big change, serving people through the hatch and not letting anybody in. Youd have been used to people around the bar a lot of the time,” adds Sean. Sean, Caoimhe and Caitliacuten McKenna hard at work in McKennas Bar. “This is a social hub, youd have had people in and out all the time, whereas out there, though they may be some of the same people from the bar, theyre only staying for a minute and away they go again. “Another change is Im sitting at home on a Friday or Saturday night from  oclock thinking I should be doing something.” The flow of customers interrupts our chat. People finishing up work for the weekend, some calling in on a whim, others a more regular sight. Caoimhe tells me it has been hard on those regulars for whom the pub is very much an arena for conversation. “You do get some who will stand and have a wee chat, because its maybe their only social interaction,” she says. “Its been a while since theyve seen some people, so you get a wee bit of gossip out there that you miss out on having the bar closed. “Then when it gets to  oclock, its mad out there, just before closing. Everybody ends up having a chat with each other at the hatch. “Theyre more likely to meet someone they know then. You also get a lot of people waving in while they are out for their exercise as well.”  We mention the general dferences between the current period of restrictions and the previous lockdowns, but its interesting to view them through the lens of the pub owners. “People arent buying as much drink as they were the first time round,” says Caoimhe. “The weather isnt the same and people cant sit outside in their gardens at the minute. It was a novelty, and people were almost treating it like a holiday. “The town is busier than last time round. It was really, really quiet before, but there is definitely more traffic and more people about than the previous lockdown. “We have noticed a wee bit of a change with a lot more people buying craft beer that they might have had access tothey were out in bars further afield – Belfast or Derry maybe. “A lot of people were making cocktails the first time down. People were asking for all sorts of things at the start that wed never had before because they were making cocktails.” On the way out, Sean draws my attention to the crystal Kalashnikov hanging above the off licence tills. From Russia with love. Covid-, a less welcome import from the East, has brought down a muffled filter on the streets of our towns and villages. Conversation is terse, interaction limited. Hope might spring eternal but you cant gulp on it forever. Magheras Covid rate fell into double figures last week, and despite a slight increase this week, expectant eyes turn towards the decisions of the NI Executive. Heading home on the Coleraine Road, the site of the old police station is busy with construction, the new leisure facilities moving closer to completion. Maghera is poised and ready when normality gets the green light.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The British government decide to suppress the meeting and make sure future crowds dont get the same ideas.

Clouds Of Sils Maria:Sunday, BBC @ am An actress revisits the play that made her career  years ago. But this time shes taking an older role and it forces her to re-evaluate things.

Red River: Sunday: ITV @ .pm Tom Dunston has  cattle to bring to market and  miles of open terrain to move them across.

This is one of the most satisfying horror comedys of the s. Its a little bit dated but its still hilariously creepy, gory, gooey  thrilling.

For little Rosie its a source of wonder and amazement. For other, more elderly folk, its unwanted modernity barging its way into their lives.

Misery:St Patricks Day, Film @ pm Paul Sheldon is driving home from a writing trip when he crashes in the Rocky mountains and nearly dies. A woman living nearby saves him. A woman named Annie Wilkes. She claims to be his biggest fan. Rob Reiners  adaption of the Stephen King novel is heady stuff, hilarious, unsettling, brutal and unrelentingly tense.

Blue Is The Warmest Colour: Thursday, Channel  @ .am In Lille in northern France a girl called Adegravele meets woman called Emma. They fall in love. We witness the relationship from beginning to end. This film is famous for some pretty explicit love scenes but there is far more to it than that.

The Mountain Between Us: Friday   RTEacute One @ .pm A man and a woman in a rush hire a private plane that crashes smack bang in the middle of the Rocky mountains when the pilot has an ill timed stroke. No one knows where they are and they havent a clue what to do. This is as melodramatic as movies get but theres a lot of fun to be had watching Kate Winslet and Idris Elba battling against everything mother nature can throw at them. Plus the scenery is absolutely magnicent. Maps To The Stars: Friday, BBC @ .pm A trip into the slimy and sleazy underbelly of the rich and famous of Hollywood courtesy of David Cronenberg. The stories of a young tourist, a limo driver, a psychiatrist and two actors, one on the way up and one on the way down become intertwined.

Blade Of The Immortal: Friday, Film @ .pm Manji is a wandering samurai in medieval Japan who cannot be killed. Hes tasked with protecting an orphan and with taking revenge on the men who made her so. Just because he cant die doesnt mean his task is easy. If you havent seen a Takashi Miike film before you might be appalled at the carnage here butyou have youll have a wicked time.

The Job Retention Scheme was introduced last March to support businesses and organisations who had to temporarily lay off staff due to the pandemic. The government said it would pay up % of the salary of employees placed on furlough. At one stage, the local council had placed  employees on furlough. The council had agreed to pay the remaining % of the furloughed workers salaries during the lay-off period to ensure they received their full pay. Almost half of the council employees have ed to work but  remain on furlough. Details on the money saved by the council as a result of the furlough scheme were outlined on Tuesday at a meeting of the councils Governance and Strategic Committee. googletag.cmd.push A report shared with councillors at the meeting revealed that from March last year to January this year, the council had recouped a total of pound,, from the furlough scheme. The furlough scheme had been due to end on April  next. However, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, this week announced that the scheme would be extended to the end of September this year. The Job Retention Scheme has protected more than  million jobs since its inception last year and has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as businesses remain shut. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two years ago, Derry City and Strabane District Council commissioned Playboard NI to carry out a detailed audit of all the play facilities available in the local area. The findings of the audit were outlined yesterday at a meeting of the councils Environment and Regeneration Committee. The report found that more than a third of the  parks in council area were of a poor standard. This included the Currynierin park. Speaking at the meeting, Sinn Fein councillor Christopher Jackson said the details of the audit report highlighted the scale of the task that is in front of us all in relation to improving local play facilities. googletag.cmd.push He said he had a number of concerns, particularly in relation to areas of the Waterside. Cllr Jackson said many of the issues had been red-flagged for a considerableof time. He said a consultation had been carried out with the community in Currynierin and a new play facility had been designed for the area and taken through the planning process. He said the project has been spade-ready for a number of years but work has not started. “As a council we have built up expectation in the local community but we delivered absolutely nothing,” he said. “It is not good enough that we bring play facilities or schemes up to the stage where it is spade-ready and then it sits on a shelf.” googletag.cmd.push Cllr Jackson asked for a report to be prepared by council officers specically on the Currynierin park plans to show what funding opportunities have been explored and what barriers have been put in place in relation to the delay with the project. Cllr Jacksons comments were supported by Alliance councillor Philip McKinney who described the current play facilities in Currynierin as an absolute disgrace. Cllr McKinney said thatchildren from the area wanted to use good playing facilities they have to cross two busy roads to access a play park in Drumahoe. In response, Colin Kennedy, the councils Parks Development Manager, said that a funding application for the Currynierin park had been submitted to the Department of Justice but it had been unsuccessful.     He said a further application had been made to the Department of Communities for the necessary funding but added that bid had been left undetermined. Mr Kennedy said they would bring back a comprehensive report on what has been done to date in relation to the proposed Currynierin park and what the next stages are. He added that there was a huge amount of work to be done on how the council is going to find the funding to deliver on all the proposed play schemes in the local area. DUP Alderman David Ramsey described the park at Rossdowney Drive in the Waterside as dangerous and said that what equipment remained needed to be removed and replaced. It was agreed at the meeting that a detailed plan should be put together on the costs involved in upgrading the play facilities and brought before councillors later this year for approval.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The call comes from Lilian Seenoi-Barr, from the North-West Migrants Forum, who was speaking after figures showed the Derry and Strabane district recorded the biggest increase in racist incidents in the North last year, as well as the second-largest increase in racist crimes. Speaking to the Derry News, Mrs Seenoi-Barr said: “Racism and hate crime instil fear into entire communities and undermine social cohesion. “We cannot allow such fundamental rights violations to persist at their current high levels. googletag.cmd.push “We need to have serious conversations about race and racism in Derry before it gets out of hand. “It is now time for Derry City and Strabane District Council to develop a local action plan to tackle racial inequalities and racism in Derry. “We also need political and religious leaders in the city to take a proactive approach to tackle racism and prejudice towards people of minority ethnic backgrounds. They cannot simply be bystanders. “Political will and leadership are vital to countering racism and hate crime. The opportunities enjoyed by both political and religious leaders to shape opinions and set agendas come with a responsibility to unequivocally denounce expressions of racism and related intolerance.” googletag.cmd.push Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Karen Mullan has said the new figures were very concerning. “There is no place for racism in our community. “It’s imperative on us all to work together as a society to stamp out racism and a build a more equal society free from discrimination. “All incidents of racism should be reported to and dealt with by the police.” On Monday, Mrs Seenoi-Barr was among a number of anti-racism groups who met with local councillors to discuss racism, sectarianism and anti-semitism. During the meeting, she told councillors that the Derry City and Strabane area had seen the largest increase in racist incidents between January  and December , adding that in her view it was fair to say we are going backwards in relation to racist incidents in the city.     Foyle SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin described the reported rise in racists in- cidents in Derry and Stra- bane as deeply disturbing.  She said: “In Derry we are proud to call ourselves a welcoming city but these statistics expose how that welcome does not always extend to all. “It is also incredibly worrying that so few victims actually receive justice. Of the  racist hate crimes recorded in Derry and Strabane policing area last year, outcomes such as charges or cautions were recorded in just four cases from April to December. “I suspect that these statistics only just scratch the surface. The PSNI must work to build trust with black and minority ethnic communities and ensure victims are adequately supported. That must be an urgent priority. “Every single one of us has a role to play in actively challenging racism, in all its forms, within our communities. These conversations arent always going to be easy or comfortable, but they are absolutely vitalwe are to stamp out racism and build a society in which everyone feels safe and respected.” Meanwhile, a UUP councillor on the local authority has apologised after making insensitive comments in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement during Mondays meeting. Alderman Derek Hussey said the Black Lives Matter movement was not fully inclusive, and added that this weeks meeting was addressing issues which go beyond Black Lives Matter However, in a statement issued by his party the following day, he said: “I apologise for my comments which were insensitive. “I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from those who presented and to expand my own understanding of racism in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist Party opposes all forms of racism and we want to see hate crime legislation strengthened in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme, which starts near the junction with the Edenreagh Road and continue eastwards for a distance of  metres, will, according to the Department of Transport, greatly improve the strength and surface quality of the road. To facilitate preliminary works it will be necessary to implement a lane closure from am to pm daily, from Monday, March , to Saturday, March . A full road closure will be required to enable surfacing works, details of which will be advised at a later date. googletag.cmd.push A Department of Transport spokesperson said they have carefully planned these roadworks and associated traffic management arrangements in order to minimise inconvenience to the public during the period of the roadworks. Road users are advised to avoid the area whenever possible and to allow extra time for their journey and to follow the alternative routes which will be clearly signed on the approaches to the closure. Completion of the work is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. All work will be carried out in line with current public health and health and safety advice, with safe systems of working in place for staff and contractors. googletag.cmd.push In the interests of public safety and the safety of the contractor’s workforce the public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Asked when they would like toto watching live football, .% said they would seek to“as soon as possible”, ahead of “when there are no restrictions on gate numbers”and “when Covid is no longer an issue at all” . On the eve of the new League of Ireland season, a total of , football supporters responded to a survey led by the Irish Supporters Network , and supported by their colleagues in the Irish Football Supporters Partnership , the Confederation of Republic of Ireland Supporters Clubsand YBIG Independent Supporters Mandate. googletag.cmd.push The IFSP has had two representatives on FAI Council since July  and works to ensure that all fans have a voice within the association’s structures. Of the supporters that managed to attend a League of Ireland fixture in the second half of , there was strong praise for the efforts of clubs as well as their staff and volunteers in making fixtures safe, well organised and also welcoming those that could attend. % of respondents identied with a League of Ireland club from across the Premier and First Divisions. Reopening football Askedthey were willing to adhere to public health guidance and stadium protocols in order to facilitate a limitedwhen it is safe to do so, a huge majorityof respondents answered ‘Yes’. googletag.cmd.push In addition, .% of respondents pledged to publicly support an awareness campaign aimed at promoting public health guidance amongst the wider football communityit helped to re-open keep football open to supporters in the coming months. Irish football’s financial dependency on supporters was highlighted once again when respondents were asked why they wanted toto stadia as soon as possible. The most popular ‘Priority ’ was financial support for clubs and teams. The social and community element of football also shone through too, with the second and third most popular choices being: Football is my main pastime and It’s a social outlet for me.     On measures that would encourage supporters toto grounds once it’s safe to do so, masks were seen as an important consideration: -A requirement to wear a mask around the ground Phased exit -Being able to attend with the people I normally go with -Assigned seating  Just over a quarter of respondents had the opportunity to attend a League of Ireland fixture after grounds opened up again with limited capacity last summer. The vast majority that had this opportunity felt the guidance and instructions provided were ‘Very clear’ and, when asked to share additional feedback, comments strongly commended clubs for their work in ensuring games were safe and followed protocols. In a further demonstration of supporters’ loyalty, .% of respondents are still willing to purchase season tickets despite the uncertainty around timelines for supporters ing.

The vast majority of supporters want toas soon as they possibly can and are hugely supportive of any public health guidance and the stadia protocols that will allow that to happen,” Niamh O’Mahony, Secretary of the Irish Supporters Network , said. “The reasons why are also important to highlight – fans think about their clubs’ finances, football being their main pastime and football being a social outlet. That sense of community and belonging is key. The League of Ireland is underpinned by the dedication of supporters and volunteers and, as one respondent said, fans and passion drive this league more than anything . That same passion has been largely missing from grounds for the last  months. She continued: “Feedback from the games in the second half of  was really positive in terms of the clubs implementing public health measures and ensuring fixtures were run in a safe and organised manner. ISN, CRISC and YBIG Mandate have been meeting with the FAI regularly on this issue to ensure the voice of supporters is heard and taken into account in the ongoing Return to Stadia work. The data also speaks for itself – not a single Covid- outbreak was linked to League of Ireland games or training in , and clubs, volunteers and supporters can all take credit for that.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Fermanagh teenager signed from Irish Premiership side Ballinamallard until Thursday, July  and has played in all three of the Candystripes warm-up games so far. Glynn, who is in the first year of his Environmental Planning course at Queens University Belfast, has played under Declan Devine in the IFAs Club NI developmental pathway. In his early days, Micheaacutel played for Enniskillen Rangers before moving to Ballinamallard for the next six years, including two in the first team and being part of the squad beaten by Crusaders in the  Irish Cup Final. googletag.cmd.push “I was on the bench and disappointed not to get on, but nothing I can do,” Glynn points out. “I was playing soccer up to U with Club NI and Northern Ireland Us in the Euros. Whenever I got in to do my A-Levels, I didnt have as much time for soccer.” He is also a talented Gaelic footballer. His attacking prowess helped his school St Michaels Enniskillen to prestigious MacRory and Hogan Cup titles in . It attracted the attention of Fermanagh senior manager Ryan McMenamin, but Glynn turned down offers to join up with the Erne squad to concentrate on his soccer career. googletag.cmd.push “Declan got in contact with Ballinamallard manager Harry McConkey and I had worked with Declan through the IFAs Club NI system for a couple of years at U and U,” Glynn told The Derry News. “When he heard the Ballinamallard season was null and voided, he gave Harry a call to seeI would be interested in giving it a go until July. It was an open offer, so I couldnt turn it down and in July, Derry can either offer me a contact full time or I can go back to Ballinamallard.” Glynn joins other signings Marc Walsh, Will Patching, William Fitzgerald and Joe Hodge ahead of Derrys league opener, away to Longford next Saturday.     Just three days after his arrival at the Brandywell, Glynn played  minutes in the first game, a goalless draw against Bray, followed by another  minutes in a - draw with Finn Harps and half an hour last Sunday against Bohemians, another game ending goalless. “I have been training nearly every day, as much as I can. Im trying to get the minutes in because its been a while since I have played soccer,” points out Glynn, who hasnt featured since Ballinamallards pre-season. “At the minute, I am enjoying it and its going well so far,” he adds. At the minute, it involves a -mile round trip from his home in Derrygonnelly. “The team are training four mornings a week and Im in for all of them, it changes every week with the friendlies. I am in no set routine, but hopefully when the season starts Ill get into a routine and be more settled.” Glynn speaks of the buzz in the Derry camp, with the hopes of getting their season off to a winning start against Longford, who were promoted from the First Division after a - win over Shelbourne last season. “Its exciting, there is good hunger in the squad to succeed,” Glynn said of his progress so far. “I have played with a few of the lads before and they have been great and very welcoming. “It is a very young squad, there are a few lads who have been there and done that and they are setting a great example. Declan has been telling us to learn from them as best as you possibly can.” “For now, it is a matter of keeping pushing, keep the head down in training every day and see what comes of it. Hopefully things go well.” Derry lost - at Dundalk in last seasons opener and chase a first winning start since their - win at home to UCD in . In the last  seasons, the Candystripes have won their first game on four occasions, drew - with Shamrock Rovers in  and last the other five.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I told them there was no way Kildare were going to beat us on our own patch. We were down a few men because of injury, but we beat them. We won all seven games in a group that also saw us play teams like Leitrim, Carlow, Tipperary and Longford. We met Derry in the league quarter-final that April in Breffni Park. They hit us with two early goals and at one stage, led us by - to -. But once we got going, we played well and Derry didn’t score again. We beat them by a point, - to -. I think Tommy Ryan got his jaw broke in that game. We played Clare in the semi final in Croke Park. They were Munster champions and going well but we came through to qualy for a league final meeting with Dublin. We played reasonably well against the Dubs, although not as good as we would have liked. They had a man sent off, I think it was Charlie Redmond. We were level going into the final few seconds and right at the end, Barry Cunningham was making his way towards goal when the Wexford referee, Brian White blew for full-time. It was back to Dublin again the following Sunday for the replay. We played poorly. Even though they had Tommy Carr sent off, they beat us by four points, - to -. Ulster Championship In the first round in Ulster, we beat Antrim in Ballybofey. They were hungry and full of running but Martin McHugh was brilliant for us and we beat them by three points. That put us into the Ulster semi-final against Armagh. It was back to Breffni Park again. Armagh were a good side and it was a really close game. I put Michael Gallagher and John Duffy in towards the end and they helped us battle for a draw. The following week, we were back for a replay. Kieran McGeeney had made le dficult for Martin McHugh in the first match, so I decided to play Martin at full-forward in the replay. McGeeney followed him in, but he wasn’t suited in there and we got in for a couple of goals. Duffy had a fine game and we won comfortably, - to -. The Ulster final that year will be remembered for the state of the pitch after endless showers in Clones. Even the week beforehand, there were concerns about the state of the pitch in Clones. But that day, the rain was awful. We were late for the match because of traffic delays. And in the minor match beforehand, one of the Tyrone players suffered a broken leg. I seem to remember us considering not fielding at all. It didn’t seem right to be playing a game in such conditions but the Ulster Council were having none of it. They insisted the game would go ahead. We were down a lot of men that day because of injury. I had no Rambo Gavigan and Donal Reid was also missing out of the half-back line. Anthony Molloy wasn’t fit to start because of injury and we were without Tony Boyle too. I started John Duffy and he’d a good game. But in hindsight, I probably should have gone with Tommy Ryan that day. Remember he’d suffered a broken jaw, but he would have been well suited for that game. James McHugh Derrys Johnny McGurk shake hands after the  Ulster Final.We led - to - at half-time, but the second half belonged to Derry and in particular, Anthony Tohill. He was simply outstanding. I brought Molloy on late in the game, but by that stage, Derry had done enough. They beat us by two points, - to -. We only got one point in that second half. After the game, there were big celebrations among the Derry fans. I got struck twice after the final whistle by Derry supporters. I remember Jackie Reilly, Eugene McHale and my nephew Terry coming over to me, ‘cause they saw I was surrounded by Derry supporters. It was one of those things. In fairness, one of those supporters who struck me came and apologised to me some time afterwards. I didn’t say much about it at the time. It was just one of those things that happened. I actually met up with Eamonn Coleman ahead of their All-Ireland semi-final in which they would play Dublin and we talked tactics. We would both give our all on the sidelines in games, but with Eamonn, once the whistle blew at the end of a match, all was forgotten. Derry went on to win their first All-Ireland at the end of that season, and I was delighted for them. That day as we left Clones, we were deeply disappointed. Remember, these lads had given plenty of years to the county jersey at that stage. I was thinking that perhaps the time was up for myself as manager. But on the bus home, Anthony Molloy came up to the front where I was sitting and asked me to give it another year. I wasn’t really sure what to do, but when Anthony asks you to stay, it’s hard to say no.

After reaching the league final, their hopes of retaining Sam ended in the rain in Clones.Our first game after our All-Ireland win in  was against Kildare in the league in Ballybofey.The GAA was changing the structures of the league, so that season, there were four groups of eight teams and we were in Group B.Ourselves and Kildare would end up first and second in the group which put us through to the league quarter-finals.I’d been on holidays in Majorca and arriving back into Donegal that day, it was straight to Ballybofey.Kildare were a good side that season and I remember going out onto the pitch before the match and who was out there ahead of me butMick O’Dwyer.I knew Mick well, and the way he looked at me when we shook hands, I just got the feeling he was out to beat us that day.I went back to the dressing room and reappraised things with the lads.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Closing.jpg","title":"Closing date nears over Irish Street development  ","story":"THE planned redevelopment of the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick takes an important step forward next month.That is when developers will be formally asked to submit their bids to redevelop the site which stretches as far back at St Patrickrsquos Avenue and also includes a number of empty buildings adjacent to the former police base and the Irish Street car park.Five developers and  community groups have expressed an interest in the site with its regeneration being spearheaded by the Department for Communitiesand Newry, Mourne and Down Council.A draft development brief mdash paving the way for the regeneration of the sprawling site mdash is expected to be formally signed off shortly, once lawyers for the government department and local authority have had an opportunity to examine and approve it.Developers will then be given up to  weeks to submit their proposals with a final assessment made around September, leading to the selection of a preferred bidder who will be responsible for all planning and construction costs.Once a developer has been selected, he will be given a year to secure planning approval and to complete the regeneration of the site within three years.Moving forward, there is an acknowledgement that the current Irish Street car is badly laid out and that the redevelopment proposal provides an opportunity to address this, paving the way for it to be used for future events, markets and festivals, with the DfC and local council prepared to provide additional funding to allow this to happen.Some members of a working group, which includes council and DfC officials, Downpatrick councillors and business community representatives, are also keen to see work carried out to help make Downpatrick town centre pedestrian friendly to help ldquoencourage creativity and attract more visitors.During a recent meeting of the group it was confirmed that it is hoped to retain all the spaces at the car park and also redevelop the facility into a welcoming feature.The working group will also be given the first opportunity to review the scheme proposed by the chosen developer which is designed to regenerate the heart of the town centre.An entrance to the development site from Lynn Doyle Place has been suggested, with the developer encouraged to engage with residents who live at this part of the town.Signicantly, developers interested in the prime town centre site are being asked to focus on how their chosen scheme can potentially contribute to Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy post Covid, providing a boost for residents and help attract visitors to Downpatrick.While it has also been suggested extending the perimeter of the regeneration site this has been ruled out as a non-starter as it would serve to delay the planned redevelopment.In the near future, as part of continuing work on the Irish Street revitalisation programme, graphics will appear on the front of the former police base, while the archway at the entrance to the Irish Street car park will be painted.A progress report on the Irish Street scheme was outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee and has been welcomed by Cllr Dermot Curran.He said he hopes the timetable which has been outlined will be realised to provide a major boost to the social and economic regeneration of Downpatrick town centre and has welcomed the emphasis on helping revive the night time economy.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe opportunity to redevelop a huge swathe of town centre land will not happen again and it is important that we get it right for everyonersquos benefit. The redevelopment plan has the potential to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the town centre economy for decades.News of progress to redevelop the town centre site comes after recent confirmation that the location is one of a number of high profile schemes included in a real estate portfolio designed to attract potential national and international developers and investors.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local councils which are part of the Belfast Region City Deal consortium and is hoping for a share of a near poundbn Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive investment package.As work to secure city deal funding continues, the local authorities which form the consortiumhave come together to launch a new portfolio of real estate development opportunities within their respective areas with the aim of attracting global investment, boosting tourism and creating sustainable regeneration.The Irish Street regeneration proposal is one of  schemes being showcased in the so-called Belfast Region Investment Guide which have been identied by the ious councils. The portfolio details potential uses for each site with the guide used to market the development opportunities to developers and investors, both locally and overseas.City Deal members say the compilation of the portfolio is the next step in the progression of the consortium with the overriding aim of creating more and better jobs and attracting investment.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure money from the city deal for a multi-million pound flagship tourism project in Newcastle, with the so-called Mournes Gateway proposal a series of ambitious projects which includes a gondola ride into the heart of the Mourne mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Council.jpg","title":"Council 159% rates rises third lowest in province  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has imposed the third lowest rates rise in Northern Ireland.The above inflation .% hike to fund the local authorityrsquos poundm budget was unanimously agreed last week by local politicians who described the increase as ldquofair and balanced.New figures confirm that the rise was the the third lowest across the provincersquos  councils, while three local authorities mdash Antrim and Newtownabbey, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid Ulster mdash froze their district rate.The smallest increase of .% was made by Mid and East Antrim Council with the second lowest imposed by Fermanagh and Omagh Council mdash .%.With Newry, Mourne and Down in third spot in terms of the lowest increase, fourth place went to Derry City and Strabane Council which increased its rate by .%.Belfast City Council hiked rates by .%, while Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon sanctioned a .% rates rise. Ards and North Down Council agreed a .% rise, which equates to an extra pound a month for ratepayers.The highest increase of .% was imposed by Causeway Coast and Glens Council will see average household bills increase by pound..The majority of councils have have agreed to increase annual rates bills which are calculated by combining the district rate which they set with the regional rate set by Stormont.While the Northern Ireland Executive has frozen the regional rate for households and businesses for the coming year, Stormont finance minister, Conor Murphy, has outlined a poundm rates support to businesses in the new financial year. He had also urged local authorities to also freeze their district rates.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is to create two new funds to help the district recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus.The Covid revitalisation fund is designed to help the business community, with the local authority also establishing an economic recovery reserve as the district plots its way out of the global pandemic.The local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year represents an increase of pound.m on last year with the rates rise meaning that homeowners with a property valued at pound, will be paying pound. more a year or  pence a month.The organisation also has poundm in its cash reserve.Politicians say the .% increase is needed to cover the cost of delivering economic regeneration, planning services, leisure and community facilities, refuse collection and street cleansing across the district over the next year.Council chief executive, Marie Ward, said when the organisation struck last yearrsquos district rate, it had no concept of the challenges it would face over the following  months due to the global pandemic.She said Covid- had presented ldquosignicant financial challenges to all councils, with Newry, Mourne and Down no exception.Mrs Ward said the local authority was able to sustain many services and play a key role in responding to the pandemic, moving quickly to make its services safe.ldquoWhether it is supporting businesses through virtual workshops, helping residents stay active or connected during lockdown, working with community partners to get help to our most vulnerable residents, or carrying out environmental improvements works in our towns and villages, we have not stood still, she said.With infection numbers reducing and the coronavirus vaccination programme gathering increasing pace, Mrs Ward said that ldquoambitious thinking is required now more, welcoming progress on major plans to regenerate the district which will help bolster the local economy.The chief executive said the local authority has progressed business cases for both the Newry City Centre Regeneration and Gateway to the Mournes projects, while working with its Belfast Region City Deal partners, on progressing number of regional innovation and skills programmes which will produce benefits for the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10Mar2021-Covid.jpg","title":"Covid cases increase locally  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK and Ardglass are included in a list of  postcode areas in Northern Ireland which have recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases between March  and .Out of  people tested,  positive cases were confirmed on Monday by the Department of Health.The news comes after visitors again flocked to Newcastle and other popular beauty spots across the district last weekend, but the numbers in some other areas were not as high as reported the previous Saturday and Sunday.Police confirmed that last Sunday that they were made aware of reports of traffic congestion and parked cars causing an obstruction within the vicinity of the Trassey Road and Burrenreagh Road near Bryansford.There were also issues at the Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the town with a number of tickets issues to drivers for causing an obstruction, while cars were prevented from entering Castlewellan Forest Park on Sunday afternoon for a period as paramedics and the air ambulance crew responded to a medical emergency.Police had promised that they would be providing a ldquovisible presence in the Newcastle area in particular and had asked motorists to adhere to the designated parking areas provided. Cars parks across the resort were full for most of the weekend.People who live in the resort are particularly concerned that with the deadly coronavirus still in circulation, such a large influx of visitors has implications for public health.Local politicians had also highlighted the need for people to continue exercising social distancing and adhering to public health advice, insisting that there was no room for complacency at this crucial time, despite and increase in positive Covid cases across the district and the roll-out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials had met with police ahead of another anticipated busy weekend in a bid to signicantly reduce the number of visitors, with council officials placing cones in the Tollymore and Bryansford areas, with others located at Carrick Little near Slieve Binnian and in the Mournes.In addition, police set up a number of rolling checkpoints on the main approach roads to Newcastle last weekend, with officers also deployed in the heart of the resort.Police also managed parking at the hugely popular Bloody Bridge area on the outskirts of the resort, expressing concern that some drivers had shown little care or attention for pedestrians or other road users by the way they had parked their vehicles, one of which was a Transit van.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke, has praised the response from PSNI, local council, the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the emergency services and others for their response to managing visitors to main tourism hotspots.He said there was a greater presence on the ground which has been welcomed by residents following the ldquodangerous level of visitors who flocked to Newcastle and other ious parts of the district the previous weekend.ldquoI welcome the co-operation between all the ious agencies to improve the safety of residents, continued Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe local council placed traffic cones in a number of areas popular with visitors, while the PSNIhad vehicle checkpoints at main arterial routes into Newcastle area. There were also a number of mobile police patrols in the resort, with tickets issued to motorists for causing an obstruction at a number of areas including the Trassey Track and Bloody Bridge.Cllr Clarke said these measures helped ease the pressures on what he described as ldquonatural environmental treasurers as the district moves into the Covid recovery phase.He added: ldquoIt is clear that extra resources are required to manage and maintain our rights of ways, forests, beaches and our parks. The local council and PSNI will continue to share social media messaging on restricting travel to within  miles, with police confirming that they will continue to remain active across the entire district, not just Newcastle.Many people took to social media after another busy weekend to ask why visitors from outside the district who had travelled quite a few miles were not stopped and sent home.

So I started to think about what I could do and this is where the business came from.After  years of working with adults with learning disabilities, Louise came up with the idea of creating sensory boxes.ldquoRiley is registered blind and is deaf, so he needs a lot of sensory input. I came up with the idea of providing affordable sensory toys and products for children who need them, explained Louise.ldquoAs a special needs mum, I find thatyou go online to find sensory toys, they are hugely expensive.ldquoIrsquove spent four years buying stuff for Riley and I have a good idea of the things that you wouldnrsquot necessarily buy as a sensory product, but that will provide a similar sensory experience.ldquoI tailor my boxes to the child and find out about their sensory needs to determine what type of things would help them, such tactile items or fidget stuff to help with concentration and children who are hyperactive, or visually stimulating items such as light-up toys, calming products or growing products for a darkened room. There are so many sensory needs out there.Louise has been supported from the Go For It Programme in association with Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Louise sells mostly through her Facebook page and word of mouth recommendations.ldquoI put up a post on Shop Ireland and I wasnrsquot really expecting the numbers of responses that I got. In the run-up to Christmas I had  orders. I had to turn people away, she explained.The support of the Go For It programme was a key part of the impetus to get the business up and running.The programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Irelandrsquos wide network of enterprise agencies and provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise.Louise joined the Go For It scheme through Down Business Centre and was able to access training.ldquoIt gave me the expertise in what to concentrate on first - I went and saw the accountant and got registered, she says.ldquoI was a bit apprehensive because I had absolutely no business experience, just a good idea. But the project gave me the reassurance that it was a good idea and we have put together a business plan.ldquoJoan OrsquoHara has helped me massively throughout the last few months and continues to be available for guidance should I need it or would recommend the best people to talk to in the subject I need.More recently, Louise has got her mum involved, branching out into making tactile and fidget cushions which are suitable for dementia patients and people with ADHD, autism and anxiety.Cllr Laura Devlin, chairwoman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council said: ldquoThe Go For It Programme provides new entrepreneurs with accessible, free and tailored support in the start-up stage of her business in areas such as financial and business planning, and sales and marketing to help get their business up and running.ldquoI wish Louise every continued success in developing and growing her enterprise and encourage anyone thinking about starting their own business to get in touch with the Go For It Programme.Joan OrsquoHara, business advisor at Down Business Centre added: ldquoItrsquos great to see Louise doing so well with a product that will undoubtedly support a childrsquos development through sensory play.If you have a business idea yoursquod like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time. Jim always said that % of winning was done in the workshop before the race meetings.ldquoJim was very much a self-made man with an independent pattern of thought and kept his motorcycling hobby quite separate from his business interests, Alan explained.ldquoWhile he preferred not to align himself with any dealership other than David Brown Tractors, for whom he did development work and sold numerous new and second-hand tractors, he steadfastly refused to repair road going motorcycles.Alan revealed that it was Jimrsquos love of motorcycles and an interest in tuning and modying British machines, a process later adopted by manufacturers like BSA, Norton and Triumph in the s that earned him a much-envied reputation.He said James was ldquoalways extremely modest about his dramatic successes as he was happy developing innovation after innovation in his own workshop.ldquoJim was certainly well ahead of his time when explaining in simple terms that engines had to be enabled to breathe easily to make them perform better, Alan explained.ldquoHis new thinking about breathing, valve and camshaft design, carbureation and compression ratios brought phenomenal output at , rpm from an ordinary production BSA machine when the company was the worldrsquos biggest motorcycle producers in the mid-s, long before the surge of Japanese two-strokes.Many years later, Alan said he still finds it hard to understand that Jim Brown was given motorcycles by leading manufacturers with an instruction to keep them winning at world class level, which is exactly what he did.He also revealed that a lot of Jimrsquos ideas were incorporated into the BSA cc Victor machine that Jeff Smith used to win the motocross world championship in  and .Alan revealed that in earlier years, Jim provided Irish champion road-racer Wilfie Herron with a race-bike, as he did for Ian McGregor, Campbell Gorman and Tom Herron.ldquoHailed as a wizard, he personally tailored the BSA bikes which brought Mervyn McConkey so much success on grass tracks and motocross events throughout Ireland, he continued.The Crossgar man said that when Jim lost interest in the motorcycle industry because of its domination by Japanese-built machines, he turned to Cosworth, who employed him as a consultant.ldquoJim became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve cylinder engine and cylinder head, and was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head from the Williams Formula One team, said Alan.ldquoThrough my friendship with Jim and his we Minnie and their sons John and Junior, I met some wonderful people. Jim was great friends with the Rev Harold Good who latter became the Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, while I helped the Brown family run motorsport events in the Martin and McCormickrsquos quarries in the eighties in aid of the Ballynahinch Methodist Church building fund.Mr Brown passed away in  with a huge number of mourners making their way to Ballynahinchrsquos Lough Inch cemetery, including leading names from the world of motorsport including Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.ldquoI will always remember Jim as a great innovative, pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative.

It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The final decision on the way forward will be taken by Mr Weir who met via Zoom with a delegation of parents and St Patrickrsquos Grammar representatives last Wednesday.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos is opposed to the merger, while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are in favour of the plan going ahead.Members of St Patrickrsquos Board of Governors have urged parents, past pupils and the public to respond to the ongoing consultation, asserting that the outcome ldquowill have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.The Board of Governors and school management say they do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process and insist that they are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.De La Salle High School says the merger will ensure that families in the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority, while St Maryrsquos High insists that an all-ability school can cater for the gted and talented and also support children who need it.Mr Harvey said he was delighted to be able to secure the meeting with the education minister on behalf of St Patrickrsquos representatives and the ldquomany concerned parents who have contacted him on what he described as ldquothis important issue.He said has been working with them over recent days to ensure that their opposition to the current

him in respect of many of the key issues on the ground that, I believe, make the current amalgamation plans wholly unworkable, said Mr Harvey.ldquoThe plans, as proposed by CCMS, would reduce academic choice for parents and children from Downpatrick and the surrounding areas.ldquoIt would deny many Catholic schoolchildren the opportunity of attending a local selective Catholic grammar school and the proposed intake criteria would place children living in the rural areas beyond the urban Downpatrick area at a severe disadvantage in terms of the likelihood of being offered a place.Mr Harvey is

True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit. I believe he still wears it on special occasions.The following week at Johnnie Grantrsquos Ramble Inn at Ballykilbeg, Frankie threw a big party for all his friends in the sport. I was lucky enough to be invited and it was a great night. Former amateur and top local funny man Terence McKeag was acting as MC. Frankie took to the stage to play the guitar and sing.Thankfully, Frankie has not been lost to the sport as he is now an officer at point-to-points, as well as being the inspector of courses. He is also a qualied steward at meetings north and south.Also at Tyrella in  there was a local winner in the two-winner race with Moving Statue, trained at Banbridge by Leo Young and ridden by Alfie Evans winning for Dromara owner David Hanna.The six-year old geldings race saw Ian Buchanan ride his own Some Day Soon to success and the Douglas and Cromie Maiden race was won by Mrs Stuart Catherwoodrsquos Bad Boy, ridden by Paddy Graffin.In the open race, Pyral, owned and trained by Moirarsquos Therese OrsquoNeill, and ridden by Graeme Martin proved to be too good for the hot favourite Mill Park Bay, ridden by Pat Kelly.At the Warwick meeting on Friday, Downpatrick jockey Caoilin Quinn recorded his first success for an outside stable when he won the racingtv Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle on the   favourite Eaton Miller, trained by R Potter.Despite the fact that the race was for conditional jockeys, Caoilin was again listed on the card as a Mr. He had been a professional at this stage since early-January.This is something that does not make sense as, at present, amateur riders are unable to compete and sadly will not be able to do so at the Cheltenham Festival.They have always been a big feature of the action there, with so many Irish riders involved. Top riders like Patrick Mullins, Derek OrsquoConnor, Noel McParlan, Jamie Codd, and Barry OrsquoNeil are as effective as any professional.They are working with horses every day of the week, so it is a big disappointment for them and many others.Congratulations to Cumbria- based Downpatrick jockey Danny McMenamin on riding his th career winner.

In fact I have never thought a structure to Scotland likely. Traffic levels are a fraction of those crossing the English Channel, which links London and Paris, both of which alone have a population larger than Northern Ireland and Scotland combined.On a radio discussion some years ago I applauded the ambition of a tunnel to Scotland but said it would not happen for + years. That timescale was met with surprise But I have seen how long it has taken to deliver far simpler schemes. I first started taking an interest in the inadequate road links between Belfast and both Dublin and Londonderry in the s. More than  years later, both roads are still not full expressways . The road from Cairnryan Stranraer to the English border, the A, is even worse and is single carriageway for almost all of its  miles.Some politicians also call Boris Johnson’s bridge tunnel ‘fantasy’. It isn’t. It might well be an attempt to distract political attention from his Irish Sea border, but it is plausible.

Why  \"The News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee. Scroll down to find out moreWell because the royal family have shown themselves to be top-class, A list entertainers. They are like the Kardashians but with fewer booty shots and more ermine. Fair enough, unlike the Windsors, we don’t actually have to pay for the Kardashians, but let’s give credit where it is due.We’ve endured a year of non-stop Covid news and anxiety-inducing briefings by Robin Swann and Michael McBride. But this week the entire nation temporarily forgot about the C word as the royal family delivered revelations, allegations and retaliations. There was a jaw-dropping family psycho-drama, a high class celebrity spat. Who made who cry  Who said what to whom  There was a potential constitutional crisis and best of all there was the most passive-aggressive use ever of the phrase “some recollections may y”.I must admit I have found the whole thing hilarious and an unprecedented and hugely welcome ersion from grim reality. TV audiences were huge. Clips, jokes and memes abounded on social media. Newspaper salesincreased dramatically – though as an aside, hats off to the Irish News who relegated the royal story to page  below more important stories like ‘GAA player likes playing GAA’.Some serious issues were of course raised by all these majestic antics. So people took to Twitter. And there, they debated racism, the legal precedents for assigning imperial titles to babies and Oprah Winfrey’s hairdo. And the discussions had all the high-minded depth, intellectual rigour and kind consideration of alternative views that you would expect from a medium that permits a maximum of  characters per tweet. So I say we keep the royals. If only for the entertainment value. And let’s face itwe scrapped the royal family and instead had an elected president, Brexit Britain would probably make it a toss-up between Nigel Farage and Piers Morgan. And no nation deserves that.Amidst all the allegations of institutional discrimination one thing was overlooked. As a CatholicI am unable to become King. The Act of Settlement of  still bars Papists like me from ascending the throne. I’ll be honest, this blatant block on my career prospects hadn’t particularly troubled me before. Frankly the number of princesses throwing themselves at me has been slightly less than the number of Catholics celebrating Rangers winning the Scottish Premier League . But it’s the principle that counts. So after completing this column I will immediately be writing to Oprah to demand my two hour interview.• The PSNI have launched an ‘investigation’ in to alleged breaches of the Covid regulations by celebrating Rangers fans on the Shankill Road this week. In line with similar investigations, Operation Look at the News Footage, should take about  months to complete, by which time Celtic may well have reclaimed the SPL, making any subsequent convictions of Rangers fans doubly painful. Rangers winning the SPL is of course a once in a decade event, so it’s understandable that their fans got a little exuberant. I should make it clear that whilst I am a football fan myself, I genuinely do not follow and have no interest whatsoever in Scottish football. As Kevin Bridges famously said “Scottish football is a two horse race, and we’ve now lost a horse”. But as a football fan I get it. I get why the team I like doing better than team you like in an annual competition leads to unbridled ecstasy. But the Covid breaches were pretty blatant and indefensible.Thankfully my local team Cltonville have insisted on keeping their fans safe from this sort of thing by steadfastly refusing to win the Irish League. • This is the first column I have ever written for the News Letter and I was delighted to be asked by the world’s oldest daily newspaper to be a contributor. But this is Northern Ireland so when I told a few people about the column I was lambasted by a nationalist friend for ‘taking the soup’. He assumed that as an avowed unionist paper I would be subject to censorship. Nonsense. As I told my friend the editorial procedure is very simple. Basically I write my article. It is then sent to Ben Lowry to make sure there are no Irish words in it. Next it is passed on to the News Letter’s legal adviser — Mr J Bryson of Donaghadee — before final approval by the editorial committee, better known as the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland. It is a damning indictment of a ided Northern Ireland that my friend almost believed me.• Tim McGarry’s column will appear bi weekly in the News Letter on Thursdays from March ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However, he said that “we undertook to have some checks to prevent some goods from Northern Ireland going into Ireland” but he didn’t want “loads of checks” from GB to NI.Mr Johnson also claimed that he had supported the protocol “because it seemed to me to uphold the principles of the UK internal market” but admitted that there is now “an imbalance in the way the protocol is operating so as to affect the balance of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement”.Read More Read MoreBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says part...When askedhe could commit to the government not banning from Northern Ireland items such as sausages and soil, Mr Lewis said: “Look, that is absolutely what we want to focus on.

However, in that flurry of announcements it was largely missed that there was no end date associated to the reversal of what had been a total ban on British soil being imported, evena few particles were on a plant’s roots.One of the few people to notice that was former Ukip member Richard North, who wrote on his blog that the decision was dferent “in that it deliberately sets aside a provision on Union law listed in Annex  of the NI Protocol, which the UK government has agreed should apply to Northern Ireland”. Even though it was described as a “temporary operational measure”, and Downing Street had said it was part of “temporary, practical arrangements”, he highlighted that there was no end date.Last week’s guidance states: “Bulbs or vegetables that have been grown in soil can be sent from GB to NI eventhey still have soil attached.“Plants can be moved to NI with soil and other growing media attached, provided they are from an authorised business meeting GB plant passporting requirements for soil.”Other new red tape such as customs declarations remains.When askedthat decision was simply a grace period – delaying the inevitable – or was a permanent decision which will not be overturned, Mr Lewis said that the government had issued “a further guidance paper it’s not actually a grace period, so it sets out the arrangements for moving plants, vegetables, bulbs, machinery... they have soil attached.“But it’s not a grace period it’s a guidance piece so that is our guidance that is not a time-limited issue no.”When it was put to him that businesses such as plant nurseries need certainty that this is the law and it won’t be changing, he said: “Yes, and that’s why we’ve been able to issue the guidance on that. It still recognises the robust arrangements, so we don’t compromise biosecurity, etc, with the single epidemiological unit of the island of Ireland, but yes, that is our guidance, that is the position.“That point about certainty was also really behind the timing of the decisions last week because of what businesses were saying to us and confirmed after we took that decision that we had to do that to give them certainty for the weeks ahead, not just the months ahead.”:Sam McBride: Northern Ireland is now a proxy battleground for the EU and the UK – and that is dangerousTUV leader Jim Allister’s aide had messages between Jamie Bryson and Sinn Féin, court toldUnder cross-examination from loyalist Jamie Bryson, libel lawyer Paul Tweed refuses to name five Nama case clientsSam McBride: After darkness, light: Reasons for real hope as Northern Ireland vaccine rollout accelerates – but first expect political rowsBoris Johnson backs down as EU says no to demands to reduce Irish Sea border – and DUP says ask for more checks, not lessTwo thirds of GB retailers plan to stop selling to Northern Ireland by April because of Irish Sea border, survey findsUnionist leaders unite to go to court over Irish Sea border, arguing it breaches the  Act of Union and  Belfast AgreementSam McBride: Northern Ireland is in a breathtakingly undemocratic position which dishonest Boris Johnson knows is indefensible – yet he knowingly chose itSam McBride: Read the small print – the Irish Sea border may be impossible to remove, evenMLAs vote it downSam McBride: Shackled to Brexit, Arlene Foster can’t admit that it has been disastrous for Union – but Irish Sea border is radically reshaping NI——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But the encounter moved into territory which reveals something far more profound about this government’s thinking about the Northern Ireland Protocol which creates that internal UK trade frontier.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Just  hours after the new border began, Mr Lewis tweeted to say: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’”. Ever since, that tweet has hung like a millstone around Mr Lewis’s political neck.It was not a momentary slip. Rather, it was part of a strategy by him – on behalf of the government – to minimise the reality of the protocol.Perhaps reassured by the fact that Arlene Foster was in this period making clear that she had given up the political fight to prevent the creation of border control posts, the NIO had in October said on its official Twitter account in response to an article I had written: “There will be no border in the Irish Sea between GB  NI. The NI Protocol explicitly prevents the creation of one....”Alex Thomas from the Institute for Government later cited that tweet as an example of “increasing abuse of official communications”, and highlighted that government Twitter accounts “are funded by the taxpayer for the purpose of informing the public – not misleading them”.Given the scale of the new red tape – which is not yet being experienced in all its bureaucratic glory – I ask Mr Lewishe regrets what he said. It’s an obvious question, and Mr Lewis clearly has a prepared answer, saying that “it is a tweet that hasn’t stood the test of time as well as I would have hoped”.He frames it as somethingwhich essentially he believed at the time, with the government “looking to do the protocol in a way that consumersin Northern Ireland effectively wouldn’t see it, wouldn’t feel it, wouldn’t have an issue with it clearly that is not the lived experience on the ground and that is why we’ve taken measures over the last couple of months with the EU and obviously we took the measures unilaterally last week.”I ask himhe now believes that there is no Irish Sea border. He doesn’t answer, saying instead that “my focus is on getting to a position where consumers don’t have any impact in terms of having a dferential, in terms of the experience they have as a UK citizen in Northern Ireland as opposed tothey’re UK citizens anywhere , so that there is no real border at all – that’s got to be the aim”.Implicitly that accepts that there is now a border, but he goes on to say that his real aim is for Northern Ireland to “have a huge competitive advantage without any disadvantages, as an integral part of the UK”.Mr Lewis is mild-mannered, but there is an unmistakably bullish tone to many of his comments. He presents grace periods now not being for industry to adapt to bans and find alternative suppliers in the EU – as they once were presented –but for negotiating those bans out of existence.Whatthe EU says no  That hoary staple of ministerial answers – “I don’t like getting into hypotheticals” – is deployed, but he effectively does make clear that this is going to happen, eventhe EU objects, saying “We want to do this with the EU we want to find a way that works. With a bit of goodwill, we can work through that.“But ultimately, the Prime Minister has been clear – we want to ensure that the great Norfolk sausage or Melton Mowbray pork pie can be enjoyed anywhere in the UK, including Belfast.”Read More Read MoreBan on British soil entering Northern Ireland is over for good, says NI Secretar...He lampoons the EU thinking that chilled sausages need to be banned from Northern Ireland to protect their single market, saying “I personally don’t think that the great British banger is a greatthreat to the single market of the EU and I’m not sure that the risk of somebody smuggling a Norfolk sausage from Belfastto Dublin for sale is the biggest threat out there. So I’m cautiously optimistic we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”Butthe government doesn’t want the terms of the protocol to apply, why did it sign up to it Unconvincingly, he says: ”Well, one of the reasons there was a grace period was to get the permanent solution sorted out because it is complicated due to their single market issues and the phytosanitary check issues – we’ve got to use that to solve that problem permanently not as a clf-edge suddenly later in the year [where] you can’t source those products [form] wherever in the UK you want to.”The interview is suffused with the idea that the government thought the protocol would allow an unimpeded flow of GB goods into NI, despite the clear terms of what it agreed and its own assessments that there would not be an unimpeded flow.It is understandable why the EU is sceptical about this explanation, believing that Mr Johnson knew precisely what he was doing – and it was spelt out in detail to his negotiator, Lord Frost – during thelong talks.In the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: “I am determined, as the Prime Minister is, to ensure that the great British banger...will continue to be enjoyed by those who wish to do so across the counties of Northern Ireland in perpetuity.”The words “determined” and “in perpetuity” seem to commit the government to permanently disregarding the EU’s ban on chilled meat products such as sausages and pies coming from GB to NI.When askedthe government was prepared to act unilaterallythe EU refuses to agree to that, Mr Lewis is vague, saying: “Our focus is on finding a solution that means they can be enjoyed in perpetuity. “We’re prepared to do that but George Eustice and the team at DEFRA are working with the EU on that, the Cabinet Office team lead on the protocol to get the solution to that. The Prime Minister has been clear – he wants that solution so that we find a way forward. I’ll not be drawn on what may or may not happen because I’m optimistic that we’ll get a mutually agreeable solution.”But we are clear: People in Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom they should be able to enjoy products from across the United Kingdom in the same way they wouldthey were living in Cardf, Edinburgh or Great Yarmouth.”It’s an answer which seems to logically commit the UK to unilaterally acting in multiple areas, regardless of what the EU thinks.There has been debate, and conflicting briefingfrom dferent parts of government, as to whether Boris Johnson is trying to radically renegotiate – even tear up – the protocol, or whether he is committed to fully implementing it.Mr Lewis frames the government’s unilateral move last week in line with the latter category – that it was necessary to act urgently to shore up support for the deal: “If we had not taken those actions last week, I think the protocol would be potentially fatally flawed in the next few weeks.”He says that “supermarkets and others were saying to me... that we would have had some empty shelves again in the next couple of weeks not in April – because of their lead times it would have come arguably next week maybe this week, but probably next week”.In that situation, he says that the News Letter and other media outlets “would, quite rightly, have been writing about it and showing images of that as another problem with the protocol”.Even some subsequent agreement with the EU to extend the grace periods would not have resolved the immediate problem, he says, “and that would have been an untenable position”.Mr Lewis says that he had told Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney that “ we hadn’t taken these actions last week, we’d have been in a really dficult position for the protocol – and actually, it’s in everybody’s interests, particularly actually I would say the Irish government and the EU...that we find a way to make sure the protocol works”.He said that the protocol “has to work for all communities – and at the minute it’s not really working for any because whether you’re nationalist or unionist or someone who doesn’thave a constitutional view, as a consumer you are affected by the protocol...there is obviously on top of that, and I recognise this, an issue for unionists who feel that there is an impact on identity and I get that, I absolutely get that. I appreciate that some of them would like the protocol torn up, etc.“I might not agree with the outcome they want, but I understand why they feel that way. One of the ways we’ve got to do with our partners,you like, the EU – and the Irish government have a part to play in this – is to make sure that they do understand thatthe protocol is going to survive and work, it gets to that place where a consumer doesn’t notice it and Northern Ireland has this huge competitive advantage of being able to trade as part of the EU and freely with the EU - which would be a phenomenal competitive opportunity.“For that to work, the protocol’s got to work for all communities – the whole community.

It is judged on those awards and the quality of your signings, and wersquore proud wersquove managed to gain that title.ldquoPenarth is also home to drum and bass clothing brand Concrete Junglists which has become known worldwide, and High Contrast ndash who is a drum and bass icon ndash was born here.Talking more about how he got into the industry, Mr King said: ldquoI always wanted to be involved in the industry and realised by  I wasnrsquot going to make it as a musician.ldquoIt just wasnrsquot coming together and didnrsquot feel like it was me.ldquoItrsquos something Irsquom really passionate about but it started off as quite a light-hearted thing just giving away free music.ldquoThen it started to grow slowly and some people started to approach us, and then in  it just boomed with the top  acclaim. We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed. Itrsquos really exciting.ldquoI donrsquot think people living in Penarth really know about this townrsquos standing in the drum and bass industry. Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
