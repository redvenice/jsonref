A nine-figure sum each year – $100million – would add up to $1billion (£760million) over a decade.The couple have yet to say exactly how they will meet their ambition to \u0027become financially independent\u0027. But their unique stellar cachet – blending blue blood and Hollywood royalty – could net them huge amounts.The Queen yesterday made the historic announcement that Harry and Meghan would step back as senior Royals and split their time between Canada and the UK in an agreement to be finalised within days.Her Majesty made clear her deep disappointment at the couple\u0027s decision to quit their Royal duties and said there will be \u0027a transition period\u0027 while the final settlement between the Family and the Duke and Duchess is hammered out."},{"url":null,"title":"Inside Megxit summit Harry talked Queen story","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry in turmoil over cutting his royal links | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE Viscountess Weymouth sends Longleat team Australia help save koalas","story":"Share this article   We Need To Talk About Kevin author Lionel Shriver claims books should be made more readable in order to compete with today\u0027s television shows. \u0027It\u0027s so much easier to sit in front of the TV that, at this stage in the game, it\u0027s probably a good idea to make reading as easy as possible,\u0027 she declares. \u0027I\u0027m not big on obfuscation.

Culture Minister Helen Whately said she had \u0027met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction\u0027A public consultation on the issue was carried out between August and November 2019.Neil McArthur, the commission\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. \u0027The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.\u0027Research shows that 22 per cent of online gamblers using credit cards are problem gamblers, with even more suffering some form of gambling harm.\u0027We also know that there are examples of consumers who have accumulated tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling because of credit card availability. \u0027There is also evidence that the fees charged by credit cards can exacerbate the situation because the consumer can try to chase losses to a greater extent.\u0027         Gambling Commission boss Neil McArthur (pictured in an announcement today) said the ban \u0027should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have\u0027Mr McArthur said he understood some consumers used credit cards because of their convenience, but the risk of harm to others was too high to allow this to continue.He added: \u0027We realise that this change will inconvenience those consumers who use credit cards responsibly, but we are satisfied that reducing the risk of harm to other consumers means that action must be taken.\u0027But we will evaluate the ban and watch closely for any unintended circumstances for consumers. The ban is part of our ongoing work to reduce gambling harm. \u0027We also need to continue the work we have been doing with gambling operators and the finance industry to ensure consumers only gamble with money they can afford to spend.\u0027The Government has come under pressure to introduce bans for the use of credit cards for online bets over the past two years by charity groups including Gamble Aware and Citizens Advice.In 2018, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board (RGSB) called on the Gambling Commission to consider restrictions on the use of \u0027borrowed money\u0027 for online gambling.Early in 2019, the watchdog launched a call for evidence on the matter \u0027to explore the consequences of restricting or prohibiting the use of credit cards in gambling\u0027.An estimated 24 million adults gamble in Great Britain, with 10.5 million of those placing bets online.It is thought that around 800,000 people use credit cards to gamble, with the regulator\u0027s own data showing that more than 165,000 customers made £46 million worth of credit card deposits in February last year.         The Gambling Commission made the announcement this morning, with its Twitter post aboveThe announcement is the latest blow to gambling businesses, after the Government introduced a crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which saw the maximum stake for bets cut from £100 to £2.Last year Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport ministers also met with banks and gambling operators to discuss their concerns.They also looked at how companies could use technology and customer data to help those at risk of developing gambling problems, including those using credit cards.Culture Minister Helen Whately said: \u0027Whilst millions gamble responsibly, I have also met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction.\u0027There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them.\u0027In the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan. \u0027We have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include £100 million funding towards treatment for problem gamblers.         Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from\u0027\u0027But there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020. We will not hesitate to take any further action necessary to protect people from gambling harm.\u0027Adam Bradford, co-founder of the Safer Online Gambling Group, said: \u0027This is excellent news and it will provide an extra layer of support for people who are addicted to gambling.\u0027It has been a long time in coming and we are glad the Commission have acted decisively on this matter.\u0027The announcement comes amid a period of increased scrutiny on the gambling sector, which has seen criticism in recent weeks over its close relationship with professional sport.Last week, government ministers were told that the Football Association will not renew a controversial deal allowing gambling websites to screen live football matches.The sport\u0027s governing body faced pressure over its deal with Bet365 which allows people to watch live matches if they create accounts with the gambling firm.The Gambling Commission is also reportedly considering whether to clamp down on VIP schemes which can reward gamblers who habitually lose money with perks such as free bets, cashback on losing wagers or football tickets.         SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act\u0027Brigid Simmonds, chairwoman of the Betting and Gaming Council which represents the industry, said: \u0027The Betting and Gaming Council is a body firmly committed to raising standards, safer gambling and change.\u0027We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk.\u0027The use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.\u0027Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from.\u0027This is definitely a positive safeguarding measure that will help many people at risk of harm from gambling.\u0027And SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the gambling industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act.\u0027Gambling firms saw their shares slide in reaction to the new legislation to ban the use of credit cards for online bets when the markets opened.Online specialist 888 saw shares slide 3.3 per cent, William Hill shares fell 3.2 per cent, Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings dropped 2.8 per cent and Paddy Power owner Flutter sank 1.4 per cent in early trading."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal commentators verdict Sandringham summit Queens statement Harry Meghan","story":"Share this articleImagine if Meghan is selflessly saving Harry from a mental breakdown, says VANESSA FELTZ | Vanessa Feltz | Columnists | Comment | Express.co.ukPrince Harry\u0027s regret as \u0027transition\u0027 crisis damages family relationshipsRussell Myers: \u0027Any doubt over which royal remains in charge has been laid to rest\u0027 - Russell Myers - Mirror OnlineAs Harry and Meghan are finding out, the royals don¿t do ¿progressive¿ | Simon Jenkins | Opinion | The GuardianRoyal Family will engage in a careful balancing act to avoid the nuclear option for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | inewsHow did I get Meghan so wrong? | Coffee House"},{"url":null,"title":"Oprah Winfrey denies planning tell interview Harry Meghan","story":"Share this article A royal source said: \u0027Harry and Meghan\u0027s people have been reaching out to all the big US networks to explore the possibilities of a sit-down warts-and-all interview. \u0027Meghan feels she\u0027s been silenced and is no longer prepared to be muted.

The 23-year-old, who had come to Britain to improve her English, suffered catastrophic head injuries when she asked a stranger to take a picture of her against the backdrop of the Seven Sisters cliffs, in East Sussex.         South Korean student Hyewon Kim (pictured above), 23, fell 200 feet to her death from an East Sussex clifftop after jumping in the air for a photograph         The famous landscape around Seven Sister, Seaford (pictured above) where Hyewon fell from She did what countless others had done before her and jumped in the air for a photograph — but lost her footing as she landed and toppled over the edge.When police looked at her mobile phone, which was found lying at the top of the beauty spot, there were six photos that showed her jumping in the air \u0027extremely close\u0027 to the edge.\u0027Her concentration is not on anything other than what she is doing. The expression on her face shows nothing but enjoyment,\u0027 Detective Sergeant Tod Stewart told the inquest into the student\u0027s death.This followed an incident on New Year\u0027s Eve 2016, when a 17-year-old boy from Aldershot, in Hampshire, became the victim of a tragedy that may have been related to taking a selfie on the Paris Metro.         Nye Frankie Newman (pictured above), from Aldershot, who died on the Paris metro         Nye Frankie Newmans had previously posted this photo of his selfie in Hong Kong in 2016Free-runner Nye \u0027Frankie\u0027 Newman was on his way with his girlfriend and a group of friends to see the fireworks at the Eiffel Tower when he climbed between the train carriages, popped up his head for a moment and was struck by an object.His mother, Deborah, said at the inquest into her son\u0027s death that she had been told Nye was taking \u0027a selfie or video\u0027 when he was fatally injured.Then, in September 2017, came the death of mother-of-two Carmen Greenway. The 41-year-old graphic designer was cycling home after celebrating her mum\u0027s birthday at a pub when she took a smiling selfie. Moments later, she fell off the bike near her home in Isleworth, West London, fracturing her skull. She died days later in hospital.         Michael Kearns (above) had been taking selfies from a 100 ft- high wall in Portugal when he lost balance          Louise Benson (pictured above), 37, originally from Bristol fell to her death in PortugalIn 2018, Louise Benson, 37, originally from Bristol, and her Australian boyfriend, Michael Kearns, 33, plunged to their deaths in Ericeira, Portugal. They were taking selfies from a 100 ft-high wall over the beach when they lost their balance reaching for a dropped mobile phone.An inquest last year into the death of aspiring actress Bethany-Maria Beales, 22, heard she may have been trying to take a photo when she fell to her death from the 19th floor of a luxury apartment block in Moorgate, London.And last year, two young, British holidaymakers — Jayden Dolman, 20, and Daniel Mee, 25 — plunged to their deaths after trying to take a selfie on a cliff in a holiday resort on the Costa Blanca.              Bethany-Maria Beales (left) may have been taking a photo when she fell from a block in Moorgate (right)In 2018, there had been speculation over whether a selfie was to blame for the death of keen runner Andy Lawton, who fell from a cliff at a Welsh beauty spot. Council official Andy, 40, was spotted with his phone on the cliff near Nash Point lighthouse in the Vale of Glamorgan shortly before the tragedy.At an inquest into the death, his father, Barry, told the hearing that his son had \u0027a keen interest in his fitness\u0027 and was \u0027a bugger for taking selfies\u0027.Coroner Graeme Hughes told the inquest in Pontypridd that it was possible Andy might have taken a selfie, although the runner\u0027s family were unlikely ever to find out exactly what happened in the seconds before his death.         Andy Lawton (pictured aboce) enjoyed taking photographs on his regular runs, his father said he \u0027was a bugger for taking selfies\u0027         Nash Point near Llantwit Major in South Wales (pictured above) where it is believed Andy may have taken a selfie Last night, speaking to the Mail, Mr Lawton said it was by no means clear that a selfie had been to blame for his son\u0027s death. But he added: \u0027Having gone to visit Nash Point, I found the area to be very vulnerable to accidents happening and there are very few, if any, signs warning of danger.\u0027There should be warning signs at beauty spots known to be dangerous — and maybe, if people take no notice of the signs, you do need \u0027no-selfie zones\u0027.\u0027Many experts and tourism authorities would concur.The researchers behind the 2018 global study recommended that \u0027no- selfie zones\u0027 should be introduced at dangerous spots in popular tourist areas to make them safer. These would include at the tops of mountains, tall buildings and by lakes.The most common cause of selfie tragedy is drowning, followed by transport accidents and falls.Other causes of selfie-related death listed in the study included wild animals and firearms.In May 2018, a man was mauled to death by a bear in India after trying to take a selfie with it. And in the U.S., selfies with a bear in the background had become such a phenomenon by 2014 that the Forest Service was forced to warn people of the danger of getting too close to the animals.In 2015, five people were gored by bison in Yellowstone National Park in a three-month period. Three of them had been taking photos. \u0027No picture is worth hurting yourself, others or the park,\u0027 visitors to Yellowstone, in Wyoming, are now warned. \u0027Be aware of your surroundings near wildlife, thermal areas, roads or steep cliffs.\u0027In Pamplona, Spain, officials have gone still further. Since 2014, taking selfies has been banned, punishable by a fine, during the city\u0027s controversial bull runs.At a similar event elsewhere in Spain, a 32-year-old man left the spectator area to take a selfie with the charging bulls and was gored, dying in hospital from his wounds.Sometimes, the danger is rather less obvious. In 2016, a man in China was killed in a wildlife park as he tried to take a selfie with a walrus. The businessman had been taking videos and pictures to put on his social media account when the one-and-a-half-ton walrus grabbed him from behind.While women take the most selfies, men, it seems, go to greater extremes for the perfect snap and so account for three-quarters of selfie deaths.The selfie boom has been with us for more than a decade, but really took off when Apple introduced the front-facing camera on its iPhone 4 in 2010.Now, front-facing cameras are commonplace, as are \u0027selfie sticks\u0027 (pictured left) and the filters beloved of the Instageneration.Samsung has predicted that the average millennial will rack up some 25,000 selfies throughout his or her lifetime. But as self-snapped photos have risen in popularity (the word \u0027selfie\u0027 was added to the dictionary in 2013), so has the pressure to capture a picture that will take the internet by storm.So just what is driving this dangerous trend?Social media and celebrity psychologist Dr Arthur Cassidy says an obsession with getting the \u0027perfect picture\u0027 means young selfie-devotees are often oblivious to the risks they are taking.Antics that people pre-social media would never have dreamt of are now commonplace. And it\u0027s all, says Dr Cassidy, about getting a pat on the back from peers.\u0027These young people taking dangerous selfies are looking for attention and validation. They are competing in one-upmanship to see who can get the most \u0027likes\u0027 and the most powerful social media identity in their peer group.\u0027Their end goal is to increase their status in their own mind. They see dangerous pictures as a legitimate pathway to huge success on social media — \u0027look at me. I am who I am and nobody can get a better picture of me than I can myself\u0027.\u0027The more spectacular and colourful the picture, the greater the shock value. They don\u0027t realise they are doing something wrong and foolish and dangerous.\u0027Or, as another commentator puts it: \u0027Social media is an attention economy where there are hundreds of thousands of pictures, so young people are often willing to take risks to have a shot that will catch others\u0027 attention.\u0027Rooftopping, for instance, remains a trend. As its name suggests, it involves dangling off high-rise buildings and grabbing a picture for social media posterity.But, as barely a month passes without another person dying in pursuit of the perfect snap, perhaps it\u0027s time we looked again at selfie-mania and asked whether that killer shot is really worth the risk."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/14/22/23403230-7887773-image-a-57_1579040930675.jpg","title":"Teenagers dismembered corpse young man Dublin field","story":"Share this article The discovery comes amid concerns over a missing teenager.

I know all too well why middle-aged men are tempted into such absurdities and women into different but quite comparable follies of their own.Your mid-40s are the point at which you find yourself saying: \u0027Is this it?\u0027 And at which you hear the doleful answer from the universe: \u0027I\u0027m afraid it is.\u0027Your mid-40s are when you know, beyond even the slimmest of long shots, that you will never sing Born To Run in front of 100,000 screaming fans at Wembley Stadium.It\u0027s the point at which the Booker or Nobel Prizes, the Victoria Cross, the keys to No 10 Downing Street, the screenwriting career, the six-figure salary, the global admiration and esteem, the secure sense of having made a contribution to the world which will both credit and outlive you — all of those things start to slip out of view.It\u0027s not that people your age and older don\u0027t manage all those things. Bruce Springsteen is 70, after all. But the overwhelming majority of them don\u0027t and the ones that do tend to have put the hours in long before this point.In other words, you have left it all a bit late — most likely because you were watching old episodes of Inspector Morse or playing Candy Crush on your smartphone. And now you are where you are, with dwindling reserves of time to accomplish your dreams and dwindling reserves of energy to fulfil them.         It\u0027s not that people your age and older don\u0027t manage all those things. Bruce Springsteen (pictured) is 70, after allYou didn\u0027t paddle hard enough when you had the chance, and now your legs are tired and the waters are moving faster and the temptation to give up is overwhelming.You are defeated. You have measured out your life in coffee spoons, as T.S. Eliot put it, and you are what Ben Elton used to call \u0027a farty\u0027. You\u0027re an ordinary person, just like all those dreary characters you used to think were the supporting cast in your drama. And you are deeply unfree. Like Gulliver on the beach in Lilliput, you are tied to earth by a thousand tiny ropes.There\u0027s all the stuff you own. Where did it come from? Why is it cluttering up your life? The other day I discovered — as someone who does not use an iron from one year to the next — that I own three of the bloody things.If I had the energy, I\u0027d take two or more of them to the dump. But, instead, they join the redundant pasta-maker, the never-used juicer, the jigsaws with missing pieces and the incomplete under-tens chemistry sets in the spare-room gadget graveyard. You spend your time worrying about the mortgage, or the composting collection.Because you have young children, you tidy the kitchen four times a day and it never seems to get actually tidy. You become dismayed by your own toenails. You clean your glasses over and over again because you can\u0027t quite admit that the blurriness is caused by your eyes rather than a smudge of grease on the lens.You bicker with your spouse about paint colours and the hanging of pictures in the loo. And you love your children but they absolutely drive you up the wall.Nobody does what you ask them when you ask them, and everyone wants something from you, all the time. A glass of water. Help with homework. Toast sliced diagonally rather than on the square.Even the cat — which has peed on the sofa for the third time this week and is overdue a visit to the vet from which no traveller returns — is miaowing for another dish of food half an hour after you gave her the last one.Then there\u0027s that glorious moment when you\u0027ve done all your chores and are settling on to the one sofa the cat hasn\u0027t peed on — only for the washing machine to go \u0027Peep! Peep! Peep!\u0027 to tell you to get up and start hanging up the laundry.Plus, obviously, there\u0027s sex. You don\u0027t have as much of it as you once did. You\u0027re not as good at it as you once were. And far fewer people — including your spouse — find the prospect of having it with you especially appealing.Where once the sight of an attractive person sparked lust or excitement in you, now it sparks a twinge of nostalgia.And, ah, vanity: the paunch, the receding hairline, the dimming eyes. Men and women alike are, for the most part, biologically programmed to think that this sort of stuff is important.Our self-esteem is bolstered by the glad eye of another — and as we sink into sexual invisibility, happily coupled up though we may be, that\u0027s a hard thing to get used to.And there\u0027s death. Here you are, closer to the end than you are to the beginning. What used to be an abstract notion has started to feel a bit more real.Your parents — whose immortality used to be a comforting given — may already be gone or they\u0027ll have started looking a bit frail. Perhaps you\u0027re already comparing twinges and minor ailments with your father.You\u0027re turning into your parents and they are turning into old people and you can see all too clearly where this particular plotline leads.But here\u0027s where the rubber meets the proverbial road. In terms of the renowned Kubler-Ross stages of grief, your 40s are when you go through anger, denial, bargaining and depression — all of which are followed by acceptance.You ask \u0027Is this it?\u0027, you get an answer in the affirmative, and you set about learning to love it for what it is rather than resenting it for what it isn\u0027t.You recognise, as your sense of perspective broadens and grows, that nothing matters very much and very little matters at all.That what will both credit and outlive you is, if you have them, those same children you find so overwhelming now.That the esteem of your friends is a steady flame where the glad eye of that hot 20-something is a brief sparkle. And that Nobel Prize wouldn\u0027t have meant a hill of beans anyway.Or that\u0027s the theory. So on the other hand: yippee!Just another 14 months or so and it\u0027ll all be over. I\u0027ll get happier, and happier, and happier — and just as I reach my peak happiness, I\u0027ll drop dead. "},{"url":null,"title":"Victorian era 5 gold coin showing 20 year old Queen leading lion sells record 530 000","story":"Share this article          It depicts Victoria as Una, from the Elizabethan poem The Faerie Queene by Edmund Spenser. The reverse carries a portrait of the monarch (pictured)The reverse carries a portrait of the monarch.Only 400 of the gold coins, designed by William Wyon, chief engraver at the Royal Mint, were struck.The piece, described as \u0027a truly stellar example of one of Britain\u0027s most iconic and beautiful coins\u0027, was sold by a private collector through US-based Heritage Auctions, in Dallas, Texas.It had been expected to fetch £190,000 but eclipsing the previous record of £421,000 for one of the coins in 2017."},{"url":null,"title":"Railway bosses blasted celebrating expansion Lincolnshire sausages Yorkshire","story":"Share this article          A spokesman for Grantham-based Watkin butchers (pictured) added: \u0027I don\u0027t see how LNER can call a Yorkshire sausage Lincolnshire\u0027A spokesman for Grantham-based Watkin butchers added: \u0027I don\u0027t see how LNER can call a Yorkshire sausage Lincolnshire.\u0027I\u0027m sure it will be tasty but LNER could just call it a Yorkshire sausage.\u0027The rail firm insisted its recipe was for an authentic Lincolnshire sausage – with its unique blend of sage and white pepper – but admitted it was made by a Yorkshire contractor.An application by the Lincolnshire Sausage Association to give Lincolnshire sausages protected status was turned down by the government in 2012."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d9b05fd9db4c4f5b4997661749d4ff1e6659d16/333_0_8418_5052/master/8418.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d80a836394fe0829ca0d4a3b7d4a0f4a","title":"buy a classic sport photograph olga korbut seeks perfection","story":"The latest of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryOlga Korbut’s performance on the uneven bars at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, pictured here by Gerry Cranham, was a thing of beauty. The 30-second display featured what became known as the “Korbut flip” – an inconceivable, whirling sequence in which she daringly backflipped off the high bar, then propelled herself backwards off the low bar via her hips. It was so innovative that when the judges scored her routine 9.80 out of 10, placing her second overall, there were howls of disapproval from the crowd.

In addition to the eponymous label, the company also owns PrettyLittleThing and Nasty Gal.Boohoo’s chief executive, John Lyttle, said the group enjoyed “record trading” in the last four months of 2019. “All of our brands have performed exceptionally well and delivered strong market-share gains,” he said as the group increased its sales and profit expectations for the year to 29 February.At a time when many established high street brandssuch as M\u0026ampS, Topshop and New Look are struggling, Boohoo has succeeded, thanks in part to its use of social media influencers, instead of glossy magazines, to reach shoppers.It has also acquired a series struggling brands, including MissPap and most recently Karen Millen and Coast. They were “showing great promise” under Boohoo ownership, Lyttle said, and were helping to broaden the group’s appeal.Moody’s did not alter M\u0026ampS’s current Baa3 rating – which is one rung above junk status – but changed the outlook from “stable” to “negative” to reflect its struggle to stabilise profits, which have been falling for several years.Moody’s senior credit officer said the M\u0026ampS management team faced “significant” headwinds in their attempt to reverse falling clothing sales and improve profit margins in the food business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb7a0bd508535c1a00fa2c3e49b84bb669ab573/0_150_6612_3967/master/6612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f3e8f19af9dbaf4466886a6546e2d3f","title":"flybe saved after successful last ditch talks","story":"Treasury’s pledge of tax review and delayed HMRC bill reportedly pushes shareholders to commit more cashThe immediate future of Flybe was secured on Tuesday night after ministers agreed a rescue deal with shareholders to keep Europe’s largest regional carrier flying.The package of measures includes a potential loan in the region of £100m andor a possible short-term deferral of a £106m air passenger duty (APD) bill, plus a pledge to review taxes on domestic flights before the March budget.After the spectre was raised of another UK airline failure, Flybe’s owners Connect Airways – a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic – were persuaded to commit millions more to cover ongoing losses.The government is still in negotiations to finalise any loan to Flybe, and although Treasury sources denied reports that it had agreed to defer outstanding APD, it is understood that HMRC could allow the airline a short-term extension to settle its debt.The deal was condemned by British Airways’ owner IAG as “a blatant misuse of public funds”. Chief executive, Willie Walsh, accused Virgin of “wanting the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their mismanagement of the airline”.Any government loan would also attract EU commission scrutiny for breaching state aid. However, the EU approved loans made last September by the German government to save Condor, a subsidiary of the Thomas Cook Group, when the UK allowed its sister airline to go bust.The Treasury will also face the wrath of environmental groups after it announced a review of APD, a tax that adds £26 per passenger to all Flybe domestic return flights, to “ensure regional connectivity is strengthened while meeting the UK’s climate change commitments to meet net zero by 2050”.An additional review has been promised to examine how else regional transport connectivity can be improved. The Treasury said: “In light of these discussions Flybe have confirmed they will continue to operate as normal, preserving flights to airports such as Southampton, Belfast and Birmingham.”Air passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates – effectively for economy class, premium economy and businessfirst-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from £13 in economy to £78 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of £528.Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays £13 in APD.Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, said: “I welcome Flybe’s confirmation that they will continue to operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of the UK.“The reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy. They will ensure that regional connections not only continue but flourish in the years to come – so that every nation and region can fulfil its potential.”Lucien Farrell, chairman of Connect Airways – the parent company of Flybe – said: “We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government’s recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK. As a result, the shareholder consortium has committed to keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives.”Flybe’s chief executive, Mark Anderson, said: “Flybe is made up of an incredible team of people, serving millions of loyal customers who rely on the vital regional connectivity that we provide. This is a positive outcome for the UK.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said his department would undertake “an urgent review into how we can level up the country by strengthening regional connectivity”. He said it would look at all the options to ensure airports could continue to play an important role in driving economic growth.The government had been urged by MPs, unions and business to save Flybe, which serves almost two in five domestic UK flights and employs more than 2,000 people. It carries 8.5 million passengers a year between 56 airports across the UK and mainland Europe, and is the main airline at regional airports including Belfast, Southampton and its Exeter base.The deal came after a day when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged that the government was “working very hard to do what we can” for Flybe and avert a further airline collapse so soon after Thomas Cook. The Conservatives had committed in their manifesto to improve regional connectivity.The pilots union, Balpa, welcomed the news. General secretary Brian Strutton said: “This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe.“The government is to be applauded for stepping up to the plate to help one of the few remaining independent UK airlines and a vital one at that.”The company’s pleas for help to survive the winter came less than a year after it was taken over by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, with Stobart and Cyrus Capital, after posting recurring losses of around £20m per year.Flybe has long struggled financially, and the fall of sterling since the 2016 EU referendum has piled additional pressure on UK airlines, with major costs such as fuel incurred in US dollars.The airline has argued it is particularly hard-hit by APD, which is charged on each passenger on a flight taking off in the UK. While all short-haul economy flights, including domestic, are charged at the same rate – £13 – the tax is applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return Flybe flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while the duty on a Glasgow to Malaga return costs half that.Potential moves to ease APD were condemned by environmental groups. The MEP for South West England – a constituency that includes Flybe’s Exeter home – Molly Scott Cato of the Green party, said it was “absurd to suggest that we should provide a further boost to the aviation industry”. She highlighted that routes deemed socially necessary could be subsidised under EU rules – Flybe’s Newquay to London route is already funded with state aid.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “The government cannot claim to be a global leader on tackling the climate emergency one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel cheaper the next. Cutting the cost of domestic flights while allowing train fares to rise is the exact opposite of what we need if we’re to cut climate-wrecking emissions from transport.”Flybe flights were operating as normal on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/688e61cab9e3e846839ffbe6f7b232596cbac466/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd9652c40c182f03c097e312c22d4fb1","title":"blackrock now needs to use its voting clout to fuel sustainable investing","story":"It’s good news the world’s largest asset manager aims to change how it invests but actions will speak louder than wordsBlackRock’s conversion to sustainable investing comes late in the day and may have been motivated, in part, by founder and chief executive Larry Fink’s fear that the “greenwasher” label would stick. Activists were banging on BlackRock’s door. Fink’s treaties on the importance of companies having a “purpose” had become tired. Even some clients were saying BlackRock’s claim to be “engaging” on climate issues was feeble.So let’s not imagine that the world’s largest asset manager, with almost $7tn under its roof, has suddenly become a pace-setter. In the eyes of many big European fund management houses, most of Fink’s declarations on Tuesday will have sounded wholly conventional. Viewing climate change as “a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects”, as he put it in his “dear CEO” letter, is a mainstream position.Equally, though, let’s not be too churlish. BlackRock made some solid commitments. In its actively-managed portfolios, it will ditch companies that derive a quarter or more of their revenues from thermal coal, one of the most polluting energy sources. It will launch new investment products that screen for fossil fuels, thereby giving loyal clients more scope to move their money.BlackRock will also push companies to disclose their climate risks according to widely accepted standards. It has joined the influential Climate Action 100+ group of investors, which closest rival Vanguard refuses to do. It now believes sustainable investing is “the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward,” which is a critical statement from a fund manager with a fiduciary duty to aim to generate good returns for investors.Voting, however, was the area where Fink’s letter was vaguest. BlackRock has attracted a pile of criticism for its pusillanimous record on climate resolutions but the new approach merely said the firm will be “increasingly disposed” to vote against uncooperative boards. What does that mean? Fink would seem to have granted his fund managers an awful lot of wriggle-room.Therein lies the continuing frustration. It is clearly good news that Fink is talking about “a fundamental reshaping of finance” that will make it easier for trustees to win internal battles over investment polices. But the missing ingredient is a sense that BlackRock is willing to use its voting clout to upset powerful interests. Fink can allay that doubt by action – but “increasingly disposed” does not sound like a battle cry.Flybe is saved – sort of. Actually, it’s hard to tell from Tuesday’s late announcement whether the troubled airline secured a meaningful handout from the Treasury. A government promise to review air passenger duty “to ensure regional connectivity” is not the same as a firm commitment.Flybe’s controlling consortium, led by Virgin Atlantic, seems to have heard enough to stick some more cash into the business to keep flying for now. The quantity was not specified but a willingness to invest was a minimum requirement to be taken seriously. Virgin \u0026amp co bought Flybe less than a year ago, so it’s a bit soon for buyer’s remorse.The government needs to tread carefully. Yes, regional connectivity is important, so there’s a case for subsidising vital routes if absolutely necessary, as happens on the London-Newquay route. But scrapping passenger duty to save Flybe itself would be absurd. And if, in fact, Flybe is receiving a state loan or tax deferral, the terms need to be transparent.Credit rating agencies do not have a monopoly of wisdom, as we discovered in the banking crisis when they awarded top scores to mortgage-backed derivatives in the US that turned out to be toxic. All the same, Moody’s threat to downgrade the debt of Marks \u0026amp Spencer to junk status is embarrassing for the retailer.Junk status in the eyes of a grownup rating agency would be another milestone in a long decline – and, actually, more significant than being overtaken by Boohoo in stock market capitalisation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f796da93264206701cb23ce7ed5d84982486fd83/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd171590b87f3a7dced37fc041638dc","title":"trust politics public mistrust labour","story":"We’ve all heard it. I’ve heard it – on doorsteps, in the back of cabs and in cafes. “Politicians,” people will say, “you’re all the same.” Now, I balk at anyone who compares me to the blond baboon who is our current prime minister, but there is no doubt that trust in politics – and in politicians – is at an all-time low.People just don’t believe we’ll deliver what we say we will. They don’t believe we want to listen or to understand their lives. And they don’t believe we are able to do much to make their lives better. Lots of factors have contributed to this: the expenses scandal, the rise of fake news and, let’s be honest, too many politicians either telling lies (don’t get me started on the £350m for the NHS) or not giving a straight answer when they’re asked a straight question.A decade of Tory austerity has stripped away vital services and hollowed out high streets. Millions of people have simply lost faith in the ability of government to make their lives better. They’re angry about decisions made far away by people they don’t think have much of a clue about the stresses and strains of their daily lives.All of us in the Labour party should be concerned about the growing gap between voters and the politicians they elect to represent them. Not just because we’re democrats but because listening to people, being bothered about their lives and being rooted in their communities, is the only way we will win again. Our challenge is to restore both trust in Labour as a party of government and trust in democracy as the best means of delivering what the public wants. It’s a big task – but here are six things I would do to achieve this.First, we need to be honest, even if that’s uncomfortable. On social care we need to be clear that looking after the elderly will require people to contribute more in tax. When we’re asked whether immigration is too high, instead of fudging a response, let’s say what we think: no, it isn’t. The public isn’t stupid – people know when we’re trying to avoid saying something.Second, we need a new approach in order to reach decisions on long-term challenges. On climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more. Citizens’ assemblies are increasingly used around the world to build consensus. In Ireland, they helped pave the way for the historic changes on abortion, while in Poland they improved government response to major flooding. It’s time we used them here.Third, we need to recognise that people want more control over how decisions that affect their local communities are made. The UK is one of the most centralised countries in the world. While a step in the right direction, the “northern powerhouse” risks bypassing my region of the West Midlands and focusing solely on a handful of cities. Lisa Nandy is absolutely right that we need to devolve economic power away from Westminster and learn from what Labour councils around the country are doing.Fourth, we need people to feel their votes count. Under our first-past-the-post system, almost half of those who voted (14.5 million people) did so for a candidate who lost. Many who live in “safe” seats have given up on voting altogether. So, as well as long overdue Lords reform, we need to reform our electoral system so that parliament better reflects votes cast.Fifth, people should be automatically enrolled on the electoral register, as happens in countries such as Sweden and Finland. Inidual voter registration has meant millions of people are either not registered or are registered at the wrong address. If we reduce the minimum voting age to 16, as we should, then people could be auto-registered when they are issued with a national insurance card.Finally, if people are to trust our electoral process, we urgently need to combat fake news during campaigns. Apart from Twitter, which has banned political adverts, the social media giants aren’t stepping up. The result? A recent study found that nine in 10 of the Tories’ online ads during the election contained “misleading” information. We need a new public body to regulate online political ads, funded by a levy on the cost of purchasing the advertising space.These ideas might sound radical to some, but to me they’re just common sense. Unless we modernise the way we do politics, more and more people will give up on the idea that their participation is meaningful. Politics can change the world – but only if we change politics.• Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley and party leadership candidate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

They embrace change in a way I would find very difficult,” he said, name-checking Billie Eilish and Greta Thunberg.After years of showing the women and men’s collections together, it was the first time since 2016 that Gucci showed a largely male-only show. Which goes against the trend for many fashion shows to be mixed but also illustrated the designer’s ongoing exploration of masculinity through his clothes.The press notes for the show, which were presented on lined school notepaper, featured a treatise against toxic masculinity and a plea for a kinder, more feminised maleness. “It’s time to celebrate … a baby man able to do bold and playful somersaults … who wonders in amazement when the world becomes new.”The show, called Rave Like You Are Five, marked the half decade anniversary of the appointment of Michele, who has had a huge influence on menswear, shifting the emphasis towards romantic flourishes and feminised, Maximilian glamour.Michele has helped Gucci have a bigger cultural impact beyond fashion, influencing pop culture through celebrities such as Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky. It has also become a lightning rod around issues of ersity and representation in fashion. Gucci was widely criticised for selling a blackface jumper and during a show in September a model staged a mental health protest on the catwalk after straightjackets were used in the collection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e67cb1c0c26388552ed543ebd016554750db234b/2883_53_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16d432242390131402be15c610592db0","title":"scientists cite parasite factor in beard attractiveness debate","story":"Scientists say women who are more repulsed by lice are less likely to find beards attractivePrince Harry sports one, Justin Trudeau has recently grown one, and Brian Blessed’s is almost its own being. But are beards attractive? As the old adage goes: “Depends on the man, depends on the beard.”Now researchers have found there might be another factor: whether a potential partner fears there might be something living in it.Scientists say women who are more repulsed by the idea of lice, fleas, ticks and other such ectoparasites, are less likely to find beards attractive, possibly because such pests might carry diseases.“This is likely to be the case for the majority of our evolutionary past.,” said Anthony Lee, of the University of Stirling, a co-author of the study. “In modern times, with increased grooming and overall better hygiene, this link between hairiness and carrying ectoparasites may no longer exist, but the evolved tendency may still persist.”Whether facial hair boosts men’s pulling power or is a turnoff has long been a matter of contention, but previous research from the same team found women rate bearded men as a better bet for a long-term relationship.Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, researchers from the University of Queensland, and the University of Stirling, report how they asked 919 predominantly heterosexual women to rate the attractiveness of three male faces for both potential short and long-term relationships.Each face was shown with and without a beard, and with five levels of “masculinity” – while beardedness is seen as masculine, the trait includes a range of other features such as a thick jawline, a prominent brow, and deeply set narrow eyes.The women also completed a set of questionnaires which measured attitudes including their revulsion in response to parasites that live on the body, and their desire to become pregnant.In general, women deemed masculine-style faces more attractive than feminised ones. The same trend was seen for both short and long-term relationships and whether bearded or not, although differences in attractiveness relating to masculinity were less pronounced for bearded men – possibly, the team say, because the beard can hide some “unattractive” features.For each level of masculinity, bearded men were deemed more attractive than clean shaven men, a result found for both short-term and, to a slightly greater degree, long-term relationships.But not everyone was drawn to a hairy face. Among other results, the team found that women who had higher levels of disgust for ectoparasites found beards less attractive, although the reverse was true for those concerned about picking up harmful bacteria or viruses.While the latter link was weak, the team write: “This could be interpreted as evidence that facial hair is preferred as a marker of health among women with high pathogen concerns, or that facial hair masks areas of the face that would communicate ill health.”Whether participants were aware of a small study published last year that suggested men’s beards might harbour more germs than dog fur was unclear.The study has limitations: all of the male faces were of northern European ethnicity, and most of the women were white and lived in the US. It is also not clear whether the results would hold for gay men, or women of other sexual orientations.Lee said that despite the findings men should stick with what they were most comfortable with. “I wouldn’t base the decision to grow a beard on the results of a single study,” he said.Christopher Watkins, from Abertay University, Dundee, an expert in social judgments of faces, who was not involved in the study, suggested further studies might explore whether men chose to cultivate facial hair if it were deemed sexier.The authors of the study reveal that previous research into London fashions suggested facial hair was more common when there were more men than women available in the marriage market.“The research advances work on inidual differences in women’s attractiveness judgments, in this case, by focusing on facial cues that men can easily change – beards – in addition to how ‘masculine’ his face looks,” said Watkins. “Findings such as this might raise interesting questions in future about the uptake and nature of male grooming practices for example if different men from different cultures or regions are responsive to the high or low ‘value’ of a beard in making a good first impression.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8f8c3c9301d4813b2eec5bf44003addfd6e919/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b28f2aa4515473534f72b0a382ade88","title":"cats the goldfinch oscarbait movies academy 2020","story":"This year’s nominations have shown love for Joker and 1917 but a host of awards-primed films have been left out in the coldGiven a splashy premiere at the Telluride film festival, one of the most discerning of all the fall festivals, early word suggested that Motherless Brooklyn could return Edward Norton to the Academy’s good graces. But the three-time nominee’s long-gestating passion project (a starry adaptation of Jonathan Lethem’s award-winning noir) was ultimately more of a vanity project, complete with a mannered, almost parodic Norton central performance. It wasn’t a complete disaster but it felt like the kind of competent Miramax prestige pic that would have been pushed in 2003 and forgotten about by 2004.Clint Eastwood has developed an impressive habit of sneaking into the awards race at the last minute, dropping films late in the day, often speedily made yet always finely crafted. It’s a strategy that’s paid off on a number of occasions – Million Dollar Baby, American Sniper – but last year, the sterling credentials of awards-friendly fact-based drama Richard Jewell weren’t enough to make a mark. The film, which tells the story of the security guard falsely accused of planting a bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, received solid reviews but also faced controversy over its inaccurate portrayal of a female journalist, alleging she swapped sex for tips. Audiences responded with apathy and the film gave Eastwood one of his worst-ever openings. As Jewell’s mother, Bates scored a supporting actress nomination at the Golden Globes and the Oscars but it’s a poor showing for a film that was aiming for so much more.When the fact-based legal drama Just Mercy premiered at last year’s Toronto film festival, complaints about its by-the-numbers storytelling were outweighed by both the film’s undeniable emotive power and praise for Jamie Foxx’s turn as a man wrongly accused of murder. He was seen as an instant lock for best supporting actor but as we edged closer to awards season, the film, and Foxx, started to lose steam. He picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination but was shut out elsewhere and the film’s late release strategy meant that for many, it was unfairly buried underneath contenders with a more distinctive edge.Rushed by the director Tom Hooper in order to meet an Oscar-friendly release date, Cats was unleashed in such a shoddy state that a tweaked cut was shipped to cinemas just days after it went wide. Quite why Universal thought a plotless musical populated by nonsensically named CG monstrosities would appeal to voters is a mystery but the reception for the film was so bad that the studio removed it from its “for your consideration” roster soon after it tanked. Even Taylor Swift’s original, but forgettable, song couldn’t claw its way into this week’s list of nominees. The lessons should hopefully be clear: not every well-known IP should be resurrected, Tom Hooper can’t be trusted and, most importantly, don’t fuck with Cats.Like Just Mercy, Dark Waters took an aggravating real-life legal case and turned it into an involving, sturdy film – and like Just Mercy, it also failed to make a convincing enough argument for inclusion to Academy voters. A muted thriller about a staggering case of corporate negligence, it acted as more of a call to action than a fully formed movie, with the director Todd Haynes and stars Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway mostly coasting. It’s the kind of story that viewers have become more accustomed to finding on Netflix and its underwhelming box office suggests that the small screen might be where similarly plotted stories belong in the future.Reuniting the stars of The Theory of Everything, Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne and Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones, the ambitious period adventure The Aeronauts was sold on the strange assertion that audiences would care about seeing the pair together again. But while the Stephen Hawking biopic made an impact upon release, it’s not a film that’s stuck in the years since and Amazon’s ballooning semi-biopic was deflating for a number of reasons. A restrained release – the film was originally set to be on Imax yet ultimately in most territories reserved to streaming only – and polite, if unenthused, reviews meant that it couldn’t work as either a mass market effects extravaganza or an awards-friendly critical darling.On paper, so much suggested that a prestigious adaptation of The Goldfinch would be a natural fit for the Oscars, from the award-winning cast (Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, Sarah Paulson) to the Pulitzer prize-winning source material from Donna Tartt to a director whose last film, Brooklyn, was feted by the Academy. But when it came to the film itself, based on what’s been called unfilmable source material, Warner Bros granted it a token Toronto film festival premiere just days before it crash-landed into cinemas with one of the year’s worst openings and some of the season’s most hateful reviews.One of the many surprise snubs from this week’s Oscar nominations was the exclusion of the blaxploitation biopic Dolemite Is My Name. At this stage of the season, most hadn’t predicted it to figure in the best picture race but Eddie Murphy, who had been figuring heavily in the circuit, was seen as a strong contender for best actor. It’s a disappointment with a number of possible explanations: an unusually stacked category, some ill will toward Murphy for prior behaviour and also a refusal from some Academy members to take comedians seriously (Adam Sandler’s career-best turn in Uncut Gems was also left out in the cold)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45b7d7664f209045873f0851ce860bd0664b5aa/0_91_6557_3934/master/6557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d1e622800b6fa0e9b8db7a111172c6","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury selection","story":"Harvey Weinstein faced fierce opposition in a Manhattan court on Tuesday to his attempt to have the next critical stage of jury selection in his rape trial conducted behind closed doors.The New York district attorney leading the prosecution of Weinstein, Joan Illuzzi, was joined by several prominent news outlets in objecting to a defense demand that the jury pool be sequestered when they are subjected to inidual questioning by legal teams this week.Such a move would exclude all media and public from the proceedings, casting in secrecy the final steps taken to produce a jury for the eagerly awaited trial.Weinstein’s legal team made the demand last week, arguing that unless the potential jurors were questioned in private the film producer would not be assured of a fair and impartial trial.Defense lawyers have made numerous attempts to call for an adjournment on grounds that the jury pool is being tainted – from objecting to the sounds of women chanting an anti-rape anthem outside the courthouse to protesting about comments made by the judge in ordering Weinstein to stop using his cellphone in court.The second phase of jury selection, known as voir dire, is expected to start on Thursday and involves potential jurors being grilled by both defense and prosecution lawyers about their backgrounds and experience in the hope of flushing out any prejudices.Both legal teams can then remove up to three people from the jury pool without giving an explanation.Weinstein faces five counts relating to the allegations of two women that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. They include two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sex act.In her response to the court, Illuzzi objected to Weinstein’s attempt to have voir dire held in secret. “The procedure employed in this case is fair and reasonable. There is simply no authority for the proposition, advanced here by the defense, that exposure to pre-trial publicity requires inidualized, sequestered voir dire,” the prosecutor said.Lawyers representing the New York Times, the New Yorker, Daily News, Associated Press and other news outlets also filed a response objecting to Weinstein’s motion.They said that contrary to the idea that publicity would be harmful to the movie producer’s case, “Mr Weinstein and his counsel have sought to make their case through the media”.The news organizations point out that Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, has spoken to several publications and TV stations including Newsweek, ABC and CNN."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38b4b5f8f711e3cbe7672f641bcb89125130c34f/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0239544e1884f5416e76d6f6e660167","title":"true history of the kelly gangs justin kurzel there is always room for new stories about familiar legends","story":"Searching for an original way to tell the Ned Kelly story steered its director away from realism and into the realm of mythical reinventionIn Monegeetta, Victoria, a town east of Mount Macedon and about an hour’s drive from the Melbourne CBD, a small group of people – including myself – are standing on muddy ground in the cold, outside Mintaro, a brick Italianate mansion built in 1881. Its spectacular features include a three-storey tower and Doric columns positioned at its imposing entrance. It is beautiful – and very creepy.Our eyes are glued to two television monitors. They are displaying feeds from cameras positioned inside, where the Mintaro’s decadent vibe is countered by a Dogs in Space kind of scuzziness – its grime-splotched walls and faded wallpaper suggesting the place has seen better days.This is the set of Justin Kurzel’s new film, True History of the Kelly Gang, the director’s scorching take on the legendary outlaw that brings a visceral, punkish energy to its source material, Peter Carey’s acclaimed novel of the same name. The scene being filmed is a relatively quiet moment for such an in-your-face production, depicting Ned (up-and-comer George MacKay) meeting his adversary, Constable Fitzpatrick (Nicholas Hoult), for the first time.Usually film set visits sound much more interesting than they are. A few years ago, for example, I spent eight long hours on the set of Thor: Ragnarok, observing many people fussily prepare shots that each lasted for about four seconds, capturing cast members who seemed to be posing rather than acting.Kurzel’s set in Monegeetta couldn’t be more different. The takes are long and differ every time, giving the actors space to develop their performances and the camera operators opportunity to experiment. Watching it feels a lot like live theatre.Speaking over a cup of tea during a break in filming, the South Australia-born auteur tells me that rather than being deterred by the numerous Ned Kelly movies that already exist, he felt they forced him to “think of things in different ways – to really aggressively try to find a new voice. That’s been a very deliberate thing throughout the process: to keep it feeling alive and fresh to keep it feeling like it is walking along a tightrope.”Some of the film’s most striking scenes involve Ned and his gang wearing dresses, which was an element in Carey’s book. It is not without some historical basis: Kelly gang member Steve Hart, for instance, is known to have worn dresses in order to ride horses undetected.Grant continues: “You know that history aficionados will say ‘that didn’t happen!’ But you can’t please everyone. And who really knows what happened back then? I’m all for messing with it and playing with it. There is always room for new stories about familiar legends. You just need to find a clear point of view.”That point of view involves a move away from realism into a meta space. References to legend, myth-making and the idea of fulfilling or escaping destiny are strewn throughout True History of the Kelly Gang (a title which, as is the case with Carey’s book, is ironic).Ned’s mother Ellen (Essie Davis), for instance, compels her son with lines such as “be who you are meant to be!”. There are occasions when Ned feels incentivised to take control of his personal narrative: “Every man should be an author of his own history,” he decrees. But there are also times when he seems resigned to the idea of never controlling how he will be remembered, on one occasion glumly noting that “a myth is more profitable than a man”.Cast members articulate the film’s approach to these self-conscious elements in different ways. Davis, for instance, tells me the story is “all about curses” and “trying not to become what you are cornered into becoming”.“There is of course a difference between the life of Ned Kelly and the legend, the story everybody wants,” Kurzel says. “He became bigger than what he was. We somehow found a way to use him to create an identity for what we are, and what we are not.”For MacKay, who plays old buckethead himself – without (gasp!) a beard – embracing the legend involved forgetting about Ned Kelly’s status as one of Australia’s most iconic, larger-than-life historical figures.“A legend is what other people made of him,” says MacKay. “He probably wasn’t a legend in his own time, so I play him as a guy who just happens to be called Ned Kelly. A bloke whose actions became – and stood for – something else. A man who became, in the end, a fridge magnet.”• True History of the Kelly Gang is in Australian cinemas now and will be available to stream on Stan on 26 January. It is released in UK cinemas on 28 February"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2888268b7bcbd6e96ecdafafd051541567ae78ec/0_406_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed1cd7d4ff0d7a34cef09bd22a390ffd","title":"part time veganism the fewer animal products i ate the less i wanted them","story":"As a restaurant critic, I thought adopting a plant-based diet would be hard, but what started as an experiment quickly became a lifestyle choiceIt’s 2020. We all know the world is melting and we need to do everything we can to help the environment. I already walk everywhere, try to grow my own vegetables, eat seasonally, shop local, try to have zero food waste, have a worm farm, compost, host a beehive, bring my own bag and refuse to use takeaway cups, but for some reason I never switched to a plant-based diet. I know that it is the easiest thing you can do to stop putting stress on the world from an agricultural and an ethical standpoint – with an obvious side effect of overall carbon emission reduction.But it is hard. For me, it is hard because I write about food for a living. I write about restaurants and bars and aside from the obvious need to eat butter, cheese, meat and other non-plant-based things while reviewing, alcohol isn’t plant-based either. You know the reason why your Campari is red? Beetle shells. That wine you’re drinking? It’s been fined and filtered with eggshells and fish products. And though some people might, a food critic cannot subsist on vodka and unfined, unfiltered wine alone.But that’s no excuse. There are 21 meals in one week and for me only three are reviews. I also know the contents of my fridge (butter, eggs, stock, yoghurt, congee) and I need to be realistic about how drastically I can change my diet. So three months ago I decided that for three days a week – nine meals – I would eat vegan.I thought that just because I don’t drink milk or eat meat at every meal, I was pretty good already. I was wrong. I am that asshole who does all her meal prep at the weekend so I have at least five days of breakfasts, lunches and bases in the fridge. I had no idea how heavily I relied on eggs for breakfast, how much butter I consumed and how much I relied on stock-based meals until I stopped cooking them.Since the environment was my primary motivation for adopting a partial vegan diet, I set myself some rules.1. No processed foods. This meant no fake cheese, spreads, mock meat or any of that factory-made “food” that requires a lot of energy to produce. The most processed food I allowed myself was tofu.2 No grains that have been unethically sourced. I’m looking at you quinoa. When we went through the big quinoa boom, production ravaged Bolivia. Also food miles. The only quinoa I’d be eating had to be locally grown. Cheap? No, but what is the cost of starving a nation?3. No alt-milks. I don’t drink milk but I have some huge problems with industries that take a product that requires tonnes of water to produce, “milk” it, and then ditch the actual product at the end, creating a food waste. The boom of this category is also a huge bee killer, and no bees mean no food, means no life.4. No produce out of season. I eat like this already because it’s better for the environment, not just in terms of farming, but it also reduces my carbon footprint. It’s a no-brainer and generally cheaper because there is always a surplus of in-season produce.Thankfully meal-prepping legume-based dishes like soups, curries and salads takes no time, and any excuse to incorporate more colour and variety of vegetables into my diet is a good thing.I found myself getting out of my go-to prep or clean-out-the-fridge dishes and making foods I never would have otherwise attempted at home, like dosa (for you sandwich press chefs out there, the batter also cooks very well in a toastie machine and doesn’t stink out the office) and finding more creative ways to eat whole grains, tofu and legumes.Surprisingly, as I cut animal products out of my diet, I found that I wanted them less and less. My three days of plant-based eating slowly became four, then five, and then I found myself eating like a “regular” person only when I went out with friends or for work.From an athletic perspective, despite training intensely six days a week, my energy levels and strength did not change. As for my weekly food spend, my grocery bill was halved although if I bought packaged, processed foodsthat wouldn’t be the case.As for the negatives, there are only a few and they barely qualify as negatives. One is a personal preference: I am not a fan of tempeh. No matter how you marinate it, fry it or deep fry it, we will never be friends.The second negative is that nothing will prepare you for the wind. I’m talking about your own, your partner’s and the fact that you will be holding in a lot of gas so you aren’t ostracised from society. After a week or two of adjusting, your body gets used to all the starches fermenting in your guts, but you need to hang in there and cross that threshold.And finally, even though you haven’t told them you’ve switched to eating a mostly plant-based diet, people will have very long-winded opinions about it, and they will feel it is imperative that you listen. How very tiresome.As for the experiment, it has now become a lifestyle choice where most of my meals are vegan. There is nothing unhealthy or destructive about eating more whole-food, plant-based meals. After all, as the sociocultural writer Michael Pollan says: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” And whether it is for the sake of the planet or your own body, he is right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30ba7187029a070c4a91b0c12103f566e623b94/0_155_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c55b66b46cdcfe9527f2408987d4f49e","title":"brady i couldnt carry on working for philip green as a feminist","story":"Businesswoman resigned from the board of tycoon’s retail empire in February 2019Karren Brady, the businesswoman star of television’s The Apprentice, has said she resigned from the board of Sir Philip Green’s retail empire because the allegations being made against the high street tycoon were incompatible with being a feminist.The comments come almost a year after Lady Brady had resisted calls to sever her links with Green following claims that the businessman had sexually harassed and racially abused staff. Green has always denied any unlawful behaviour towards employees.In the wake of last year’s storm over the allegations, Brady initially said she had a “sense of duty” towards employees of Green’s holding company and that “walking away” would have been the easy thing to do.However, a fortnight later she resigned from Green’s Taveta Investments, which ultimately owns Topshop and Miss Selfridge, in February 2019.On Tuesday, when asked on Sky News’s business show Ian King Live how she squared her “feminist credentials with some of the things Sir Philip was accused of”, Brady replied: “Well, I didn’t square them because I resigned. I think that says all it needs to say.”Brady, a Tory peer in the House of Lords, is best known for the leading roles she has played at the Premier League football club West Ham United, where she is vice-chair, and as an aide to Lord Sugar on BBC One’s The Apprentice.The businesswoman first came to prominence in 1993 at the age of 23, when she was appointed as managing director of another football club, Birmingham City, and is still frequently referred to as “the first lady of football”.That prolific and high-profile business career has enabled Brady to become a champion of women in the workplace.However, at the same time as campaigning for women’s rights, she has also been closely associated with some of business’s most unreconstructed figures – including Sugar, Green, and the former pornographer David Sullivan, who owned Birmingham City before acquiring half of West Ham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d2fba20231bf205449fc1dc6bf12c48a9979bc/0_214_4044_2427/master/4044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2af1ecb65707b14bee0eca0afac65505","title":"inter tottenham christian eriksen in january transfer football","story":"Christian Eriksen has told Inter that he wants to join them in this transfer window after the Serie A club started negotiations with Tottenham to sign the Danish international, who is out of contract in six months.Inter have offered the Dane a four-year deal, which would be extended by another six months if they can persuade Tottenham to sell the player this month.

It begins with his keynote essay entitled China’s Global Threat to Human Rights.A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said on Monday that: “It is China’s sovereignty to allow one’s entry or not.”He indicated that Human Rights Watch is among organisations that support and instigate “anti-China activists ... to engage in radical violent crimes, and incite separatist activities hyping Hong Kong independence.”“These organisations deserve sanctions and must pay a price,” he said.UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, asked on Tuesday about Roth’s denial of entry to Hong Kong, said: “In principle, we support the rights and work of human rights defenders around the world.”Chinese diplomat Xing Jisheng, who attended the UN press launch, spoke at the end and said the was report “very prejudicial”, saying it has “fabrications” and telling journalists “we completely reject the content”.In the essay, Roth said the Chinese Communist Party is “worried that permitting political freedom would jeopardise its grasp on power” and “is running scared of its own people”.“The consequence under President Xi Jinping is China’s most pervasive and brutal oppression in decades,” he said.To avoid a global backlash against its surveillance, internet censorship and oppression at home, Roth said the government was trying to undermine international institutions designed to protect human rights.  Roth criticised UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, saying despite the UN’s central role in promoting human rights, he has been “unwilling to publicly demand an end to China’s mass detention of Turkic Muslims, while heaping praise on Beijing’s economic prowess”.  Roth said the report showed China wasn’t the only threat to human rights, pointing to serious violations by the warring parties in Syria and Yemen.He also cited “autocratic populists” who come to power by demonising minorities and retain it by attacking independent journalists, judges and activists who try to provide checks and balances on their rule.“Some leaders, such as US president Donald Trump, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, bridle at the same body of international human rights law that China undermines,” Roth said.

When I was 45 my husband left me quite suddenly after 25 years of what I thought was a very happy life. I was miserable but I could cope. After six days I met my current husband and apart from being unhappy I was also in love. But then I turned 47 and two or three months later I felt so miserable. Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad. I had no money, I missed my children, and my work wasn’t going well. It feels like I had to cross some sort of swamp to get to the other side. Now, at the age of 54, I am happy and have been for quite a while. Manon Sikkel, 54, writer, AmsterdamIt’s weird timing that I’m seeing your article now, at the age 47, as I do feel like I’m questioning a lot about life these days. I think a lot about the difference between how I thought life would be and the reality. I became a parent quite late and, to be honest, I do struggle with the practicalities of looking after a pre-schooler. I do love my little girl, but it can often feel like hard work at a time of life when used to think I’d feel less pressured and stressed.Work-wise, I became self-employed two years ago. Partly because of childcare issues, but also because, working in marketing, I could sense myself losing touch with the latest developments – especially on the social media side. Obviously family time is important and we all need to earn a living, but I suppose this is an age where I think I haven’t achieved what I might have wanted (although I was never totally sure what this was). Or I at least wonder what else I could be doing that might be more fulfilling. It is a funny time of life for me, and I don’t want to moan as I do appreciate there’s not actually anything wrong with my life. Hopefully things will change as my daughter becomes more self-reliant and I can enjoy time with her more. And while I must admit to feeling quite lost now, I think my 50s could be OK. Matt, BirminghamSorry to go against the findings but I would say that my 40s in general were probably the best period of my life. My life changed a lot during my 20s and 30s and I had a lot of fun as a performing musician, but having young kids and being very involved with their development was very satisfying. The relationship with my partner was good and I reached a kind of maturity whilst still retaining most of my energy and enthusiasm for life. I would definitely say I was far more satisfied with life at 47 than I was at 57. Andrew Jarman, 63, works in event production, Seville, SpainI worry a lot: about money, my kids’ happiness, my marriage, and family issues. I miss my dad who passed away I have insomnia and I’m not sure where my life is going. I feel so tired that at the end of the day I go to bed before the kids! So I don’t really do anything for me, not anything that I can sustain, anyway, because I’m either with the children, at work or too tireddon’t have enough money. I am unhappy about my home: my husband is a bit of a hoarder and we have a very small house. I hate the clutter as it stresses me out and makes me sad, but he won’t throw anything away. It upsets me. Katie, 47, SydneyI’ll be 47 in a couple of weeks. Physically I’m in good shape and quite active. However, over the past nine months or so my mental health has been very poor. I’ve had quite severe depression and anxiety attacks. I’ve tried therapy (not very helpful) and am on antidepressants, but feel like I’m really only just keeping my head above water. I haven’t been off work but cannot focus and feel like I’m just going through the motions when I’m there. I don’t socialise as much as I used to, and don’t tend to enjoy it when I do. There are a number of factors that have combined to hit me hard at this age.I have a job with lots of responsibilities and stress a parent with dementia and poor health and the various stresses and strains that go with being a husband and parent. I’m lucky enough not to have financial worries, but even so I find managing my personal finances stressful. Most of all, though, it’s that classic midlife realisation that I’ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don’t really enjoy or find meaningful or fulfilling, and that the clock is ticking if I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love and are important to me. John, LondonAt the time I felt there must be more – that the monotony of existence couldn’t go on. Then, a few weeks before my 47 birthday, my husband announced he was having an affair with his secretary. He packed his things and left. I was pretty cross about him throwing away a 25-year relationship in such a cliched fashion – but a part of me was singing with joy. This was my ‘out’. The following year wasn’t a pleasant one, and I did grieve for what I lost – but I love my new life. I have a home, children, friends, a resurrected career and no miserable old git asking how much my boots cost. I have become much happier. Naomi, OxfordshireGhastly. I was working 12 hours a day to support my family, with a house husband who hated staying at home to look after our two children but couldn’t find a well-paid job. This put a terrible strain on our marriage. I discovered later that he spent his day online in sex chat rooms. I felt unattractive, exhausted from my three-hour commute every day into London, and a bad mother. Not surprisingly, at 49 things came to a head. I ended up having an affair and we orced when I was 51.I put on weight through excessive drinking and a lack of exercise. I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping. In bed at night I had the sensation of ants crawling over my legs. There were some very dark times when I had massive rows with my husband and walked out of the house, only returning after five or six hours. I have now been in a loving and secure relationship for nine years. Gemma, DorsetI’m generally happier than I’ve ever been. No one told me middle age was so enjoyable. I know who I am and still have enough energy to enjoy life. I have sod all to prove to anyone at this age so I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies and activities without fear of what people might think. It’s great. Only down side is my job which is down to a lack of skilled positions in my area - but the pay is ok and it keeps me out of trouble. David, CarlisleAt the age of 46.5 I feel quite drained by the daily routine which involves managing a household, two kids and a full-time job. I have come to realise that over the last year or so, every holiday I take is followed by an utmost struggle to fit back into the usual pattern and this has induced me to reflect on the quality of life I live and my expectations. I am obviously a little unsatisfied with how I live even though I have a safe job, I am not overworked, and I have two lovely kids who are great fun and who have happy lives.

This is the most substantial investigation I think there has been of the case and I think will raise real questions about it.”The Lubbock documentary, Unexplained, has been made with the cooperation of his family and broadcasts for the first time the 999 call made after his death in Barrymore’s swimming pool in Essex.Katz said: “It’s extraordinary that 19 years after Stuart Lubbock was found everyone knows that something terrible happened there and no one’s been held accountable … I think this show moves some way towards answering that gap.”Terry Lubbock, Stuart’s father, said: “The story has become so distorted and confused over the years. So much has been said and written. It’s time to put all the facts together in one place.”Also this year Channel 4 will follow up its 100 Vaginas series with a “provocative look at 21st-century masculinity” in a candidly titled programme called Penises, and it will examine women’s changing attitudes to pubic hair in Bring Back the Bush.Other provocative shows include the Segregation Experiment – a programme that follows a school’s tests for unconscious bias in children in ways that include segregating them, and a satirical look at Prince Harry and Meghan’s plan to step down as senior royals in the return of the comedy The Windsors.Additional highlights include Write Offs – a series about illiteracy hosted by Sandi Toksvig culminating in a spelling bee – Channel 4’s move into natural history with Living Wild and comedies including Amy Poehler’s co-creation Duncanville and the comedy series Maxxx on new youth channel E4.Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, said it was important to focus on attracting more younger viewers because “their behaviours are changing faster than older viewers, they go more to streaming”, but said “we still want to be broad” and appeal to older audiences.Katz said the broadcaster’s new regional bases were helping to change its makeup, with some ideas not being commissioned because the new regional commissioners were telling him that “no one outside London is interested in that”. He said the less metropolitan feel would become more apparent when the BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern begins her new daily current affairs show in the spring.The Channel 4 bosses appeared confident that the broadcaster can continue to challenge convention despite clashing with the government last year over its decision to fill Boris Johnson’s empty place in its climate change debate with an ice sculpture and after Johnson was called a “known liar” by Channel 4’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne.Mahon noted that the government’s threat to its remit made during the general election had been withdrawn and said: “Elections are a heated time. On the climate change debate, Ofcom gave us a very clean bill of health on impartiality.”Meanwhile, Katz said after the success of Brexit: The Uncivil War, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings, “we are working on a number of projects with James Graham who wrote that show”, but whether Cummings will be in them or not “is another question”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c5ced8a0b2b5fdc002ce37ff44470f7127c9b9/0_557_8360_5016/master/8360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5713ed9ddea5cb90ac32e2955a4743","title":"netflix accused of funnelling uk profits through netherlands","story":"TV streaming giant pushed up to £330m in profits through low-tax state despite generous UK reliefs and rebatesNetflix has been accused of funnelling as much as £330m in profits made from operations outside the US into tax havens, while receiving generous relief for making shows such as The Crown in the UK, which helped cut its bill.The Taxwatch thinktank has estimated that in 2018 Netflix moved between $327m and $430m (£250m-£330m) in profits from international operations outside the US, including the UK, to low-tax jurisdictions such as the Netherlands.Despite having more than 10 million subscribers paying more than £860m in subscription fees each year in the UK, Netflix UK received a €57,000 (£51,000) rebate from the government in 2018. The company’s UK financial filing stated revenues of just €48m, and pre-tax profits of €2.3m, because the hundreds of millions of pounds from British subscribers are channelled via its European headquarters in the Netherlands.At the same time Netflix, which has a market value of $150bn, claimed £924,000 in tax relief as part of government incentives to make sure Britain remains a competitive location for making productions, according to the report. High-quality TV shows made in the UK that cost more than £1m per episode to make, such as The Crown, and films that pass a “cultural test” are eligible for relief. Netflix, which has more than 200 staff in the UK, spent $500m making more than 50 TV shows and films in the UK last year.“This research shows that Netflix is ripping off our public services by channelling profits through tax havens even though it appears to have employees, property, and a substantial customer base in the UK,” said John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor.“What’s even worse is that Netflix is claiming tax reliefs in the UK at the same time as it’s channelling profits overseas.”McDonnell said the report shows the government needs to go further than implementing its proposed “digital services tax”, which the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts will make just £30m each from the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Netflix.“The government should ... support Labour’s proposal for unitary taxation of multinationals, which would require Netflix and other large multinationals to pay their fair share of tax,” he said.A Netflix spokesman said: “Netflix has always paid the taxes required in the countries where we operate.”Amazon, which is being pursued by the European commission for more than €250m over “illegal tax advantages” in Luxembourg, paid just €55m in tax on European revenues of €24.9bn in 2017. In 2016, it paid €16.5m on revenues of €21.6bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31c88459d05e38658a28fa0bdf4bc2abf608e890/0_0_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=620024e15efd7ca6dc1676f3730da1b7","title":"orf you go what the papers say about prince harrys meeting with the queen","story":"Queen’s statement described as ‘historic’ and compared to her TV appearance after Princess Diana died The Queen’s decision to “reluctantly” let the Duke and Duchess of Sussex step down as senior royals generates plenty of light and heat across the front pages.Harry and Meghan “got their way” at the Sandringham royal summit, according to the Sun, but the papers says the queen made it plain she is “deeply upset they are quitting”.“Orf you go … but one is not amused,” is its headline.

This arch-romantic programme of Chopin and Franck found them on electric form, single-minded in their approach to music even while it highlighted their different strengths.The warmth and intensity of Capuçon’s cello was thrown into relief by both the crisp agility of Wang’s piano playing and her sometimes surprising switches into understated quietness. Franck’s Sonata in A Major had a singing quality that carried it from its lilting beginnings to the soaring finale. Arranged for cello with the composer’s blessing, it was originally written for the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe, who gave the premiere at his own wedding – something to think about next time the speeches go on too long – and it wasn’t a stretch to hear joyous church bells in the finale’s pealing scales.Chopin’s Introduction et Polonaise Brillante initially found Wang taking an accompanying role, but ended with a dazzling display from her – of course Chopin couldn’t keep the piano in the background for long. Nothing seemed to faze Wang, either here or in Chopin’s later Cello Sonata, where only a tendency to lose melodic clarity at the moments of greatest frenzy betrayed any sense of difficulty. Capuçon shaped long phrases as if he were a singer whose breath never needed topping up. The high point came with the slow movement, standing out from the dark drama around it in its almost innocent simplicity.If the performance seemed well-oiled and absolutely secure, that wasn’t surprising: Wang and Capuçon toured and recorded this programme, and released the disc last month. This, then, was the concert of the CD – right down to the encore, Piazzolla’s Le Grand Tango, which was a bit of a stylistic jolt but was fun and forceful right through to Wang’s closing double-handed glissando up the length of the keyboard. There was great virtuosity in this concert, and great musicianship a little more risk-taking was all that was missing.• Yuja Wang is at the Barbican, London, on 31 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c201b0692741cc6f338a13fb40cb2ba87480ca8c/555_0_6805_4084/master/6805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c98be2b0d7fbf26c54961f582ec5e8","title":"kudos leaderboards qoms how fitness app strava became a religion","story":"The Strava app offers community, training data and motivation to millions of athletes. Even runners who dislike tech can’t bear to be without it. By  Rose GeorgeOn Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: “Right then, off you go.” Fell running – making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain – thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don’t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.Yet, at the start of the race, two things happened: 400 feet started to move, and 200 fingers pressed a button on a wristwatch equipped with GPS, setting the devices to record. The moor birds’ cheeps were now accompanied by beeps. When it comes to tracking and measuring runs, and being obsessed with data, we are right up there with the rest of the field. But tracking and measuring were just the start. Soon after finishing the race, most of the runners would upload that GPS data to a digital platform that has changed the world of amateur sport. The fell runners knew, as millions of people worldwide do, that if it isn’t on Strava, it didn’t happen.Strava is a fitness and sports tracking platform that launched in 2009 and bills itself the “number one app for runners and cyclists”. As long as you have a smartphone, watch or bike computer that records your activities using GPS, you can sync it with Strava, then upload your run, cycle, ski or almost any other activity, and be rewarded with astonishing levels of data analysis. For an amateur, the data available from Strava is like having a Team GB coach in your phone, for free.Strava tells me how fast I ran in May 2015 or last Thursday, and how much improvement I have made. Every run I do is recognised and automatically matched to anyone else who has run the same route, or part of it. Athletes – as Strava flatteringly calls its users – can create a “segment”, a portion of a route, perhaps featuring a hill or a stretch of lake, against which other athletes can then match their own efforts. In my local park, I can see how my 2017 self did on a segment someone has named Up the Bloody Hill, or on Stairway to Heaven (actually steps to the car park), or on #Weeeeeeeeeee! My efforts can be scored on “leaderboards” so that I can compare myself with myself, with my Strava followers and friends, or with strangers from Korea to Kansas.Because of Strava, I know how many miles my shoes have covered and whether I need new ones, as the app will email me to tell me (without sending me ads for shoes). After a race, I can launch Strava’s Flyby feature, an ingenious interactive map, and watch my digital self rerun the race route alongside anyone else who ran it. It is addictive, to watch these ghosts in the machine, and see where they got away, or where I caught them up, to see if they went wrong and how badly. For my efforts, I can be given “kudos” by anyone who follows me – the Strava “like”, signified by a thumbs up – and I can do the same for them. I can leave supportive comments and add photos. I can change the name of my activity from the default “morning run” or “lunch ride” to something witty and punning, and it is one of the unwritten rules of Strava that I should.Because of Strava, I also have a ringside seat into how elite athletes train and race: more than half of the Tour de France peloton last year uploaded their stages. I can follow the training of Kílian Jornet, the world’s best mountain runner, or champion distance runner Aly Dixon. Strava has been downloaded by 49 million people in 195 countries, and the company claims it attracts a million new users a month. In total, these people upload 25 activities a second, or 15.3m a week. They share 4 million photos a week and last year gave each other 3.6bn kudos. In the reward loop of Strava, activities get kudos, which encourages more activities. Adding funny names, emojis or photos increases the number of kudos by up to a third. More kudos, more exercise. The more people share their data, the better the experience.The essential goal of any tech platform is to make you use it again. This is called “stickiness”. But one step beyond stickiness is community: the key is to embed a tech platform into someone’s life, including their friends and wider circle of acquaintances and fellow athletes they haven’t even met. Group encouragement is proven to have a positive effect on fitness: users who belong to a club (including virtual ones) upload three times more activities than non-members.Ben Mounsey is a top mountain runner from Yorkshire, and formerly a school photography teacher in Elland, near Halifax. Before he discovered Strava, he was a good enough runner to make national teams. “But I didn’t have any focus. I was just running on natural fumes,” he says. He never kept a diary and could not remember his run times. In 2014, a friend mentioned Strava. He signed up, got a GPS watch and started recording his times. “I became obsessed, from day one,” he says.I don’t consider myself addicted to Strava: I don’t check in unless I’ve done an activity. I don’t get notifications. I have never created a segment and don’t know how to. I would never log into Strava just to browse. And yet, looking at the data has become an essential part of my exercise regime. Once, my phone broke when I was travelling without a computer to hand, and my first action when I got a new one was to manually upload to Strava the runs I had done without it. My data shows I have done 171 runs in the past 12 months: my memory has recorded that I did fewer than half a dozen that weren’t logged. What I don’t know is how a middling, menopausal fell runner, who only began running at the age of 41, and will never win much, got to care so much about any of this.In the mid-90s, two former college friends, Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey, met to discuss an idea. They had been competitive rowers at Harvard, and both missed rowing life: its competition and camaraderie were hard to recreate when they no longer had time for team sports. Gainey and Horvath’s idea was to create a “virtual locker room” where people who exercised alone could still find a community. But the technology wasn’t good enough to build what they wanted. Instead, they founded Kana, a company selling email and marketing software which, at its height, was valued at $10bn (£7.7bn).In 2006, they came up with the idea for a social network for athletes, with “athlete” meaning anyone who took fitness seriously. (Strava’s CEO until November last year, James Quarles, defines an athlete as “anyone who sweats”.) They chose the name Strava, from the Swedish “to strive”. By then, technology had progressed enough for people to carry GPS devices in their pockets, and strap on lightweight heart monitors.Gainey and Horvath had observed that digital sharing was rising at the same time as communal activity was declining. They targeted what they called “avids” – cyclists who rode frequently – and hoped that word would spread. From the beginning, the big hook was the leaderboard, a ranking of anyone who has cycled a particular route. This was not unique, but was borrowed from online gaming. The difference was that this scoreboard was linked to real-world physical activity. Strava offered the competitive draw of segments and the gratification of kudos. There were also rewards: as the quickest rider of any segment, you would be labelled King of the Mountain (KOM) or Queen of the Mountain (QOM). That these prizes are fleeting, lasting only as long as it takes for someone to beat your time, only increased the addictiveness.These features – lures, rewards, competition – are now considered standard in gamification, which apps use to get us to return. Strava’s ace was to combine the competitive appeal of the segment with a community of likeminded people who knew how much it meant to come back from injury or miss a personal best. Add an interface that is widely accepted to be clever, clean and extremely simple to use – along with the increasingly rare situation of being free from ads – and Strava was a hit.The first Strava user was David Belden, a cyclist from California. (He is still on Strava and, in 2019, he covered 1,455.8 miles and climbed almost 40,000 metres.) For the first years, the main users of Strava looked similar to Belden, in that most of them were male and on a bike. Growth was steady. In 2011, Strava offered a separate running app, before merging everything in 2014. Strava staff like to call their product “agnostic” because it doesn’t care what device or app is used to upload data. “We are the Switzerland of tracking platforms,” says Gareth Nettleton, vice-president of marketing at Strava’s UK base in Bristol.Strava is not the most-used fitness app in the world. Runkeeper has 50 million users Runtastic claims more than 147 million registered users and is popular in Europe. Other strong competitors are MapMyRun, Endomondo, Nike+ and Google Fit. Most offer some variety of tracking, recording and sociability. Many are owned by big sports shoe and clothing corporations (Asics, bought Runkeeper in 2016 for $83m Under Armor bought MapMyRun and its 20 million users for $150m).Strava does not sell clothes or shoes. Quarles, former CEO, came from Instagram, where he had introduced ads, but there are no plans to do the same at Strava. More important is building goodwill in the community. “I worked for a long time at the intersection of technology and communities,” he told me on the phone from the US last spring, “and at how technology brings people closer together, not turns into this dystopian thing of them spending time apart.”Strava users may start as loners, only tracking their own activities, but the hope is that they will soon be hooked into tracking friends and peers, and that this will push them to go further and faster. But the friendly competition of a supportive, likeminded community can sometimes lead to darker impulses.Mounsey, the mountain runner, found the segment a powerful addiction. For months, he “went crazy” trying to win every segment within a 10-mile radius. “Everyone hated me for a long time in Elland.” Once, he says, a clubmate took a segment off him on a local steep hill called Trooper Lane. “I couldn’t believe it. I tried not to be bothered by it, I saw it at 7.30pm and by 8pm I was analysing it.” The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than normal, ate nothing, stopped off at Trooper Lane, did a hard session of 35 minutes, beat his clubmate by five minutes, then went to work and fell asleep in the classroom. “I felt really ill, I’d pushed myself so hard, all for a bloody segment, for male pride,” he says. Then adds: “I’m portraying myself as a bit of a psychopath here, aren’t I?”When he found himself running miles on a Sunday just because he hadn’t reached his self-imposed weekly target, he pulled back. “I can see the good and bad in Strava.” (He’s still on it, though. Disclaimer: he is an unpaid Strava ambassador.)Strava says segments don’t just appeal to men, although I have never seen a female runner suddenly set off at speed shouting “segment!” as a male clubmate once did. This pursuit of a record can encourage dangerous impulses. In 2010, a cyclist named William “Kim” Flint was killed chasing a fast downhill segment when his bike, travelling at 40mph, crashed into a car in Oakland, California. (His family sued Strava and lost.) Forbes magazine called this “a quantified-self fatality”. Mountain bikers frequently report being pushed off trails by other bikers descending at speed and yelling “STRAVA!”. In 2016, alarmed by the speeds recorded on Strava segments, a council in Los Altos, California, banned mountain bikers from Byrne Preserve. Strava now lets users flag a segment as hazardous, and its terms of service absolve the company of any responsibility for “known or unknown risks associated with these activities even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Strava”.Once, I got a CR – course record, the equivalent of Queen of the Mountain – on a random stretch of trail in south-west France. This is a rare enough event that I remember it vividly. Within hours, a Strava email alerted me that I had lost the record I immediately logged in to see who had taken it. Then I checked how fast she had run it and compared her time to mine. Then I went to her profile and checked how old she was and all her other activities. A year later, I am still planning to go back to that unremarkable forest track up the hill from Belesta and sprint up a random 400 metres as fast as I possibly can.Strava forums have plenty of fuming users enraged about cheating. E-bike users who “forget” to mark their rides as an e-bike and end up on leaderboard are a growing problem. Taking your GPS watch for a drive is another. In Hong Kong, one user wrote on Strava’s forum: “A large percentage of segments is polluted by people using cars or electric scooters.”Some of this is accidental, as e-bike users have to manually change a setting on Strava to mark their rides as assisted. Some of it is not. An e-biker named Matt May has a profile picture of a bottle of vodka attached to his bike, and delights in annoying Strava purists. There are legitimate third-party apps that claim to help people improve their Strava stats by alerting them, for example, to wind conditions. Then there was the short-lived website Digital EPO (named after erythropoietin, a common illegal drug in sport) that allowed people to alter the GPS data to show they had gone faster than they had in reality. This inflamed plenty of cycling and running forums.On his podcast, the California-based ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll hints at why what people post on Strava matters: “There’s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn, I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience – the highs and the lows – makes all of us better.”I did once report a cheat. Strava lets you do this by “flagging” a suspect activity, such as a ride or run that has clearly been done in a car, or on an e-bike. Why did I care? It was a woman who had apparently run a stretch of my local park in about 10 seconds. I cared because I had just run that same stretch and it had taken more than two minutes. I cared because it was physically impossible to do what her upload said. I am never going to be an elite athlete. I am competitive, but only with myself, and only because I want to disprove the idea that a 50-year-old woman cannot improve. Yet, suddenly, when I saw that improbable segment, I was seven years old again and someone had cheated in the playground. My emotions had the purity of childish rage, that white heat of unfairness. I flagged the segment, which meant she would have been given an option to delete it, which she did. I’m not sure if I felt bigger or smaller for doing it. (I’m lying. I would do it again.)Brazilians are social, and they also love sport, making Brazil a perfect society for Strava (they also like to work out with their family, unlike any other country). The French are equally into running and cycling Germans prefer bikes. Strava’s yearly data report offers other revelations. The most active day of 2018 for German cyclists was 6 May for French cyclists it was 9 September. Americans ran more on 23 November than on any other day in 2018 Japanese runners were busiest on 16 September. Globally, most people exercise on a Sunday except in the UK and Ireland, where we prefer Tuesday. Runners talk about beer in their activity uploads cyclists talk more about coffee. From Strava data, the media concluded that the second week in January is “quitters’ week”, when newly active users give up (although women will last two days longer than men).This data also offers a “heat map” – a record of activities in any given area. In 2018 Strava’s global heat map, a record of 1bn activities worldwide, accidentally revealed the location of secret US military bases, because personnel had uploaded their activities to Strava and failed to opt out of heat maps. Fitness tracking data can have other uses: one user concluded her boyfriend was cheating by noticing how often his Strava rides were done in the company of another woman. Fitbit and Apple Watch data has been used to solve murders (in one case, showing that the victim’s heart rate had spiked during the suspect’s visit and been silent thereafter). Those that opt in to Strava heat maps become a saleable product. Under a project called , Strava sells anonymised data to cities about where and when its users ride and run and exercise. More than 70 cities have used  in the US states of Colorado, New Hampshire, and in the UK as have academic and non-profit organisations such as Glasgow University’s Urban Big Data Centre. Strava offers a paid subscription called Summit with additional features – more heart data, the ability to filter leaderboards by age and weight, and a useful location-tracking feature called Beacon – for about £4.50 a month. The company doesn’t release figures about how many of its athletes pay for Summit, but it is thought to be a percentage in single figures.Athletes who use products from companies with whom Strava has set up commercial partnerships now find their activities attached to a banner proclaiming that they “ran with Suunto” or cycled with Zwift. For the first time this year, Strava’s Year in Sport report included a section on “the world’s hottest gear”, a list of the most popular brands used by people on the platform. It is not an ad, but it smells like one. “Wahoo doesn’t sponsor me,” said one user in Strava’s forum, among many objectors. “There is no reason I should be forced to sponsor them.”When we spoke in early 2019, Quarles was optimistic that profitability wasn’t far off, but he was suddenly replaced in November 2019 by co-founder Mark Gainey, with Michael Horvath also returning to an active role. Strava also lost its high-profile chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, who had been digital chief for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, after only a year. There are a few options for Strava to make money: becoming a subscription-only service, selling up, selling its users to advertisers, or selling more data than it does currently ( data is anonymised, and Strava’s terms of service say that users own their data, but that they grant Strava a huge licence to use it).Perhaps the golden years of this clever, uncommercial app being available for free are numbered. But Strava is still a beacon of positivity among the bile and manipulation of other social media. Trolling is rare and usually only takes the form of excessive kudos from randoms – and what’s wrong with that? I get regular abuse on Twitter on Strava, I have never had anything but encouragement. The company says its currency is effort, but it is also largely goodwill. The platform’s privacy controls now are good enough that I can hide my home and my place of work, and I can stay off leaderboards. I could stay off Strava, too, but I don’t intend to. It is a guidebook and a corkboard (posting photos, Strava believes, enables powerful “memorialisation” of activities). It is training log, chat room and map room. And in these days of public carping and rage, it is something I prize more than race prizes: it is a refuge.Richard Askwith, a British writer and fell runner, is the author of Running Free, a book about the over-commercialisation and datafication of running. He gave up running with a smartwatch years ago. “I think if I was constantly wanting to tell other people about my runs I would be losing out on the experience of the run itself. If you’re running off-road, then you’re inhabiting your environment and you’re sensing how your step feels and you’re thinking about where your next step is going to go. Then if you want to think about how much effort you’re putting in, you just sort put your foot on the pedal a bit, but it’s all subjectively measured.”Or, as one cyclist who had given up quantifying wrote: “I remember when cycling used to be fun.”The British Medical Journal provides a service assessing some fitness apps. Its entry on Strava lists the obvious pros (it’s free, it’s easy to set up, it encourages users to push harder than they would alone). The writer also warned of the cons: “Owing to the competitive nature installed in users of the app, risk-taking behaviours may be increased that could lead to musculoskeletal injury or road traffic collisions.” Also, “one may forget what a leisurely bike ride or jog used to feel like.” A paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society in London in 2013 by Dr Paul Barratt of Staffordshire University suggested that Strava was, perversely, making group rides antisocial, as riders concentrated on winning segments from virtual strangers rather than focusing on their fellow riders in real life.Fell runner Tim Dempsey gave up using technology on the hills three years ago. “Thinking forward to the completed run on-screen while running, only to finish and use the screen to look back. It removes you utterly from the moment. Two years on. I still look at my naked wrist for cues.”“I love it and hate it in equal measure,” says the runner and coach Anji Andrews. “It’s great for logging training and keeping track of pace, routes, mileage. It’s horrific in being, to many, just an online log of excuses and encouraging comparison (the thief of joy).”Recently, on occasion, I have forgotten to wear my GPS watch at races and runs. At races, I experienced mild concern: if it is not recorded, then how will I know how fast I have run? How will my miles count towards my yearly 1,000-mile target? But then I set off, on a recreational or competitive run, and something happens. I feel freer. I run across moorland and stop to look around, and don’t worry about pausing my watch, about someone later looking at my data and seeing that I stopped for a gawp of the purple heather and the eerie calm of the stone circle. I walk for a bit and revel in not being recorded. No one is looking. No one cares.At the biggest race in my calendar, the Yorkshire Three Peaks, I didn’t dare leave my watch behind. I had certain cut-offs – set times – to reach, so I needed to know what the time was. But as I set off up Pen-y-Ghent, I did something strange, and turned my watch to the inside of my wrist. That made it slightly harder to check, and so I hardly checked it. I ran according to feel, as the training term goes, and despite hailstorms and cramp and only looking at my watch three times over 23 miles, I got the best time I had ever done.Maybe I had learned to pace myself so well by using tech that I could do it without? I was a fell running equivalent of Luke Skywalker in his X-wing fighter, switching off the targeting system and feeling the Force. Unchained from data, I felt free and powerful. And within a couple of hours of finishing, after sitting among my real life running friends in the race marquee, all of us glowing with achievement, and scoffing stew in likeminded company, I uploaded the run to Strava. How else would I get any kudos?• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

Almost as if the producers didn’t quite trust the prime minister not to back out of his first televised interview since the election and wanted to shame him into going through with it. Or at the very least to have footage of him sneaking out a rear window.But for once Boris Johnson was as good as his word and shortly after 8am the BBC’s Dan Walker found himself face to face with a figure who looked as if he had just tumbled out of bed.Let’s start with Iran, said Walker. Boris clasped his knees tightly, trying desperately to remember exactly where Iran was and why it was important. It was quite early in the morning. Then it came to him. “I don’t want a military conflict,” he said hesitantly. A decent enough start, given the circumstances – it will have come as a huge relief to a lot of people who might have been expecting him to declare war.Gradually Johnson’s brain began to engage with itself. If not always with reality. He had been out of the country when the US had launched its drone strike on Qassem Suleimani, he said. On holiday, Walker reminded him. Yes, and Trump had sent him a Whatsapp message telling him to watch repeats of the attack on Fox News, but he hadn’t picked it up till much later as the wifi at the private bar on the beach was a bit iffy.And no, he hadn’t for a minute thought of showing some leadership and coming home. How many more times in his life was he going to be offered a £20K-a-week villa on Mustique for absolutely nothing?Sensing the interview was taking a turn for the worse, Boris reverted to his default position under pressure of making up policy as he went along. What really needed to happen next was for the US to come up with its own nuclear deal and then Iran, the UK and the other signatories could just tear up up the old Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The same JCPOA that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had spent 45 minutes defending in the Commons the previous day.Walker kindly changed the subject before Boris could do any more damage.“You’ve never dodged tricky issues in the past,” Walker now observed. Even Boris appeared shocked by this. He had spent a whole lifetime dodging the difficult questions. Especially when they are being asked by Andrew Neil or the Today programme. Or his close family.But this time it turned out that the tricky question concerned Harry and Meghan’s future. Boris visibly relaxed. He clearly doesn’t care one way or the other and is merely relieved that the royals are giving him a bit of respite from the media spotlight. I’m sure they will work something out, he mumbled.Walker then moved on to Brexit. “Your favourite subject,” he added. Now a rare moment of honesty escaped the prime minister’s lips. “Actually, it’s my least favourite subject,” he replied. Because every mention of it is a reminder of just how many lies he has told and of the reckoning he fears is to come.But just as quickly, he retreated for cover – his tragedy is that he both longs to be seen yet knows he cannot survive the exposure – and went into full pifflepafflewifflewaffle. He was epically confident of getting a full trade deal. Very, very, very, confident. As in not confident at all. He was winging it again. With Johnson the probability of something happening is in inverse proportion to the hyperbole.“Bung a bob for Big Ben bongs,” Boris bumbled. Alliteration cuts both ways. It would cost £500K to ring Big Ben on 31 January, but if there were enough people out there who were willing to stump up for the pleasure then he wouldn’t rule it out. After all, he had wasted £40m on a garden bridge that was never going to be built so he was no one to tell people how to spend their dosh. Besides, it was as close to a Brexit idend as anyone was likely to get.Boris did his best to talk over and distract Walker throughout the rest of the interview by talking nonsense – anything to run the clock down. But there was no disguising the fact we were watching a prime minister close to free fall in his free association. There’s a reason therapists often like to see their patients early in the morning. It’s because then they are less well defended and shrinks get to see the real person. The timing of the interview was turning out to be the biggest masterstroke of all.“In the past few days we’ve done a couple more things that we’ve done,” was the closest to coherence Boris could manage. When asked what he planned to do in the next year for former Labour voters from the Midlands and the north he couldn’t really come up with anything but repeat previously discredited lies about building 40 new hospitals this year, next year, sometime, never.He even forgot that he was already supposed to have a plan for social care provision in place and instead announced a proposal to come up with a plan at some point in the future. His only real commitment was to end the county (drugs) lines. Though he clearly hadn’t a clue how. It was like watching a panicky child think out loud.By now Walker was looking increasingly disturbed. He wrapped things up with a gentle lob about veganuary. This was the breaking of Boris. The floodgates opened. He needed to lose weight, he sobbed. But he couldn’t do without cheese. Life without cheese was a crime against humanity. Nor did he have the concentration to go vegan. Or the self-discipline. After all, it wasn’t as if these were qualities a country might reasonably expect of its prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him. I was supported by Birmingham and Solihull Women’s Aid, who found me emergency temporary accommodation in a refuge.One bank saw me three times and gave me false hope, each time saying that they would accept. Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address. An appointment was made and I attended a branch of HSBC UK far away from the shelter with staff support. They were patient and really kind to the kids and me. During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account. I could make my own decisions, and buy the kids the things they needed, without having to beg or fear his anger.HSBC UK is working with local housing and homelessness charities to provide bank accounts to people without a fixed address, helping to break the cycle of financial exclusion.

This was a specimen of Rafflesia tuan-mudae and beat the previous largest flower record of 107cm for Rafflesia arnoldii, also in Sumatra.Rafflesia is not only a giant flower, but it has no leaves, stems or proper roots. It cannot photosynthesise and instead sucks the food and water out of a particular vine using long thin filaments that look like fungal cells. It gorges itself on the vine for a few years before bursting out into a flower bud, swells for several months before blooming into a flower that looks like a bright red bucket with big thick lobes. It gives off a whiff of rotting meat that, together with its gigantic size, helps attract pollinating flies. Rafflesia also steals some of the DNA from the vine it lives on, using it for its own genetic code for reasons that are not clear.But this giant flower is critically endangered as its forests disappear, and it remains impossible to cultivate.

I’ve been playing it since I was a little kid and it’s my favorite thing in the world to do. The memories I have from this place and this organization and playing on the field with these guys will never go away.”Kuechly did not give a specific reason for his decision in the video, but indicated that injuries meant he was no longer able to play to the best of his abilities. Kuechly suffered two serious concussions during his career, the second of which forced him to miss the final six games of the 2016 campaign. He also sat out a week the following season after apparently being concussed during a game with the Philadelphia Eagles. In total, he missed 10 games due to concussions, although he did not mention brain injuries or head trauma during his retirement video.Several of his current and former teammates paid tribute to Kuechly on Tuesday night. “I couldn’t be more proud to call you my brother! Congrats on a heck of a career! The game will miss you as much as you miss the game bro! I love you my brother!” wrote Thomas Davis, who played alongside Kuechly at linebacker for several seasons.Panthers tight end Greg Olsen spoke highly of Kuechly’s character. “Words can’t describe who Luke Kuechly is as a person, friend and teammate.

England were 1-0 down heading to Hamilton. Team selection was in a state of flux. Curran himself was caught in the usual hotfoot circuit from training to team meeting to fevered personal prep.This wasn’t the problem, though. Curran wanted to get his short smartphone message for the U13s exactly right to work – in typical Curran fashion – the margins of his short U13s video message. Rehearsal was required, firmer instructions. At the end of which Curran’s message to the U13s was, it should be said, an extremely good short video message.“I hope I might end up playing with some of you one day,” he said at the end, a moment of slight double-take for the pre-teens present, unaware perhaps that Curran himself was still playing under-17 trophy matches just four years ago, usually batting in the middle-order alongside a fellow called Ollie Pope.It is a measure of how connected Curran remains to his roots at a club that really did become a surrogate family and, indeed, how strikingly young he still is, a youthfulness that can disguise the fact his career to date is a triumph of will over physical reality.Here we have a 5ft 9in skiddy medium-fast bowler, slight of stature and slight of red-ball experience, who has at no stage looked as though he doesn’t understand Test cricket perfectly, rolling in with demonic intent, the wiliest 21-year-old veteran in town.Fast forward to this week and England’s Test winter has taken a slight upturn. As have Curran’s own acquisitive England returns. Port Elizabeth will be his sixth consecutive England Test. In the previous five Curran has taken 20 wickets at 25, and often changed the tempo or the tone of an innings in the process.Not that you’d notice particularly, given the headline selection-clamour this week, the more thrilling, adrenal question of which 90mph new ball bowler is about to return and take the new ball in the wake of Jimmy Anderson’s injury.Usefully poised, working the percentages: it is a fitting place for this most disruptive, genre-hopping of junior cricketers, a Test player who still seems to be in a process of realignment, of self-definition.Understanding Sam Curran. It is a process that appears to have some way left to run, at least for those who seek only the classic tropes, the five-fors and tons of the canonical Test all-rounder.The problem is, perhaps, a tendency to start by stating what Curran is not, a list of absences that seems to rule out pretty much every role in the “nuclear” Test template. Curran is not a genuine all-rounder. He’s not a frontline batsman. He’s not a frontline bowler. He’s not a wicketkeeper. He’s not, come to think of it, a particularly good fielder.Here we have a cricketer of not-quites, a collage carved from off-cuts. And yet Curran has an undeniable solidity, and a sense of tangible influence exerted. In a time of retrenchment England have won 10 and lost four of the 15 Tests the not-quite all-rounder has played, as opposed to three wins and three losses in seven without him. Still though. It’s not just that, is it?England have learned a bit more about Curran of late. He needs the new ball to see the best of his bowling. He can bowl intense, nibbly spells when it gets older. He gets top-order batsmen out. At the same time his batting has fallen away. As Duncan Fletcher noted in a recent interview, he seems impatient, always counterattacking.But it’s not that either. It may be comforting to flag up progress towards a more traditional metric, the idea new-ball five-fors might be just around the corner for a player who wasn’t much of a bowler coming up, who Surrey have always seen as more of a batsman.In reality Curran is something else, something new. He is perhaps best seen as an episodic player. Test cricket has changed in recent times, becoming not just shorter but more varied in its rhythms: a game of surges and counter surges, of intense, decisive passages.This is what Curran has been good at. Not bowling or batting all day, taking the entire contest one way with some slow burn Herculean act, but winning those moments. He still has no five-for, no hundred, the traditional pounds and shillings of Test match achievement. But he has a bowling average under 30 and batting average close to it, and has still had a say in the winning of matches.Look around and Test match all-rounders of the old school are all but extinct in any case. According to the ICC rankings the best Test all-rounders now are Jason Holder, Ravi Jadeja, Ben Stokes, Vernon Philander, Ravichandran Ashwin and Mitchell Starc. Curran is down at 13, just ahead of Kemar Roach. Of these players only Stokes qualifies as a “classic” Beefy-Imran-Kapil kind of all-rounder, and even Stokes is a player of moments, an episode player whose worth falls outside his headline stats.But then, to be an all-rounder now is to play across formats as much as different skill sets. A cricketer like Curran must find enough surplus brilliance, not to mention enough practice time to master six different ways of batting and bowling.The only sensible response is to become effective, polyvalent, adaptable. Curran will get back to doing this in Port Elizabeth, and with an eye on adding some runs for the first time this winter. If England are to build on the triumphs of Cape Town he will, you suspect, be standing close to the centre of things involved as ever in winning those moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d16bb6472147727d0698cf6b33ac678fbbb594b3/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a79638dd83f3ef3e73fba7ba749b54","title":"this is our family review ordinary lives make for extraordinary tv","story":"Documented over three years, Tony and Emma’s story takes in everything from the death of a child to family feuds. It’s just one tale in this exceptional Boyhood-style time capsule seriesThe idea, I gather, was inspired by the film Boyhood: to make a factual strand that compressed the passing of years to produce a slice of life that wasn’t sliced too thinly. This Is Our Family (Sky Atlantic) gave film-makers three years to follow their subjects, and develop the kind of relationships necessary to document something personal and in-depth.The first of four films, made by Clare Richards, focuses on the Borg family of Newport, Wales, specifically Tony and Emma, who are not married but have just got engaged. They seem very happy together, but, before they met, Tony, a boxing coach, was defined by his reputation as a “ladies’ man”, which is one way of saying he has eight children by an unspecified number of mums. Was Emma fully apprised of his past when they met? “Hundred per cent,” she says.Tony, a gentle but deeply undemonstrative man, is facing up to the fact that some of his children are refusing to attend the wedding, for reasons he can’t, or won’t, fully explain. “The five that aren’t coming are from the same mum,” he says. “It’s quite possible they’ve decided that me getting married to someone other than their mum, perhaps they’re not happy with that.” Maybe a fuller explanation is unnecessary. It seems his children find his newly settled status just as upsetting as his wayward past. “They don’t like this changed man,” says his non-estranged daughter Sherridan.Emma, who has children of her own, can’t make up her mind about bridesmaids. “I’m either gonna have none or I’ll be having six,” she says, laughing, then blinking back tears. At this point, it becomes clear that the focus of the film isn’t Tony, but Emma, and the subject isn’t marriage at all. It is bereavement.Eighteen months before the cameras joined the Borgs in 2016, Emma’s 19-year-old daughter, Xana, was killed in a car crash on her way home from a party. Emma had driven past the scene of the accident on her way to work that morning, not knowing that Xana was involved. Her grief is still so raw that Emma doesn’t think she can bear to have bridesmaids without Xana being among them.Three and a half years later, she still can’t bring herself to commission a headstone for Xana’s grave, or experience any kind of joy without also feeling profound sadness. The driver of the car and another passenger were jailed for their part in Xana’s death, and Emma wonders how she will cope when they are let out (both men have since been released).In light of all this, Tony’s estrangement from his own children seems more difficult for Emma than it is for him. “They’re his kids,” she says. “And I know what it’s like to lose kids. If I could sacrifice my relationship to have my daughter back, I would.”Post-wedding comes the revelation that Tony is the father of a ninth child, Shannon, welcomed into the extended family retroactively after a DNA test. When the result comes back, Tony says to her, simply: “Congratulations.” He seems stressed, but pleased, although it is hard to tell with Tony: behind his still expression, his eyes are always darting about warily. “I’m a pretty cold person,” he says. “That’s the way it is.”From the outset, it is clear that a film this painful, honest and sensitive could not have been made without the time it took to establish an extraordinary level of trust between the film-maker and her subjects. It seems a bit odd that Sky, having taken such pains to lay the groundwork for the series, had no correspondingly generous assessment of its audience’s attention : shorn of ad breaks, the whole thing is fewer than 50 minutes long. Partly, of course, the compression is the point – the viewer experiences it as a form of time travel. But three years in under an hour is a brisk trot, one that necessarily leads to some blurring.What you are left with is a closely observed study of two people coping with grief and estrangement with courage, patience and humour. Above all, the film exposes the extraordinarily complex emotional lives of people, who from a distance may seem to be the sort who just get on with things. It reminds you that everyone just gets on with things, and no one does."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f306a20f5249b3d62601500e188dd77d9c4d95/0_16_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2b0aa11dd18336c35ffd9d90dddabf2","title":"los angeles plane dumps fuel schools","story":"Forty children and adults suffer minor irritation after incident as plane makes return to airportA mist of fuel dumped by an airliner with an engine problem as it made an emergency return to Los Angeles international airport fell on several schools Tuesday, causing minor skin and lung irritation to 56 children and adults, officials said.The fuel sprayed out of the plane in two lines and the strong-smelling vapor descended at midday in the city of Cudahy and nearby parts of Los Angeles county, about 13 miles (21km) east of the airport.The vapor fell on five elementary schools, but all injuries were minor and no one was taken to hospitals the Los Angeles county fire department inspector Sky Cornell said. It didn’t force any evacuations.All the fuel evaporated very quickly and nothing flammable remained in the air or on the ground, he said.People were treated with soap and water, the fire inspector Henry Narvaez said.Shortly after takeoff, Delta Air Lines flight 89 to Shanghai “experienced an engine issue requiring the aircraft to return quickly to LAX. The aircraft landed safely after release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight,” the company said in a statement. The airline did not release details about the engine problem.The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating.“There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major US airport,” the FAA said in a statement. “These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomizes and disperses before it reaches the ground.”The FlightAware website’s flight track showed the jet took off over the ocean and made an immediate right turn toward land and circled back over Southern California to approach the airport from the east.Delta said it was in touch with the airport and fire department and shared concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children.The Los Angeles unified school district said its Park Avenue Elementary campus in Cudahy and 93rd Street Elementary had direct impacts from the fuel.Cornell said 31 children and adults were affected at Park Avenue, and 12 at 93rd Street. The rest of those affected were at other schools.The school district said in a statement that paramedics were immediately called to treat anyone complaining of skin irritation or breathing problems and that its environmental health and safety office also responded.Diego Martinez, a Park Avenue sixth-grader, said he and his classmates were outside for physical education class when they saw the airplane flying low overhead.“It was very close,” he said. Shortly afterwards the air filled with the pungent odor of fuel. “It was very strong, the odor,” the 12-year-old said.Diego was not doused but some of his friends complained that their skin was itching.Some teachers at Park Avenue had headaches from the smell, said Antonio Buenabad, area representative for the United Teachers Los Angeles union.They were anxious to get home and shower because the stench was very strong, he said of the teachers.A high school was also affected, but no one was treated there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e44b1afb686bc6019786618c4f18cfc08833d2/0_227_6880_4129/master/6880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57b66730fcdba8975e3503f6fe2670ee","title":"janelle monae non binary pronouns they them","story":"Janelle Monáe just came out as non-binary, joining a growing number of people who use ‘theythem’ as pronouns. You might be wondering how to address themMonáe’s tweet came after the recent announcement of Sam Smith, who recently said they felt “just as much a woman as I am man”. Both celebrities joined the increasing number of young people who identify neither as male or female.Non-binary people tend to prefer using theythem pronouns (although not exclusively – some use she and he interchangeably). If gender neutral pronouns intimidate you, you’re not the only one. As someone who is new to using them (a number of my friends have recently started to identify as non-binary), I confess it can be intimidating when you want to respect someone’s wishes without making any blunders.Putting someone’s dignity before my shyness about how to use a pronoun is, of course, the bare minimum. But I admit to having made mistakes – even avoiding using pronouns in the past, for fear of getting it wrong.It really isn’t that hard, however, to get it right. Reasons for choosing gender neutral pronouns are complex and personal. Some people do it because they don’t feel they fit into a gender. For others, it’s a form of protest: they contest rigid gender expectations and would rather live without them. Being gender non-conforming, right down to their pronouns, is how they choose to identify.So please, if you learn someone uses theythem pronouns, don’t respond: “We get it OK – she’s gay!” – as my friend’s parents recently did.It is normal in the English language to use theythem pronouns when we don’t know the gender of the person to which we’re referring, or if we want our sentence to be applicable to all genders.This isn’t new – the saying “Everybody loves their own mother” has been used since around late 1300. Both Jane Austen and Geoffrey Chaucer – who died in 1400 - used pronouns that way.While it is no longer grammatically incorrect to use theythem as singular anymore, people still get confused about it. A friend’s parent recently responded to their pronouns, saying: “But if I tell Shelly you’re coming round for dinner, she’ll think you’re bringing extra people!”Try this: if you are using the pronoun in a scenario where there is no confusion over singular versus plural, just go ahead and use it (“You are going to meet my friend Poppy today, I hope you like them”).If you are using it in an instance where it might be misconstrued as plural, you can change the first part of the sentence to make it clear (“I may bring a friend, their name is Poppy”).If you still feel that is confusing, you can be explicit (“I asked Poppy – who uses theythem pronouns – they might come”). This also takes the onus off your non-binary friend for having to explain it themselves later.Avoid assuming every person’s gender. Feel free to ask people when you meet them what pronouns they use. Feel free to put your own pronouns in your email signature, or to introduce people using your pronouns (this can take the focus off non-binary people having to do all the work).Embrace doing your own research on pronouns, without expecting non-binary people to educate you. Encourage open dialogue, which means being open about your own shortcomings or fears, when relevant. Ensure this is a means to steer conversation forward (“Hey, did I get that right just then?”) not back (“Well actually this is pretty scary for me, so you shouldn’t correct me”).People may use your respect for another’s pronouns as a means to argue with you about the broader political context around gender andor LGBTQ rights. But you don’t need to be needlessly drawn into an argument unless that’s where you want to go. Briefly explain why you are doing it, and if the challenge escalates, consider shutting down the conflict (“It’s my choice to respect their wishes” or even the more direct “I don’t want to argue about this”).When you make a mistake, apologize, be gracious, and move on. Generally people aren’t out to get you. Don’t get too hung up: my experience is that people know getting it wrong is part of the process and are forgiving if they feel you are trying your best.Sometimes you can check that you said the right thing first, rather than getting caught up in your head (“Hey, when I said that, was it offensive?’). Above all, recognize mistakes happen and apologies are OK, but don’t mistake them for real work. Saying sorry a handful of times might be fine, but if you’re misgendering someone over and over again you might want to think about why, and do better.Exposure is key. Keep using theythem, and soon it will feel normal. That’s the aim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80101a34cd51c442f0cec8ae998a6f84dcaa12ca/100_509_7190_4314/master/7190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4d997accc134c80dfad8958bb4b5e8","title":"school lunch liberia london","story":"By providing free school meals to some of the poorest children on Earth, a UK charity is also ensuring they get an education by  Joanna Moorhead in Tubmanburg and Monrovia, LiberiaIt’s breakfast time in Domagbamatma (population: 63) in the depths of the Liberian rainforest, but there’s no food in evidence in the home of Massa Kamara. The eight-year-old has been up since dawn, collecting firewood, fetching water.Now she’s ready for school in a crisp white shirt and navy-blue skirt in her family’s muddy, two-room shack.In the narrow porch there’s a pile of rags, some carrier bags, a few bowls and a couple of plastic chairs. In a UK home it would look like stuff waiting to go to the tip. Here, it represents this family’s entire earthly possessions.Liberia is one of the poorest countries on Earth, and the Kamaras are one of its poorest families. They eke out a living growing vegetables on the land around the shack.In families that hover as close to subsistence as this one, sending their children to school makes little sense. Learning to read and write, to do addition and subtraction, might be an investment in a long-term future, but it doesn’t put food on the table today or tomorrow.And yet Massa is setting off on the 40-minute trek to school. This morning it’s dry: when the rain is pouring down, as it often does at this time of year, Massa carries her uniform in an old carrier bag to keep it dry, and changes into it when she reaches school. As we walk she speaks of the subject she likes best (English), her friends, and how she hopes one day to move to the city.At the Vorkor public school in a village near the regional centre Tubmanburg, smoke is curling from an open-sided “kitchen”, where several women are busy over a fire preparing today’s dinner in vast pots. In a couple of hours’ time, Massa, who has an old margarine tub in her bag, will line up with her classmates to have it filled with rice and beans. At Vorkor, mealtime isn’t just an important part of the pupils’ day: it’s the most important part of the day. And it’s because her family know she will receive a nutritious meal here that they make sure Massa never misses school.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThree thousand miles away, at roughly the same time, pupils at Good Shepherd primary in west London are also sitting down to their lunch and though they don’t know Massa and haven’t even heard of Vorkor school, pupils at the two schools are crucially connected. Because students at Good Shepherd are fundraisers for Mary’s Meals, the NGO that funds school dinners at Vorkor and 2,357 other schools in 18 countries across the world. And while the charity’s supporters come from across the entire community, in the UK and elsewhere, there’s something particularly heartwarming about the idea of kids in one part of the world trying to make things fairer for children somewhere else.That’s very much how it’s seen at Good Shepherd primary, according to the school’s headteacher, Imogen Lavelle. “We believe it’s our duty to help schools in countries such as Liberia,” she says. “So far we’ve raised more than £3,000 – the children have had own-clothes days, wear-your-pyjamas-to-school days, cake sales.”That £3,000 will go a long way: it costs Mary’s Meals the astonishingly small sum of £13.90 to feed a child for a whole school year, so the Good Shepherd is feeding a school of roughly the same sort of size as it is, around 250 pupils, from one end of the academic year to the other. That means a lot to Good Shepherd pupils such as Nathan Olano, 10, who’s in Year 6.It gives children at Good Shepherd plenty of food for thought. “I sometimes think about what it would be like to go to school and get no lunch,” says Nathan’s classmate Darcie Meade, also 10. “Especially if you’ve had no breakfast either. Raising money for schoolchildren in countries like Liberia has made me a lot more aware of how the world is stacked against some communities.”Evi Chaudhari, also 10, says it’s given her hope – not just for children like Massa, but for her entire generation across the planet. “It makes me feel that if we can change the world while we’re still kids, how much more can we do when we’re older?”“One meal for one child costs just 7p – that’s pocket money even the youngest children have,” says Kim Webster, a spokesperson for Mary’s Meals. At a time when development often seems overwhelmingly complex and expensive, the easy digestibility and comparative cheapness of the need to feed and educate children is a big part of its success. And Mary’s Meals manages to keep overheads low by recruiting volunteers – in practice these are usually mothers or grandmothers with kids in the relevant school – to run their kitchens.Even in the regions and schools that Mary’s Meals support, the terrain and weather conditions sometimes make food deliveries impossible. On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded.Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia.One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother’s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family.Before Ebola, of course, there was civil war, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted.At another school, there is a boy who’s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He’s 19, but he’s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. “I looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers I had to fetch and carry for him,” he explains. “I was just a small kid – I had no chance on my own.” He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah he works on a farm to support himself.“I don’t expect to see my parents again – I’ve no idea what happened to them. The only way I can have a future is if I provide one for myself – and I’m doing my best to do that.” Getting fed at school, he tells me, is the deal-breaker that makes it possible for him to afford to be educated, and furthers his dream of one day going to college.Seeing Waharbu’s tall frame squeezed behind a dilapidated desk, paying careful attention to the young man just a few years older than him who’s teaching reading from the school’s single blackboard, is a humbling experience. He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they’re fundraising, but what Mary’s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.Mary’s Meals paid for Joanna Moorhead’s visit to Liberia"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139589.1579018174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"m7 upgrade speed restrictions to be lifted on new three lane carriageway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorks on sections of the   M7 upgrade are ongoing. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Speed restrictions on the new three-lane carriageway on the M7 motorway in Co Kildare will be lifted in mid February, according to the latest project update from Kildare County Council.The M7 Naas widening scheme was originally due to have been completed last April, with the Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange due to be completed later this year.But in the latest update issued on Tuesday, the council said the works would now be completed by mid- February.The announcement means the temporary 80 kmh speed limit remains in place on the M7.Final works on the M7 include drainage at Junction 10 Newhall and at a number of verge locations at Newhall and Lewistown.The council said “pending completion of these works, and in the interests of both worker and public safety, the temporary 80 kmh speed limit is being maintained.”The council said, however, that traffic on the M7 would not be able to use the new interchange at Osberstown to access Naas until the Sallins bypass opens.All three lanes of the upgraded M7 are currently operating at a reduced speed limit of 80kmh from junction eight Johnstown to the M7M9 interchange at junction 11.Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) said the M7 remains an “active construction site”.Construction began on widening a 13.5km stretch of the M7 in January of 2018. It was originally anticipated by the contractors SIAC and Colas that all three lanes would be in operation in both directions by last April.Figures from TII show 14,500 speeding fines have been issued along the road over a period of about 18 months to last August.Local District Court Judge Desmond Zaidan and the Courts Service have both raised concerns over how to deal with the increase in cases arising from the speed checks.The M7 is used by some 78,000 vehicles per day.The upgrade project also involved the replacement and relocation of the existing ramps at Junction 10 Naas South Newhall to the main Naas Newbridge dual carriageway, the construction of a new interchange at Osberstown and a new Sallins bypass."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"University Hospital Limerick employees may face disciplinary action for leaking confidential patient informationJudiciary and politicians who opposed controversial legislation welcome its lapsing with dissolution of D\u0026aacuteilMore than 92,000 vehicles examined at test centres in 2019 found to be unroadworthyPrisoner unable to leave cell because no walking stick was availableOpposition leaders focus on FG\u0026rsquos record on health and housing as vote is calledOf 25 inspection reports, a good level of compliance was found in 19 centresAccepting award, the priest told Prince William he was praying for his familyHundreds of farmers expected to take part in demonstration over beef pricesCatholic preacher promotes chastity among teenagers, was to speak at schools, churchesFG, FF and Labour nominate just enough female election candidates for State fundingDate of the general election creates uncertainty for recently registered votersTaoiseach says now is the best time for vote as President Higgins dissolves 32nd D\u0026aacuteilFormer Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn reportedly fled Japan hidden inside instrument caseSinn F\u0026eacutein MEP Matt Carthy also confirms he is seeking to contest the general electionStudy finds clothes washed in colder water last longer, with less energy used for cleaningState Examinations Commission paper illuminates process of grade consistency"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139551.1579015142!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"one in 15 cars taking nct unsafe to drive on public roads","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAs a result of the implementation of an EU directive on roadworthiness tests on motor vehicles since 2018, all defects are now classified as either minor, major or dangerous. Photograph: Getty Images One in every 15 cars submitted for the national car test last year were found to be dangerously defective and unsafe to be driven on public roads.Figures published by the Road Safety Authority (RSA) show more than 92,000 vehicles examined at NCT test centres during 2019 were found to be in an unroadworthy condition.A total of 92,523 cars were classified as “fail dangerous”.They represent 6.6 per cent of almost 1.4 million cars tested at 47 test centres nationwide last year.Although the vast majority subsequently obtained a NCT, a total of 2,791 vehicles were still found to be dangerously defective following a retest.According to the RSA, tyres in poor condition and problems with brakes are the main reason why cars are deemed dangerous to drive on public roads.An authority spokesperson said the large number of cars being classified as “fail dangerous” was not surprising.As a result of the implementation of an EU directive on roadworthiness tests on motor vehicles since 2018, all defects are now classified as either minor, major or dangerous.‘Still unaware’“Many motorists are still unaware about the change in classification and there is a need to educate car owners that there are some problems which will have their vehicle deemed unsafe to drive on public roads and that they need to take the issue seriously,” the spokesperson said.A recent survey by the RSA indicated that 40 per cent of all car owners used the NCT as a diagnostic tool for problems with their vehicles, which the RSA claims explains the higher failure rate for the initial test.“People need to stop using the NCT to identify problems with their car. They should be getting it serviced regularly by a mechanic as it is a much more detailed examination. The NCT can never be a substitute for a full service,” said the RSA spokesperson.Neither the RSA nor Applus, the operator of the NCT, collect information on the number of people who still drive away from NCT centres in an unroadworthy vehicle or who arrange to have their car towed away.The RSA spokesperson said anyone who continued to drive a vehicle after it was deemed dangerously defective was “irresponsible”.Any motorist whose vehicle is classified as “fail dangerous” is advised that it is unsafe to be used on the road “under any circumstances”.A sticker stating “failed dangerous” is placed on such vehicles by NCT inspectors at the end of a test.‘Illegal’“It is illegal for a vehicle to be driven on a public road with dangerous defects which means the driver may incur penalty points and a court appearance if caught by An Garda Síochána,” the RSA spokesperson said.Any motorist detected driving an unroadworthy vehicle is liable for a fine of up to €2,000 and five penalty points andor a three-month jail term.The RSA said gardaí were automatically notified via the National Vehicle and Driver File of any vehicle that was overdue its test by three months.Such information is also now available to gardaí at roadside checkpoints. They are equipped with hand-held devices for checking on the licensing status of drivers and vehicles stopped.RSA figures show 50 per cent of all cars which underwent a NCT last year passed the full test – up from 49.1 per cent in 2018.In addition to the “fail dangerous” vehicles, more than 603,000 other cars also failed the test.The figures indicate that more than 41,500 vehicles that did not pass the full test were not submitted for a retest.Cars first registered in 2015, 2013, 2011, 2009 and any older vehicles were due for testing last year.The RSA confirmed recently it had required Applus to pilot changes to the testing of a vehicle’s suspension.Fatal traffic collisionIt follows a €31,000 award by Cork Circuit Civil Court against Applus for failing to spot a faulty suspension in a vehicle, which was subsequently involved in a fatal traffic collision.A post-collision report found the vehicle to be unroadworthy both at the time of its involvement in a fatal crash near Fota, Co Cork, in December 2012 and when it passed the NCT seven months earlier.The driver of the vehicle, Cork woman Amanda O’Flaherty (26), was killed after the car veered suddenly into the path of an oncoming vehicle."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139571.1579016944!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big two to slug it out in most open election for years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Martin (right), leader of Fianna Fáil, speaks to the media in Dublin after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar confirmed Ireland’s next general election will be held on Saturday, February 8th. Photograph: Damien EagersPA WireCalled a bit sooner than expected, to be held a bit later than expected.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar decided there was no point hanging around, and rather than wait for it to return tomorrow, he will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin later today to ask the President to formally bring the 32nd Dáil to an end.Ministers remain ministers until someone else takes over, but TDs will no longer be TDs.The election will take place on February 8th, which is a Saturday. This is unusual - recent elections have all been held on a Friday, and before that they were held on Thursdays. It paves the way for a campaign that will be three-and-a-half weeks long - though it may feel longer.Like the last two general elections, a February poll, and a campaign fought not on long summer evenings - as Varadkar had initially suggested - but in the dark, wet and cold of winter.That will enhance the importance of the “air war” - a campaign fought in the media and over the airwaves - while the “ground war” of knocking on doors and personally engaging voters will be more difficult.Difficult but still important - election studies consistently emphasise the importance in the Irish electoral system of personal approaches to voters. For all the complaints that they are insulated from the lives of ordinary people, Irish politicians in all parties remain remarkably close to the electorate.Extreme anxietyIf they don’t, they lose their seats. All politicians suffer from extreme anxiety about their own seats at election time.Campaigning will be frantic and cacophonous in the coming days as the parties stake out their territory and attack their opponents.Party managers will be opening up their campaign headquarters today and rolling out the message and activity grids they have finalised in recent weeks and which plot out the daily business of the campaigns for all parties.The big two parties will slug it out on their respective records in government and their plans for the future. Elections are about the future, but the credibility of the parties’ promises is influenced greatly by their behaviour in the past.The smaller parties will seek to elbow their way into the debate with sharp and distinctive messages.They’ll get less airtime and fewer column inches than the big parties, so making full use of the coverage they do get is imperative. Spinning from everyone will be dialled up to the maximum immediately.Polls suggest the most open election in many years. The last Ipsos MRBI poll in October gave Fine Gael a small lead, but figures in both big parties accept that there is little between them.Both reckon they can gain seats - but who can gain the most? Fine Gael goes into the campaign with 47 seats, Fianna Fáil with 46, but all the Fianna Fáil TDs are standing for re-election, whereas Fine Gael has several high profile retirees, like Michael Noonan, Enda Kenny and Sean Barrett.‘Coalitionology’And neither of the big parties will come anywhere near the 80 seats required for a majority when the new Dáil meets. That means that the question of how and with whom the next government is formed - derided by Micheál Martin during the last election as “coalitionology” - will be a central one for this campaign. Both big parties are ruling out Sinn Féin, a stance they will be repeatedly required to justify.But the Greens (especially), Labour, the Social Democrats, independents and small parties will also be required to spell out their intentions.A long period of government formation is likely to follow the meeting of a new Dáil, with the numbers dictating the realm of the possible. A return to some form of confidence and supply is not impossible.The transformation of the Irish political landscape as a result of the economic crash of 2008-2011 has meant that government formation is now a much more difficult business.In a way, there are two phases in deciding the future leadership of the country - the election, in which the voters get their say, and then the construction of the new government, in which it’s over to the politicians.The winner of the first phase has the advantage in the second.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139688.1579021516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il mep says he cannot vote for brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil MEP Billy Kelleher has sent  a letter to Tánaiste Simon Coveney concerning the rights of IrishEU citizens in Northern Ireland. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons  The  In a letter to Tánaiste Simon Coveney, the Ireland South MEP says that while he recognised the importance of the agreement passing to avoid a damaging no-deal Brexit, he was “very concerned” that the UK may seek to dilute the rights of IrishEU citizens in Northern Ireland after Brexit.“In all conscience, I cannot vote for an agreement that is so vague and leaves it open for a dilution of citizens’ rights into the future,” said Mr Kelleher in the letter sent last week.“EU citizens in Northern Ireland need clarity and confirmation that their futures are protected and that they cannot be used as future bargaining chips.”The Cork politician asked the Tánaiste to raise the issue at EU Council level with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Mr Kelleher told The  that he had also raised his concerns in letters to the British prime minister Boris Johnson and the European Commission.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin was aware of his concerns and the position he had taken on the agreement, he said. He pointed out that the European Parliament had a right to debate the issue as part of the EU’s ratification of the withdrawal agreement.“If you don’t raise these issues in advance, well then there is no point in I saying afterwards that maybe I should have done something differently,” said Mr Kelleher.The European Parliament is due to vote on the agreement on January 29th. This is the last legal hurdle before the agreement comes into effect and the UK departs the EU on January 31st.The MEP said that if his concerns about IrishEU citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland were not addressed in “an impartial, independent manner”, then he would have “grave concerns” about the withdrawal deal “without having any ability to deal with these issues at a later stage”.‘This is their home’In his letter – seen by The  – Mr Kelleher says that “of most concern” to him about the withdrawal agreement are the “hundreds of thousands of EU citizens living in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of whom are Irish citizens.“When Brexit does happen, there will be more EU citizens in Northern Ireland than there are in some member states such as Luxembourg or Malta, ” he said.“These IrishEU citizens have done nothing to deserve this. They have consistently voted remain in the referendum and general elections since 2016.“They were born here and this is their home. They supported the Good Friday Agreement on the assumption of continued EU membership.”Mr Kelleher said EU citizens from the other 26 member states who had made Northern Ireland their home and started families with other IrishEU citizens were “now in complete limbo”.The withdrawal agreement made no explicit reference to IrishEU citizens born and living in Northern Ireland, he wrote, stressing that they were not the same as French or Dutch nationals living in London and “should be treated in a different way”.He told The  that an Irish citizen living in Dublin who is married to a French national may have to apply for “settled status” from the UK if they decided to move to Belfast.“That just diminishes the free movement of people in terms of working North and South and the co-operation built up over the last 21 years since the Good Friday Agreement was passed,” he said.Brexit has renewed general concerns in Northern Ireland about the birthright status of citizens to identify as Irish or British or both under the 1998 Belfast Agreement and in turn their right to EU protections if they consider themselves IrishEU citizens.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Decision made.As his Ministers watched in silence, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar turned to sign the order requesting the dissolution of his Government. He hesitated suddenly, pen poised above the document. He looked around the table.“Anyone want me to change my mind?”And finally, after a soggy morning of giddy anticipation around Leinster House, Leo appeared at the steps of a rain-lashed Government Buildings and called time.He did it in two languages, reminding voters he always said he would go for an election when the moment is right.“Anois an t-am sin,” the Taoiseach declared portentously. “Now is that time.”At least it was, until he decided to start tinkering with the clock, confusing matters mid-speech and announcing, by way of Brexit, “in fact, it’s only half time.”Tuesday’s brief history of Day One saw Fine Gael further mangling time with the low-key unveiling of a grammatically off-key campaign slogan. First sightings of election literature revealed the limp rallying cry: “A future to look forward to.”Dominic Cummings must be seething with envy.Posters began bothering lampposts in the morning while the Cabinet was still meeting and hours before the election date was formally announced. In fact, even the Taoiseach’s posters got up early in the morning.Favourite catchphraseThat may be because someone in the party was being really clever around Leo’s favourite catchphrase about looking after the people who get up early in the morning such as office cleaners and Cork-based TDs catching flights to Brussels. But, judging by the campaign slogan, that’s highly unlikely.“A future to look forward to.” It fairly trips off the tongue. Mr Micawber would approve. The team had been keen to sign off on “Something will turn up” until a minion realised Dickens got there first.Of course, it has to be about the future, going forward. Although, in the space-time continuum, there are endless possibilities.A future to look forward to.A present to look away from.A past to make a bags of.As Kung Fu Panda once said: “Today is history, tomorrow is a mystery.” But what if their great future turns out to be behind them?This is where Brexit comes in. It is Fine Gael’s election trump card and was produced with a proud flourish by the Taoiseach in the opening minutes of what will be 3½ weeks of out-Borising Boris on the Brexit front. In an opening salvo delivered to an audience of cold and rain-sodden hacks in the courtyard of Government Buildings, Leo’s message was very simple: We will get Brexit done.His negotiating team in Europe, led by Simon Coveney and Helen McEntee, is seen to have done an excellent job in this regard on the country’s behalf over the last couple of years. Now, the push is on to allow them continue in their roles for the greater good. It’s a persuasive pitch and, by far, Fine Gael’s best line.PackagedThe Taoiseach could have made his announcement indoors, but the imposing backdrop of Government Buildings was the perfect setting for a man being packaged in this election as a European statesman with proven leadership credentials on the international stage.“We have the team. We have the track record. We have the plans,” he proclaimed at the end of his speech, rapidly turning on his heels and scuttling inside. There would be not questions from the media. It will be interesting to see if that policy continues.His party has recycled its slogan from the last general election, which is very on trend.“All Ireland for all in de turtyturd Dáil”. Or maybe just “An Ireland for all”.“It’s not a slogan,” he insisted, nipping in for a sneaky press conference in the half hour before the Taoiseach fired the starting gun. “It’s a philosophy. It’s a viewpoint.” He also called it “a philosophy, slogan”.He was joined by his finance spokesman Michael McGrath and front benchers Niamh Smith and Lisa Chambers for this early philosophical dander around “a very, very relevant political viewpoint”. We hadn’t seen Lisa since before the Christmas break and were delighted to discover she will be concerned with more than political developments in the weeks and months to come.First childShe is expecting her first child around the middle of April. “It’s going to be a busy and eventful start to the year, that’s for sure,” said Lisa afterwards.But think of poor Micheál, who has been expecting for years now. This time though, Fianna Fail is nursing very real hopes that their leader can finally make it to the Taoiseach’s office. He was certainly in high spirits on Tuesday.“The ground campaign will be very important,” he stressed. And the importance of the doors cannot be underestimated either, said the Fianna Fáil leader, who intends to carry on his proud election tradition of racing around the country like a man possessed.“I’ve been on the doors a number of years now.”While the Taoiseach will be busy pointing to the strong economy and the number of people working in the country, the Fianna Fáil leader will be busy pointing out that “things are not working in the country”.If Leo was all about Brexit and broad economic figures in his first outing, Micheál was all about housing and health in his opening performance. “Things are simply not working in this country in so many areas,” he argued. His party will be putting forward “a positive, comprehensive agenda” to change this.He had a little chuckle at Fine Gael’s slogan about looking forward to the future. “It kinda reveals the essence of this Fine Gael party. Everything is a way into the future.” People can’t wait for FG’s future, he reckoned, while touching only on the nice things about Fianna Fáil’s past.‘Cold spines’Apparently they put “the backbone” into the fiscal recovery while “there’ll be a certain sort of shiver going about the country” when people contemplate a Fine Gael future. As his predecessor Bertie Ahern once said: “It’s enough to send cold spines up and down your back”.As the circus rolled into town, Finian McGrath was preparing to pack up and move out. The popular Minister of State announced he would not be seeking re-election and the leafy groves of Dublin Bay North reverberated with the joyful cries of Labour Senator and former TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.Senator Michael McDowell, delighted to see the Judicial Appointments Bill he fiercely opposed in the Seanad die with this Government, announced he would not be running for the Dáil. This came as a surprise to many as the former tánaiste seemed very keen to return to the Lower House.Perhaps he took some soundings on his prospects in Dublin Bay South. Finian may have done the same across the bay. And then, as the late Larry Gogan might have said, “Aah, sure the polls didn’t suit you.”The Taoiseach takes his half-time Brexit roadshow to Monaghan on Wednesday where he will be showing off Simon and Helen while burnishing his rural credentials."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Keep up to speed with The \u0026#39s two-minute audio briefingsNeed a better way to keep up-to-date?

We did so with the permission of Westminster City Council and the Mayor’s Office. Although we had been let down by the government, and remained stuck in the bloc, a good-natured atmosphere prevailed.Given that background, I had thought it would be a formality to get permission from the same authorities this time around. Yet still nothing has been sanctioned at an official level.There is certainly a demand for it. As a result of the Brexit Party sending just one email, more than 15,000 people have registered their willingness to attend. We hope for positive news from the Mayor’s office. We need it quickly to make this gathering a success. But I am beginning to think the attempts to block this celebration go to the heart of government.The Leave Means Leave rally on 29th March 2019Soon after the Brexit Party chairman, Richard Tice, and I announced we were planning this event, No 10 announced that it would also be marking this moment. Oddly, so far, no tangible arrangements have been confirmed. And, with the exception of Tory MP Mark Francois, those who I had assumed would be most enthusiastic about this bash – such as the ERG faction of Conservative MPs – have been actively putting people off coming to speak. Why would they do this? The answer, apparently, is that Nigel Farage will dominate it. This really is pathetic. They are all welcome to attend, to join in, and to speak. But perhaps the worst of the obstruction we face comes from the House of Commons Commission. This administrative body has claimed it will cost £500,000 for Big Ben, which is undergoing repair, to chime at the appointed hour. Really? It tolled on New Year’s Eve, on Remembrance Sunday and on Armistice Day. Did this cost £500,000 on each occasion? I would love to know the answer.If money really is the problem, crowdfunding plans have already been hatched. Businessmen including Lord Ashcroft have offered to underwrite this effort. Given the amount of public cash-raising schemes launched since 2016 by Remainers in their various bids to derail Brexit, there would be a certain sweetness in our paying en masse for Big Ben to work its magic in any case.The prime minister has said the government is “working up” a strategy to allow people to donate cash to pay for Big Ben to bong. He must go further. Can the Government underwrite it? If they are serious about Brexit and not embarrassed by it, they would make this commitment. Either way, this must move quickly.Come on, Boris. Announce that Big Ben will chime. And then appear on stage in Parliament Square as Prime Minister to mark this extraordinary date.

He was detained for several hours, before Iran’s foreign ministry intervened and arranged for his release.An effigy of the ambassador, who took up the role two years ago, and a Union Jack flag were burned in Tehran.“It is not acceptable for us to see that the British ambassador went outside the embassy and took part in an illegal gathering, filmed it and had a provocative role in its continuation,” Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, told reporters. “This person is persona non grata ... while people’s expectations and international regulations necessitate his expulsion.”Iranian hardliners burn a cutout poster depicting British ambassador to Iran Robert MacaireIran’s general prosecutor urged the government to expel the ambassador.Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a prominent hardline cleric, said expelling the ambassador would be the best thing that can happen to him as otherwise loyal supporters of general Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike earlier this month, would chop him to small pieces.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Minister, said the UK government had received no formal notification that Mr Macaire would be expelled, adding that any such action would be “regrettable”.The UK has attempted to distance itself from the US decision to assassinate Soleimani, widely considered to be the second most important figure in the Islamic Republic. Britain was not given advance notice of the plan.Tehran, however, has kept up the pressure on the UK, which it often refers to as “Little Satan” to the US’s “Big Satan”.The ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement calling on the UK embassy in Tehran to “stop any meddling and provocative measure immediately.“The people of Iran do not accept foreign interference, particularly from governments with a record of colonialism, such as Britain,” it said.The judiciary also announced the arrest of a number of people over the downing of the Ukranian Airlines jet by Iran’s missile defence system, which killed all 176 on board.Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, which lost 63 nationals in the crash, took an extraordinary swipe at Mr Trump, saying the victims would be with their families if not for the US president’s decision to target Soleimani.I think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families, Mr Trudeau said.Boris Johnson calls for \u0026#39Trump deal\u0026#39 with Iran as UK and allies trigger dispute mechanism over nuclear violationsDuchess of Sussex visits women\u0026#39s centre in Vancouver in first public engagement since Royal Family \u0026#39split\u0026#39Children injured in Los Angeles as plane dumps fuel onto school during emergency landingBoris Johnson interview: Bung a bob for Big Ben bong, Brexiteers toldMore than 17 miles of potholes recorded last year as businesses urge Boris Johnson to actClimate change could see UK seas filled with hake, anchovies and herring, study by Defra predicts Half of sea turtles have ingested plastic, study finds, as Greenpeace warns they could become extinct SNP Finance Minister to publish \u0026#39alternative\u0026#39 economic case for independence on same day as official Scottish deficit figuresPub \u0026#39banter\u0026#39 and social media posts can be sexual harassment, equality watchdog warns bossesFour in five GP partners plan to reject proposed NHS deal   Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s father set to testify in court against her as text messages detailing their fall-out are revealed Comment: From Harry and Meghan to Brexit, our system isn\u0026#39t so \u0026#39broken\u0026#39 after allDuchess of Sussex moves business interests to Delaware, the US \u0026#39corporate haven\u0026#39 beloved by the super-richMomentum accused of Labour leadership \u0026#39stitch up\u0026#39 as members only given choice of backing Rebecca Long-Bailey Comment: Nicola Sturgeon once said Scotland\u0026#39s indyref was a ‘once in a lifetime’ event - it\u0026#39s time she remembered thatSwedish army officer promoted to senior positions despite faking his qualificationsBoris Johnson orders all departments to take action to crackdown on crimeJames Murdoch attacks his father\u0026#39s news empire over \u0026#39ongoing denial\u0026#39 about climate changePope Benedict demands his name is taken off controversial new book criticising current Pope FrancisWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/14/TELEMMGLPICT000220670272_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOdFb9CYjF5zqGRm4XH9tyWd02aIXpNu2YnLTBIbEGeA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tuesday evening news briefing meghan markle missed sandringham","story":"The Duchess of Sussex did not dial into the Sandringham summitDuchess of SussexIf you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile, making it difficult to attribute specific events or reasons to market movements.But the volatility, combined with a lack of mainstream applications, means bitcoin is consistently referred to as digital gold because it is more commonly used\u0026nbspas a store of value than a currency.Bitcoin is digital gold, explained\u0026nbspBrooke Stoddard, an investor and former Goldman Sachs associate. Bitcoin and gold are borderless, decentralised, and verifiable. Both are worth something, they store value. But bitcoin is easier to transfer, ide, and harder to counterfeit.Bitcoin\u0027s price is therefore often compared with that of gold, though research suggests the two are not linked.Bitcoin has risen by more than 20 per cent since the start of 2020, however it fell by nearly a third between October and November last year during a time of similar uncertainty when the Trump administration was ramping up sanctions on China and the UK\u0027s future in the UK was unclear.Why bitcoin\u0027s bumpy revolution is only just beginningCryptocurrency trader and author Glen Goodman rejected any relation between bitcoin\u0027s price and the US assassination of\u0026nbspSoleimani, or the subsequent Iranian missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq.Bitcoin was already in a strong uptrend before the missiles hit, Mr Goodman wrote on Twitter following the attacks.\u0026nbspGold rose and stocks fell initially, but traders soon relaxed, so stocks recovered and gold fell. Bitcoin stayed high because its rise is not Iran-related.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

portfolio that it will start offloading investments it considers to be a climate change risk, including thermal coal.BlackRock\u0026nbspchief executive Larry Fink wrote to bosses of many of the world’s largest corporations to tell them that the climate crisis is about to trigger a “fundamental reshaping of finance”.Mr Fink, who has faced criticism for a perceived failure to act on climate change, said rising global temperatures were altering the long-term prospects of companies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital,” he wrote.BlackRock\u0026nbspalso acknowledged that investing sustainably has the potential to offer better returns to investors.\u0026nbspCreated with

believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing,” the company wrote in a separate letter to clients.The company said it would begin exiting industries that are most at risk as the world shifts to a low-carbon future, including thermal coal.BlackRock’s stance will pile pressure on other asset managers to reassess their own approaches to climate risks.It is perhaps the clearest indication that asset managers, as custodians of a significant chunk of the world’s wealth, have recognised the key role they could play in tackling the climate crisis.But campaigners remained sceptical about BlackRock’s commitment to protecting the planet, preferring to wait for actions rather than words.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBlackRock remains one of the world’s largest backers of fossil fuel companies and has consistently voted against shareholder resolutions designed to push company boards to limit their impact on the climate.That has frustrated campaigners who see BlackRock as a key potential influencer of corporate policies.The new approach applies only to BlackRock’s\u0026nbsp$1.8 trillion of actively managed assets. The remaining $5 trillion of its funds are passive, meaning it\u0026nbspsimply allocates clients’\u0026nbspmoney\u0026nbspto a basket of stocks and bonds weighted in such a way as to track indexes such as the FTSE 100, for example.Investment giant threatens to pull funds from gunmakersBecause oil and gas companies account for a significant slice of major stock markets, BlackRock will remain heavily invested in them unless it makes further policy changes.Jeanne Martin, campaign manager at ShareAction said: “Larry Fink talks a lot about companies’ purpose, but there are questions left unanswered about what BlackRock’s own purpose is, and how its stewardship delivers the social, environmental, and financial performance that its clients are looking for.“While we welcome its commitment to improve transparency of its stewardship activities, for far too long the asset manager has kept everyone in the dark about the companies it was meeting with, the topics discussed, and most importantly the outcome of those engagements.\u0026nbsp“But we might not like what we see when we open the door on these activities: BlackRock’s current voting disclosures on climate issues give little comfort that it will vote in a manner fitting of the climate crisis.”Ms Martin added: “BlackRock’s coal estment decision is yet another significant blow to the already dying market.”The ShareAction\u0026nbspcharity is calling on the fund manager to go further by using its voting rights to pressure banks to stop financing coal.BlackRock’s announcement comes a day after almost all of Britain’s top universities committed to selling their shares in fossil fuel companies after pressure from eco-conscious students who have occupied buildings and carried out hunger strikes.\u0026nbspCharlie Kronick, climate finance campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said:\u0026nbsp“BlackRock’s announcement this morning is an acknowledgement of the culpability of the financial sector for the climate emergency, their responsibility to fix it, and the impossibility of carrying on business as usual now that the world is awake to the crisis we have created.\u0026nbsp“Barclays Bank and other UK institutions financing fossil fuel expansion need to step up and do the same, and do it quickly, if they want to avoid becoming the target of unprecedented pressure from activists and investors to end their ongoing funding of the climate emergency.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is more of a cultural thing.”One school\u0026nbspMs Miller is hoping to apply to says boys’ hair should not\u0026nbspbe “too long”, but girls are allowed long hair if it is tied back. “That comes under the umbrella of sexism,” she said.Schools unfairly punish black students for hair and ‘kissing teeth\u0027“Why can you say a boy has to have short hair and a girl is allowed to have long hair? It is prejudice,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbspMs Miller added: “It is the same as girls having to wear skirts. Why should they have to wear skirts to school?

Such burst gravitational ways could be an important way of doing so – but are yet to be found, and scientists don\u0027t know exactly what they will look like.Star is acting strangely and may be about to explode, astronomers sayLIGO describes them as the gravitational waves that go bump in the night, and scientists admit there is little understanding of where they may come from. While astrophysicists have long predicted they may happen, there is too little information about the parts of the universe that would spawn them to say when they might arrive or how they will appear when they do.Searching for burst gravitational waves requires being utterly open-minded, the LIGO website reads. For these kinds of gravitational waves, scientists must\u0026nbsprecognize\u0026nbspa pattern of signals even when such a pattern has not been predicted or\u0026nbspmodeled\u0026nbsp(what we think a signal may look like) before. If you don’t know what you’re looking for, it’s really hard to find it.While this makes searching for burst gravitational waves difficult, detecting them has the greatest potential to reveal revolutionary information about the Universe.Some have speculated that the wave could have come from Betelgeuse, a nearby star that is behaving oddly and could be about to explode into a supernova. But that star still appears to be in place, and the wave does not seem to have come from the correct part of the sky.Michael Merrifield,\u0026nbspprofessor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, described the event as weird on Twitter, and suggested that further observation should give more detail on where it had come from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the question of how that came to be, and why the materials from the inner and outer parts of the solar system did not mix, has continued to perplex scientists.Scientists explain the mysterious stripes spotted on an alien moonNow scientists have proposed an answer, in a new paper published in the journal Nature Astronomy.They say the solution might lie in the very beginnings of the solar system, and our young sun, when all that surrounds us today existed as a disc around the star. The differences between the planets began even before they had been formed, scientists said.The most likely explanation for that compositional difference is that it emerged from an intrinsic structure of this disk of gas and dust, said\u0026nbspStephen\u0026nbspMojzsis, on of the authors of the paper.Such discs have been found around other distant, young stars. And so the scientists suggest that if we had one of our own, it could have created the great ide.It served as a barrier that pulled the materials into different parts of the early solar system – and which would go on to form its planets.But the barrier did let some materials through, and on Earth those would be the ones that would go on to help form life.Those materials that might go to the Earth would be those volatile, carbon-rich materials,\u0026nbspMojzsis\u0026nbspsaid. And that gives you water. It gives you organics.Previously, researchers have suggested that Jupiter was the cause of the ide. But by conducting computer simulations of what it would have done in the early solar system, the researchers found that it was not big enough to get in the way of the flow of rocky material on its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Minding the GapOne of the year’s biggest cinematic curveballs occurs at the midway point of this stirring documentary. Billed as a film about small-town US skate culture, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap grows into a haunting depiction of class and masculinity, and how once inseparable groups of friends tend to untangle and erge as they come of age. Few of 2019’s films cast quite as long a shadow. Adam WhiteThe Farewell rips your heart out of your chest. Then it hands it back to you, wrapped gently in cotton wool. Director Lulu Wang loosely adapts a chapter in her own life, as we follow a young woman (Awkwafina) travelling back to China to say goodbye to her terminally ill grandmother. Delving into all the intricacies of immigrant identity and family politics, it’s a comedy of warmth and bracing honesty. Clarisse LoughreyAn opportunity for Jordan Peele to cement his status as one of horror’s modern maestros, Us reels us in with old-fashioned thrills. Then it leaves us with the terrible dread of realising we’ve been looking into a mirror this whole time. Lupita Nyong\u0027o delivers two of this year’s best performances in one film, both as our hero and as her sinister doppelgänger – one of an army of “Tethereds” that emerge from underground seeking vengeance. Clarisse LoughreyAll of Pedro Almodovar’s films feel autobiographical in one way or another, but Pain \u0026amp Glory couldn’t be more lived-in if he stepped out in front of the camera to introduce every scene. A lushly romantic ode to cinema, shared history and cruelly interrupted love, it features a career-best performance from Antonio Banderas – Zorro at his most tender and vulnerable. Adam WhiteVox Lux is 2019’s most damning filmic portrait of American culture. We begin with a teenage girl (Raffey Cassidy), who survives a school shooting and ends up a pop star. As an adult, she’s played by a breezy, vicious Natalie Portman. Her strut is one part Sia, two parts Lady Gaga. It’s an ugly, despairing film that comes gift-wrapped in sequins, presenting art as the cavernous pit we throw our traumas into. Clarisse Loughrey620 15. Under the Silver LakeA paranoid puzzle box of a mystery, Under the Silver Lake is far more interested in the directions down the rabbit hole than allowing star Andrew Garfield to crawl his way out of it. That’s also the most pleasurable aspect of David Robert Mitchell’s film, a sunny LA noir which is sinister, hilarious and (potentially ruinously) male. It’s probably 2019’s most polarising film, adored and reviled in equal measure, but undeniably a work of striking creative autonomy. Adam WhiteHigh Life has its silly sub-Barbarella moments (Juliette Binoche testing out the spaceship’s very own orgasmatron machine) and clearly wasn’t made on a Hollywood budget. Nonetheless, veteran French auteur Claire Denis’s first English language film is a typically provocative and subversive affair. Binoche plays Dr Dibs, a scientist on board a ship full of criminals and trying to harvest healthy foetuses. Geoffrey MacnabAd Astra is a space movie with an Oedipal undertow. Brad Pitt gives a fine, understated performance as the introspective astronaut trying to save the world and find his father at the same time. Writer-director James Gray throws in references to Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now. This is a slow-moving but beguiling film with an unexpected emotional kick. Geoffrey Macnab920 12. Happy as LazzaroA bee keeper’s daughter, Italian director Alice Rohrwacher is one of European cinema’s visionary young talents. Happy As Lazzaro, her best film yet, is a magical realist fable that combines hard-hitting social comment about the exploitation of rural workers with flights of astonishing lyricism. The film also has one of the best performances of the year from newcomer Adriano Tardiolo, an 18-year-old economics student who plays the holy innocent, Lazzaro, with an ingenuousness which rekindles memories of Peter Sellers in Being There. Geoffrey MacnabBased on a Haruki Murakami’s short story, Burning – from South Korean maestro Lee Chang-dong – is a meditation on dealing with isolation and the tricks being alone might play on your memory. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) is forced to play detective when Steven Yeun’s affluent bachelor rolls into town – an event that coincides with the disappearance of a schoolfriend. Burning is a searing drama whose central unanswered mystery unnerves long after the credits role. Jacob StolworthyNews coverage has hardly been short of harrowing, violent footage of the Syrian Civil War. But too often missing are the human moments inbetween the bombings and the bloodshed. In Waad Al-Kateab’s first person account of the uprising’s aftermath, her camera’s gaze never flinches from the horrors it sees – as she and her husband try to maintain a rebel hospital amid a reign of bombing from President al-Assad – but nor does it stop rolling while she falls in love, has a baby, and jokes around with her friends and neighbours. This is the story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. It is an important, powerful, astonishing documentary. Alex PollardIt feels almost blasphemous to be glad of Julianne Moore stepping down from a role, but Lee Israel – the cantankerous, lonely literary forger who found herself the target of an FBI investigation in the Nineties – feels like a part Melissa McCarthy was born to play. Nimbly directed by Marielle Heller (who was shunned by the Oscars in the Best Director category), Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a sharp, funny and deeply compassionate examination of loneliness and self-destruction. Richard E Grant and Dolly Wells give wonderful supporting performances, too. Alex PollardAs deeply indebted to the teen movie genre as it is formally and narratively rebellious, Booksmart grounds its traditional night-before-graduation plot (teenagers eager to crash a party) in touching character-driven drama. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever, both instant stars, convey the ever-shifting dynamics and heightened dramas of adolescent best-friendship perfectly. Behind the camera, meanwhile, actor-turned-director Olivia Wilde demonstrates a staggering amount of emotional empathy and technical mastery for someone so green. Adam WhiteComparisons to Martin Scorsese’s previous films (Goodfellas, Casino) are unfounded considering The Irishman is unlike any other gangster film you’ll see. With his three-hour-30-minute-long opus, Scorsese places the harsh spotlight on mortality. Instead of tracking the rise of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) from regular family man to seasoned hitman with glitzy panache, we see him shamefully confess his crimes as an elderly man ruminating on his past in a nursing home. The result is an unsettlingly moving character study unafraid to ask the big questions.​Jacob Stolworthy1520 6. Once Upon a Time in HollywoodWith his ninth feature, Quentin Tarantino took a breath and crafted an unhurried, oddly heartwarming fable, one that came with a career-best performance from Brad Pitt. Its release rolled around with the usual smattering of discourse-steering controversy but, for all the complaints about the director’s depiction of his film star subjects, including the scant usage of Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the fact remains that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is one of the filmmaker’s most accomplished films – a free’n’easy sun-soaked delve into Sixties Hollywood, whose much-discussed final 20 minutes provided topics of conversation all summer long. Jacob StolworthyFor too many years the internet was exclusively evil in movies, something for tech boffins to hack, or used to steal Sandra Bullock’s identity. Bo Burnham’s Eighth Grade felt so comparatively real because it felt like the real internet, which has been as toxic and terrifying as it has been helpful to a generation of young people. Elsie Fisher, as a 13-year-old girl chronicling her confidence and anxieties in a vlog, is an adorable delight here, in a film that is devastatingly, heartbreakingly and endearingly human. Adam WhiteYorgos Lanthimos’s delightful, subversive vision has shaken the cobwebs out of costume drama. Set in the 18th century, it follows a trio of women – two cousins, Sarah (Rachel Weisz) and Abigail (Emma Stone), and the ruling Queen Anne (Olivia Colman) – as they vie for power over each other and England. Desire, savagery, and manipulative vulnerability all become weapons in the hands of those who have no choice but to fight dirty. But, then, Colman’s childless, gout-ridden Queen Anne tenderly reveals her shattered soul – it’s an Academy Award-winning performance that brings a slice of tragedy to an otherwise sublime farce. Clarisse LoughreyThe marriage of disparate talents united to ensure If Beale Street Could Talk is worthy of mention alongside Barry Jenkins’ previous film, Moonlight – The Independent’s film of the decade. With his film, Jenkins takes the words of James Baldwin and translates them into visual poetry. From Nicholas Britell’s mesmerising score to Regina King’s towering supporting performance (that Oscar was well deserved), the result is a creative tour de force. Jacob StolworthyHere is a love story about orce. Noah Baumbach writes and directs this aching, empathetic depiction of a couple whose marriage has fallen apart. As ruthless orce lawyers driving a wedge between two people already hanging by a thread, Ray Liotta and Laura Dern are magnificent, while Scarlett Johansson gives her best performance in years as a woman trying to do the right thing without knowing what that is. But the real star is Adam Driver, who – hulking as he is – makes himself seem small and fragile. For his rendition of Sondheim’s “Being Alive” alone, Marriage Story deserves all the awards coming its way. Alex PollardGreta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s 1868 novel – the story of four Massachusetts sisters coming of age during the American Civil War – may be a period piece, but there is nothing staid or stuffy about it. The girls, played by Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Emma Watson and Eliza Scanlen, talk and clamber over one another, their hair messy, their dresses scorched, their ambitions unfettered. It is a lively, profound adaptation. Alexandre Desplat provides the exuberant score, and Yorick La Saux’s cinematography is lush and textured. “I didn’t want it to be beautiful at the expense of being real,” said Gerwig. “But I did want it to feel like you wish you can jump inside and live in there or eat it. I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex Pollard120 20.

I remember trying to explain that to the gaffer, who was like, ‘You want what?’ I was like, ‘I want them to want to eat it.’” And how delicious it is. Alex PollardSpeaking on France’s RTL radio, festival organiser Thierry Fremaux said it wasn’t a political decision, but noted that black artists are underrepresented in the cinema world.Many of Lee’s films have been shown at Cannes, and his BlacKkKlansman won a major prize at Cannes two years ago.\u0026nbspThe rest of the jury members will be announced in April.Without explicitly mentioning Lee’s career-long fight against racism or other political views, the festival said Lee’s “perspective is more valuable than ever” and that “Cannes is a natural homeland and a global sounding board for those who (re)awaken minds and question our stances and fixed ideas”.Ladj Ly, whose film Les Miserables\u0026nbspechoes some of Lee’s work and tackles tensions between police and minorities in a poor Paris suburb, hailed the move by festival organisers. Les Miserables\u0026nbspscreened at Cannes last year and won an Oscar nomination Monday for best international film.The honorary president of French black rights group CRAN\u0026nbspalso welcomed Lee’s\u0026nbspappointment.“The arts world considers itself above questions of discrimination,” Louis-Georges Tin told The Associated Press. “But the #MeToo campaign showed that sexism is all too present in the arts world. And racism is too.”Tin expressed hope that Lee’s role in Cannes could prompt the French cinema world to take a hard look at how it treats minorities and France’s own colonial history. In French cinema, he said, “it’s always the blacks who make you laugh and Arabs who scare you”.Last year’s Cannes jury president was Mexican director Alejandro Inarritu, and the festival’s top prize went to Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite,\u0026nbspwho was nominated this week for Best International Film at the Oscars.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Labour wants to be part of making that change happen, we have to go back out into our communities and fight for it.”Chris Kitchen, the general secretary of the NUM, said: “Lisa Nandy is the leader Labour needs to rebuild the party and regain trust with the voters we’ve lost.“Our executive was pleased the contest has so many outstanding candidates.

I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatThe ballot simply asks members for a “yes” or “no” response to the question “should Momentum follow the NCG recommendation to endorse Rebecca Long-Bailey as the next leader of the Labour Party”. The same question is also asked of Ms Rayner for the deputy role.Michael Chessum, a Momentum member, who was on the steering committee of the group between 2016 and 2017, said: “Ludicrously, we only have one option for each position. This is a joke, and you should vote No on principle. Even if, like me, you might end up voting for one of the chosen candidates.”He\u0026nbsptold The Independent: “This entire situation is tragic and tell you a lot about what has happened to Corbynism. In 2015, we promised ‘a new kind of politics’ and to democratise the party, and Momentum was set up as a grassroots activist organisation.\u0026nbsp“But a strategy of command and control took over in the leader’s office, open selections was blocked, and Momentum had its internal democracy abolished in order to become a top-down mobilising vehicle. If we, the left, are not s of democracy, we will deserve to lose.”The journalist and Labour activist Owen Jones also criticised the process. “Momentum’s ruling body went for the worst of all worlds. They should have either said, look this is a representative democracy, you’ve elected to exercise our judgement, and accordingly we back Rebecca Long-Bailey and Angela Rayner, he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It undermines the candidates favoured by the leadership – they need the legitimacy of a democratic process.“No one believes Rebecca Long-Bailey would not win the democratic backing of the membership but it seems anything other than North Korean levels of grassroots support was deemed unacceptable by the leadership”.\u0026nbspWhen the organisation announced at the weekend it was endorsing the candidates at an executive level, Laura Parker, the group’s former national coordinator, who quit just after the general election, said: “Although I am pleased Momentum’s governing body accepted the principle of balloting its members on the leadership, I’m sorry they seem to have decided in advance what the answer is.”Lisa Nandy boosted by endorsement from National Union of MineworkersShe added: “Members should be able to choose from all leader and deputy candidates.”Momentum said they made the recommendation for Ms Long-Bailey on the basis “she is the only candidate committed to advancing the transformative agenda established by Jeremy Corbyn and furthering democratisation of the party”.\u0026nbspThe group added: “The NCG also voted to support Angela Rayner for the next deputy leader of the Labour Party. They believe she is the strongest candidate to work with Rebecca to help build a winning coalition within the Labour Party and wider society”.\u0026nbspThe ballot will run until midday on Thursday and if either question receives a “yes” vote from more than 50 per cent of those who cast a ballot, it “will pass and be adopted with immediate effect”, the group added.It will undoubtedly be a considerably boost for the candidate that eventually receives Momentum’s backing, given the group’s database of activists and experience of campaigning in Labour leadership contests and two general elections.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others can get it manually by going to Windows Update in the computer\u0027s settings.Microsoft typically releases security and other updates once a month and waited until Tuesday to disclose the flaw and the NSA\u0027s involvement. Microsoft and the NSA both declined to say when the agency notified the company.The agency shared the vulnerability with Microsoft quickly and responsibly, Neal Ziring, technical director of the NSA\u0027s cybersecurity directorate, said in a blog post Tuesday.Priscilla Moriuchi, who retired from the NSA in 2017 after running its East Asia and Pacific operations, said this is a good example of the constructive role that the NSA can play in improving global information security. Moriuchi, now an analyst at the U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future, said it\u0027s likely a reflection of changes made in 2017 to how the U.S. determines whether to disclose a major vulnerability or exploit it for intelligence purposes.The revamping of what\u0027s known as the Vulnerability Equities Process put more emphasis on disclosing unpatched vulnerabilities whenever possible to protect core internet systems and the U.S. economy and general public.Those changes happened after a group calling itself Shadow Brokers released a trove of high-level hacking tools stolen from the NSA.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me. The Queen has said she wants this sorted out and without delay.Many have called this an abdication and in one sense it is. Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this. So what’s changed their minds I’d love to be a fly on the wall of the events in that meeting . . . provided no one has a fly swat!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"see back of harry and meghan","story":"What a waste of the mountain of goodwill there was towards that happy, glamorous couple who wed on a sunshine-soaked day in Windsor in . And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are rich beyond the wildest dreams of almost everyone in the UK.They are more than capable of paying for a few bodyguards. Andthey find themselves struggling, they could always cut down on the private jets.The Queen, Charles and Wills must be firm: the Sussexes have made their bed. Now they’ve got to lie in it.A CIVILISED nation treats its veterans with respect.Which is why we were delighted when Boris Johnson won the election on a manesto promising to end witch hunt prosecutions against ageing former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland.But to get Stormont up and running, the Prime Minister has brokered a deal with Sinn Fein which risks opening up new probes into thousands of Troubles veterans. This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Daily Mail piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Trying again was full of anxiety that got worse when I fell pregnant for the third time.Happily that resulted in a healthy full term birth, but the first trimester was extremely stressful, for both myself and my husband.I struggled to keep perspective and flitted between wanting this baby more than anything  to wishing I would just bleed and get the awful thing over with and my le back.It was only after my son was born I realised the enormity of what I had been through, and the need to process it - there are support groups at my hospital now but there was nothing available to me at the time - so I wrote about it.Prof Bourne said while they used the questionnaire to identy PTSD, a formal clinical diagnosis would be needed to confirm it.However, he warned that the fact so many women were experiencing symptoms suggests many could be suffering in silence.Dr Jessica Farren, an obstetrician and gynaecologist who also worked on the study, said: Post-traumatic stress can have a toxic effect on all elements of a persons le - affecting work, home and relationships.We have made signicant progress in recent years in breaking the silence around mental health issues in pregnancy and post-natally.But early pregnancy losses are still shrouded in secrecy, with very little acknowledgement of how distressing and profound an event they are.Many women dont tell colleagues, friends or family they are pregnant before the -week scan, leaving them feeling unable to discuss their emotionsthey suffer a pregnancy loss.We also know partners can suffer psychological distress following miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, and are investigating this in ongoing research.The next step is to focus research on identying which women are at risk of psychological symptoms after pregnancy loss, the impact on partners and the best treatments.Jane Brewin, chief executive of Tommys said for too long women have not received the care they need after a miscarriage.This research just shows the scale of the problem, she said.Miscarriage services need to be changed to ensure they are available to everyone, and women are followed up to assess their mental wellbeing with support being offered to those who need it, and advice is routinely given to prepare for a subsequent pregnancy.The research, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, was funded by the Imperial Health Charity and the Imperial NIHR Biomedical Research Centre.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the first sighting of Meghan since the row over their plans to step down as frontline royals.She was escorted to the plane by a bodyguard. An airport source said: “She didn’t have to sit and wait with other passengers inside the terminal.”Meghan flew out as court documents filed at London’s High Couroutlined the extent of her fall out with dad Thomas Markle — and claimed she was behind a smear campaign against him.The documents have been filed by the Mail On Sunday as it fights a legal action bought by Meghan.They say intimate details of her broken relationship with Thomas, revealed in a US magazine by five “friends,” could only have come from her. They also accuse Meghan of scheming to use friends to pressure UK journalists into dropping stories about her.She is suing the newspaper for damages after it published a leaked letter she wrote to Thomas three months after her May  wedding. Meghan claims it was misuse of her private information and breach of .She could be forced to hand over private text messages, emails and phone records as part of the legal disclosure process. And she is likely to be called as a witnessthe case is not settled out of court.Her dad is said to be prepared to take the stand and testy against his own daughter in the bombshell case.The five-page handwritten letter was posted to Thomas by the Duchess of Sussex’s Los Angeles-based business manager.Thomas, a retired Hollywood lighting director, later said he decided to release parts of it after five “friends” of Meghan spoke anonymously about her relationship with him to US People magazine.In its detailed -page defence, the MoS said the February  People article hinted that Thomas had made “ claims” about his daughter and was “entirely at fault” for missing her wedding.One of the anonymous friends told People, which is read by million Americans: “It’s super-painful, because Meg was always so dutul. I think she will always feel genuinely devastated by what he’s done. And at the same time, because she’s his daughter, she has a lot of sympathy for him.”But the MoS says the information “could only have comefrom the claimant, not least because it presented events entirely from her perspective.It adds: “The People interview depicted Mr Markle as having acted unreasonably and unlovingly, having cold-shouldered his daughter, and being solely to blame for the estrangement. This was a one-sided and or misleading and  narrative.”The MoS says Meghan’s letter was an attack on Mr Markle, accusing him of “breaking her heart, manufacturing pain, being paranoid, fabricating stories, attacking Prince Harry and continually lying.”The documents also say frail Thomas, now , has still not met grandson Archie. And they allege he did not even receive a “get well soon” card from Meghan after emergency heart surgery.The documents state Thomas was taken into hospital in Mexico for surgery on May  — five days before Meghan’s wedding — and he texted her the same day to say he was unable to make the wedding.They state: “He told the Claimant he loved her and wished her the best. He sent a follow-up message asking who would ‘be giving her away’ and sayingshe really needed him he would come and that he was sorry ‘about all this’.”Thomas got a text response signed “Love M and H” but it read “asit was from Prince Harry”, the documents say.It is claimed the text set about “admonishing Mr Markle for talking to the press and telling him to stop — and accusing Mr Markle of causing hurt to his daughter. The text did not ask how the surgical procedure had gone or how Mr Markle was or send him good wishes.“Mr Markle was deeply hurt and responded with a curt message: ‘I’ve done nothing to hurt you Meghan or anyone . I’m sorry my heart attack is any inconvenience for you’.”It is claimed all texts and calls that Thomas made to Meghan after the May  wedding were ignored.The MoS says Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether People’s sources had cooperated at Meghan’s request.

For how much did they really know about each other before walking down the aisle Prince William apparently advised his more impetuous brother to wait so he could really get to know his American bride first, but Harry took umbrage and didn’t listen.Perhapshe had, he might have worked out in advance that an independent spirit joining such a restrictive institution wasn’t going to end well.Instead, they leapt before they looked and, with the “-month bride” having packed her bags already, have saddled the -year-old Queen with yet another constitutional crisis.Back in , I wrote a piece defending Meghan after she was criticised by old school friend Ninaki Priddy for being “calculated in the way she handled people and relationships” and a “curator of a beautul le”.But following the lavish baby shower, the jet-setting with A-listers and the swt jettisoning of inconveniently outspoken family members, the latter sentiment now rings true.And, of course, becoming a member of the most famous royal family in the world was the cherry on the top of that beautul le.But Meghan soon discovered it was nothing like the membership of her beloved Soho House.The rooms are draughty, the decor chintzy and, instead of reading the morning papers in your cashmere loungewear, you have to rise early, put on a frock and make your way to some rain-lashed outpost to open the new wing of a community centre where “live your best le” sentiments, however well-meaning, aren’t required.Here’s what is required as a member of the British Royal Family: Turn up on time, shake hands, smile, say little more than “have you come far ” Repeat.Not because the royals don’t have anything to say. They do, and air their views in private.But in public, their job is to shine a light on whatever project they’re visiting, not themselves. To show — via action, not virtue-signalling statements — a strong sense of duty.And inthey get to keep their ious mansions, hundreds of staff, personal bodyguards etc without any whf of civil unrest.That’s the deal.But those still in Meghan’s social circle glowingly describe her as organised, focused, and opinionated — very much an independent woman used to having her voice heard.As Prince Harry told courtiers just before their wedding: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”An admirable quality when it comes to breaking through the glass ceiling of corporate le or securing the best table in the best restaurant, perhaps.But the monarchy is an institution steeped in hundreds of years of tradition, and Meghan — who claimed she “didn’t know much” about Harry when they first met — clearly thought she’d mould it to her way of thinking . . . then rapidly discovered that it ain’t for turning.Not that The Queen didn’t try very hard to accommodate the wants and needs of the newly anointed Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Contrary to royal tradition, they were permitted to keep the christening of baby Archie as a private affair and, despite there being a perfectly nice home at Kensington Palace they could have used, a publicly funded, £.million renovation of Frogmore Cottage was authorised.A “cottage” I might add, that used to be five homes but has now been knocked in to one because they managed to dodge the usual ban that prevents such moves because of the UK’s housing crisis.Shortly after, Prince Charles launched his blueprint to try to solve the dilemma faced by millions of young people struggling to find a home of their own. Oh the irony. And after all that, they now want to use it part-time as they flit back and forth across the Atlantic.Meghan is feeling disillusioned and homesick. We get it, and sympathise.But let’s not pretend, as some claim, that she’s been practically pitchforked off this island by racist bigots.This is not a racist country and, besides, the British public initially greeted her engagement and later marriage to Harry with unbridled joy.We love Harry. He’s a thoroughly decent person and deserves particular praise for the work he’s done with the Armed Forces, both while serving and afterwards.No, the disconnect has come from the fact that Meghan is still a Hollywood celebrity at heart and, consequently, never truly settled in her often boring and restrictive new role.She misses the relative freedom of her old le, not to mention her family and friends.Again, we get it. But was it really necessary to flee these shores asescaping for her le Clearly besotted with her, Harry faces the stark decision of giving her what she wants or losing her for ever. Or perhaps he’s genuinely sick of royal le and wants out too.If so, let’s wave goodbye and wish them luck.But. The have-cake-and-eat-it plan to stop being a “senior royal” and just dip in and out of duties that suit them simply isn’t going to work.SussexRoyal — which Harry and Meghan have registered as an official trademark for everything from “emotional support services” to clothing and magazines — is a title and privilege that comes with duties and conditions attached, not a brand, be it charitable or otherwise.The future of the monarchy depends on the goodwill, support and interest level of the public, and a recent survey showed that, while the majority have no issue with their decision to go, they were strongly against any continued taxpayer funding of their lavish lestyle.So— as early indicators go — The Queen allows Harry and Meghan to call the shots while keeping their royal titles, their taxpayer-funded security and an allowance from the Duchy of Cornwall, then one suspects this will be discussed by students for centuries to come as the turning point at which the British monarchy began its steady decline to irrelevance and, ultimately, abolition.MOVIE mega-star Will Smith popped in to the retirement party of a woman he last met  years ago.Anita Scipio was the receptionist at a US radio station when Will arrived for one of his first interviews as a young actor and he’s never forgotten how nice she was to him.“My favorite moments on the road are the ones where I can connect with people like @anitascipio,” -year-old Will told his Instagram followers before he walked in to the station to give her a hug.In the days before social media, someone who worked at his record company Sony told me that whenever he was in town, Will would tour the building, from post room to boardroom, giving time to everyone.He’s that rare creature, a star on screen and off.Some of today’s petulant slebs should watch and learn.FORMER psychiatric nurse Susan Evans is launching a landmark legal case to challenge consent issues around the provision of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for under-s.She argues that children should be protected from “experimental” and “invasive medical treatment”, not least because “some children are referred despite having autism, being homosexual or suffering some form of trauma or sexual abuse”.Speaking on Radio , she added that children as young as nine were being asked to consent “to a completely experimental treatment for which long-term consequences are not known”.But gender ersity advocates warn that “a loss to trans youth is a loss to all”.Time will tell the outcome of her case but, meanwhile, in unrelated comments, I note that the actor Rupert Everett says he spent most of his early childhood wanting “to be a girl”.He adored his mother, aunt and grandmother, didn’t like men, and adds: “I loved necklaces and bras and all those kinds of things.”Then, when he reached , he “didn’t want to be a girl any more. I really enjoyed being a homosexual”.The case in point, perhaps, for treading very carefully indeed with pre-teens.POLICE officers will be required to have degrees from this year – a move that could remove , recruits from the front line while they complete their studies.Sigh.

While I have bought several mobile phones, I have never gone shopping for an entire telecoms network.But surely there must be other potential contractors. Don’t we have a telecoms industry of our own It doesn’t say much for the Government’s privatisation of BTit is not in the running for this sort of work.What about our own Vodafone, which I thought was one of the world leaders in mobile phone technology Evendepriving Huawei of the work meant we had to wait a little longer or pay a little extra to download a movie to our phones, that would surely be a reasonable price to pay for protecting national security.And national security policy really is at stake.Yesterday the US reaffirmed that allowing Huawei to build our G network — even parts of it which are deemed to be low- risk — would be “madness” and could compromise the willingness of the US to share vital intelligence with Britain in future.This didn’t come in one of Donald Trump’s notorious am tweets but from officials working for Matt Pottinger, the US deputy national security adviser, and Robert Blair, special representative for international telecommunications policy.That they took the trouble to visit London to warn of the dangers we could be getting ourselves into ought to be seen as a red flag on Huawei’s involvement in our G network.Surely, the importance of being able to share intelligence with our most important ally should rank above pure considerations of cost.Australia has already blocked the Chinese firm from its G network.Yet here, the head of MI Sir Andrew Parker said he had “no reason” to think Britain’s intelligence partnership with the US would sufferinvolvement from the Chinese firm was given the green light.But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace underlined at the weekend that the US administration has threatened to cut off some intelligenceBritain approves Huawei’s involvement in G.He said: “Those things will be taken into account when the Government collectively decides to make a decision on it.”Our own Government — as it has been doing since Theresa May’s day — insists that only parts of the G contract would be awarded to Huawei.It would not be allowed to work on security-critical areas.But that isn’t good enough. Such is the complexity of modern telecommunications networks that it would be impossible to be sure that systems installed in one part of the network were not enabling data to be obtained from another.Whoever designs and builds a telecommunications system gains the power to interfere with it, or even switch it off, should it feel inclined.Of course, with modern communications a huge amount of damage can be done from afar.Evenwe are confident our broadband network is secure now, we can’t be certain that would remain the case.A company which installs a telecommunications network will necessarily continue to be involved in maintaining and upgrading the network it had designed and installed.We have to be absolutely sure the network is not being used for some underhand purpose.Huawei denies that it is controlled by the Chinese state, and has threatened to sue commentators in France whom it alleges have made that claim.But the precise relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state is hardly the point.What is certain is that China is not a democracy and there is always going to be a security issue when it comes to involving its industrial giants in sensitive work here.We would not allow a Chinese company, say, to build fighter jets for the RAF or to construct our radar defence system.This kind of work is rightly the preserve of contractors on whom we can rely totally, even in times of international conflict.Such is the importance of telecommunications in military and civil defence that we now have to think of mobile networks in the same light.The Government has been warning for years that cyber warfare is the big coming threat.In  it published a Strategic Defence Review which defined cyber attack as a “Tier One” threat alongside terrorism.Last November, the US and Taiwanese held a joint exercise in fending off a major cyber attack on Taiwan.At the time the Taiwanese Cyber Security Agency said it was the subject of an astonishing million cyber attacks every month, half of which came from the Chinese mainland.So why, then, is our own Government even considering commissioning a Chinese company to install a telecommunications network Of course, Boris Johnson is right to make it clear he is not Donald Trump’s poodle.We don’t have to take notice of everything the Americans say, on defence, trade or anything .But when it comes to our closest ally warning us that it might not want to share intelligence with us in futurewe let a Chinese company build our G network, we very much do need to take notice.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

believe it” when his viewing was abruptly cancelled because of his ethnicity.He said: “I was completely shocked at the landlord’s response and I still am today.“Growing up in England, I’ve experienced all types of racism, but this was the first time that I’ve experienced something this absurd.“What makes it even more shocking is the fact she said ‘will be brilliantyou can make the time to come and view’, but soon changed her mind once she realised I was black.“I wasn’t expecting her to even ask me about my background as I didn’t think it was relevant and she even had the nerve to say it wasn’t racist.Mr Mboob added how the ordeal has left him feeling self-conscious when cooking African food in case other people have the same perception.“She even tried to play it down by saying how she has Nigerian friends and that all their houses smell like what they cook,” he concluded.“I’ve just moved in with new housemates and I’ve developed serious anxiety about cooking around them in case they hate the smell too.”Ms Vimbsone declined to comment when approached by The Sun Online.Under the Race Relations Act it is unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against a tenant on racial grounds.The Act defines racial grounds as including race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins.According to the Race Relations Act, there are four main types of racial discrimination: direct, indirect, victimisation and harassment.Direct racial discrimination takes place when you are able to show that you have been treated less favorably on racial grounds than others in a comparable situation.It occurs when:Refusing to rent or let a property based on race is unlawful as it breaches section  of the Equality Act .In , Fergus Wilson – Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlord – banned

William and Harryaposs statement said: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful. With Harry and Meghan looking to split their time between Britain and North America, it is unclear how much time Archie will actually get with his cousins in the foreseeable future.

The Sun reports that the Cambridges opted to meet baby Archie for the first time alone, leaving their children at home. It has been said Meghan and little Prince Louis appeared to hit it off during the polo match in July. But with the Sussexes alleged to have been discussing the possibility of quitting public le as early as May last year, they chose to spend Christmas in Vancouver, far away from Sandringham with the other royals, as per tradition.  And just days after arriving back in the UK they announced they would be stepping back from senior royal le with the intention of becoming financially independent. Harry is due to host the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace on Thursday before he is expected to jet back over to his we and child. The duke arrived two hours before the crunch meeting at the Sandringham estate to have a heart-to-heart with the Queen alone.  The -year-old monarch was said to be bitterly disappointed by the Sussexesapos desire to step back from public le while splitting their time between the UK and North America. Following their chat and a discussion with the three princes afterwards, Her Majesty gave her blessing for a transitional period. Her Majesty had been desperate for her grandson and his new we to remain full-time working members of the firm, an official statement said last night, but has now relented. She is said to want the problem resolved in days rather than weeks but has admitted producing a workable plan for the Sussexesapos desired financial independence has proved complex with details still being ironed out.

Social media critics claimed bi-racial Meghan was not pure enough to marry into the Firm. The inference has always been that she doesn’t belong. She has been derided as a a, intent on wrecking the Royal Family. The so-called “constitutional crisis” is Harry and Meghan fighting back.  They are young people who want to go their own way. Millions of families have them. Kids who decide they want no part of the way things have been done in the past, children of rock stars who aren’t interested in music, footballers’ kids who don’t like sport. Frankly, the Sussexes are right to put themselves and their own wellbeing first. Of course, Home Secretary Priti Patel can’t see the problem. She serves under a Prime Minister whose overt racism is well documented. This debate, however, could yet become a turning point for our media. Most of the royal commentators stamping their feet over this are white. Most of the newsrooms covering this are largely white. The real time backlash is from black Britons with a digital  who are determined to have their say.  Angry, polarised race-baiting for social media hits is not the answer. The solution is a better ethnic mix in our media to give us an understanding of how to address this issue. Royal Author Penny Junor was left stumped on CBS This Morning when she vehemently insisted race was not a factor in Meghan’s treatment. “Did you check in with any black Britons before you made that determination ” asked the presenter. Junor was left stuttering. It appeared she hadn’t. All Meghan has done is back her husband as he chooses to move out of his grandmother’s house and fend for himself.

Emily Evans-Schreiber, , from Naseby, Northamptonshire was caught out after her own mother became suspicious of her designer clothes, international trips, beauty treatments and five-star hotels. Northampton Crown Court heard how she made  transactions totalling £, between April and December . Evans-Schreiber pleaded guilty to theft and was given a suspended prison sentence of two-years, along with  hours of unpaid work and an alcohol treatment programme. The mum-of-one only had £ in her bank account when she was asked to help care for her -year-old grandmother Rosina Evans who was terminally ill with dementia. Evans-Schreiber was put in charge of her grandmotheraposs finances after her family became concerned about her lestyle in London and tasked her with caring for her grandma in April . Eight months later, her mother, Clare, called the bank and police concerned over how her jobless daughter was able to fund her jet set lestyle. By this point, only £, remained in her grandmotheraposs account.When police raided Evans-Schreiberaposs house they found designer clothing, shoes, handbags and sunglasses. The bank statements for her grandmotheraposs account to Evans-Schreiberaposs were labelled as bills, care and savings. Her grandmother - who has now passed away - never knew of the theft. The former model - who worked for  Cara Delevigne and her sister Poppy in  - also handed over around £, to the father of her now eight-year-old daughter, Sam Oguche.  The defense argued that Evans-Schreiber left enough cash to pay for her grandmotheraposs medical costs and did consider her needs. Carolina Guiloff told the court: Sheaposs had  years of a blame-free le. She was out of control and wasnapost in her normal mental state. It would be wrong for your honour to be left with the impression that this was a cold and callous woman who had no regard for her grandmother at all.

The couple want to be internationally protected people as they step back from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family, splitting their time between North America and the UK. Their security is currently funded by the tax payer but there are questions as to how this would continue in their new positions.According to The Times , Scotland Yard is already struggling to train enough specialist officers to cope with the increasing demands of the Royal Family.A source told the newspaper that the couple have not thought out the security implications of their move and have put the Met in an impossible position. A top American bodyguard who is nicknamed the Secret Service of Hollywood has estimated that the cost of protecting the couple privately could be an eye-watering million, which is about £.million.Russell Stuart, who founded Force Protection Agency, told DailyMail the couple would need between two and four guards between them at all times and people watching each of their homes at all times. He told the site: Eventhey become private citizens the idea that they could pop to the grocery store - that is probably never going to happen. There are two of the most famous people on the planet. Because of that running their security detail comes with an incredible amount of pressure and its own set of additional problems. And they will need security now more than ever. There are a lot of bad people in the world. Any transitional period would offer them an opportunity.  Their security bill has still to be managed, set between £, and £million, considerably moreiding their time between countries. It was one of the six points discussed at crisis talks between the Queen, Harry, Charles and William at Sandringham yesterday. The Queen and other royals have vowed to find a “workable approach” to the issue. There were reports today that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has agreed to foot the bill.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailJust one week ago a post-Christmas calm had descended on Sandringham House. Most of the family had headed home, Prince Philip was on the mend and the outrage over Prince Andrew’s friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein appeared to be dying down. So the Queen was looking forward to spending the rest of her Norfolk stay riding, walking her corgis and enjoying the outdoors. It was business as usual at the heart of The Firm. But on Wednesday evening, as the Queen was dressing for dinner, another of her grandsons pulled the trigger on a crisis that would rock the institution to its very core. The sovereign and her two heirs Charles and William were ambushed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who announced they wanted to retreat from royal duties. Unhappy Harry and Meghan had been plotting to escape for more than  months and sealed their plan on a week’s break in Canada. In December, the Queen and Prince Charles urged the pair to hold their fire and submit detailed, written proposals before going public. But the renegade royals defied the -year-old monarch by firing off their extraordinary statement announcing they were stepping back from royal duties. The Queen knew instantly the shockwaves from this bombshell would be seismic for The Firm. For such senior royals to break away from the family, but with the intention to still cash-in on their HRH status, was unprecedented. And she feared the public, on whose devotion the survival of the monarchy relies, would never stand for it. That statement was the first shot in an extraordinary battle of briefings and counter briefings with the Sussexes’ advisors pitched against the Palace, the Prince of Wales’ aides and the Cambridges’ camp. It quickly developed into a war of attrition that revealed the true levels of toxicity between Harry and his once-close brother William. The Queen was forced to summons an unprecedented family summit to find a way forward for the Sussexes. Opinion polls in the wake of this “abdication bombshell” reveal young people now see the institution as irrelevant and anachronistic.  Yet the royals they admire and identy with are the former wild-child army hero and his actress and humanitarian we. One royal source said: “Harry and Meghan had known for some time that they were not part of the main plans and had to reconcile with that. “When the photo was released of the Queen with Charles, William and George at New Year, they didn’t so much mind the picture, it was the attention that came with it. “They knew where their place was, but couldn’t stop the obvious optics, that it was proof that they would be very much on the outside of the family... “Charles had spoken to Meghan personally on several occasions, their relationship was great from the start. He thought she was gutsy, talented and charming – and still does.  “The Queen, William and Charles are deeply hurt about the way the pair behaved, and forced them into this damaging crisis, but they know they cannot lose them.” The tension in the air before that Long Library summit at Sandringham, on Monday, proved everyone there understood its historic signicance. But what about the Duchess of Sussex, , miles away in Canada  She must have understood this was a watershed moment for the British monarchy and not just a matter for her and her husband.  Because, while it may be just  months since she joined The Firm, Meghan has had plenty of time to learn how it operates. Harry would have left her in no doubt the steps they were taking were set to cause royal ructions. We know now that the seeds of this crisis were sewn within months of the couple’s wedding in May . Meghan faced scrutiny of the way she cut ties with her father, alleged tensions with staff members and her lavish baby-shower in New York.  Harry was accused of eco-hypocrisy after urging us to help save the planet, while jetting off on private planes. But, scarred by his mother’s death and desperate to protect his we, he felt Meghan was being bullied and  vilied – and subject to racism. The pair became so blinded by their dissatisfaction and sense of victimisation, they seemingly failed to consider the hurt this would cause Harry’s loving grandmother. They secretly began setting up a rival website – Sussex Royal – and trademarking more than  items.  They reportedly started investigating mega-bucks endorsement deals, said to be helped by their billionaire pal Oprah Winfrey. A video has emerged of Harry touting for business with the Disney CEO Bob Iger at a film premier – offering Meghan’s services as a voice-over artist. That deal has apparently already been sealed, with one of the Sussexes’ animal charities profiting. Experts predict that Brand Sussex – the ultimate celebrity couple – could make half a billion pounds in just one year. But the couple’s unhappiness only became publicly apparent during a tour of South Africa in October.  Meghan told ITV’s Tom Bradby she was “not really OK” and it was not enough “just to survive” – while Harry seemed to confirm a rt with his brother. In November, the Sussexes embarked on their six-month sabbatical in Canada with baby Archie. Then, last month, Harry told his father some of his plans, prompting calls for detailed proposals to put before Her Majesty. Harry arranged to see the Queen on histo the UK. But when he and Megan flew home on Monday, he learned she was “not available after all” and was told to wait and discuss matters with Charles. Then, on Wednesday, came reports that Harry and Meghan were looking to move to Canada “for a signicant portion of the year”. So Harry decided to defy his grandmother and issue the bombshell statement. And then all hell broke loose.

Ex-England cricket captain David Gower, , said: “Unregulated trophy hunting adds extra pressure to vulnerable species. It is unethical and unnecessary.” Many hunters show off their kills in sickening photos. It includes Brittany Longoria, from the US, who posed in  alongside a dead leopard in Namibia.

Police issued Nolan with a  warning about his bizarre conduct - but he was later convicted of harassment between  and . This week the widower, who is partially sighted, was convicted of breaching a restraining order which had banned him from contacting the victim.She made a statement against Nolan, but died last year before the case could came to court, reports the Manchester Evening News .In her statement read to Tameside Magistratesapos Court, Miss Holdich who lived with her husband Steven said: aposaposOver a long period of time I have been targeted by our neighbour Mr Nolan. aposaposOver the years have had to put up with all sorts of abuse including Mr Nolan taking pictures of me.  I live in a row of terrace houses ours being the end but for some reason Mr Nolan tried to claim the land at the rear of the houses which included land that Steven and I own. aposaposHe has targeted me but never it appears Steven. I was successful in gaining a court order to protect me from harassment and as a result I finally felt after years of being a victim I could now live in peace. aposaposI underwent a double mastectomy and due to the procedure was hospitalised there for a week. But when I ed home then my husband made me aware he had had an incident with Mr Nolan and I felt upset, I thought that the harassment was starting again.aposapos The court heard the campaign arose out a civil dispute Nolan was waging against Mrs Holdich over a strip of land which had aposaposoverlappedaposapos onto his property from her back garden.  Whenever she went out for walks with her dogs, he would take photographs of her. It was claimed he was verbally abusive towards Miss Holdich shouting and swearing at her and at one stage he did threaten to kill her. He was given a two year restraining order in January  after being convicted of harassment but was questioned by police again after an incident the following April in which he was seen gesturing at her from a window. Mrs Holdichaposs statement added: aposapos We have two dogs and I love getting out and taking them for a walk.  Due to the operation I felt cooped up and on this day felt fine and in the position to go for a small walk and it was a big event for me after the surgery and post op treatment. aposaposAs I ed I was feeling great and felt I was winning my battle and saw Steven at the fence.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle were forced to remove a line from their new website claiming they are internationally protected people entitled to personal security whenever they want. One of the key points of discussion at Mondayaposs crisis summit at Sandringham was the Sussexesapos annual security bill, which is understood to be paid for by the taxpayer. The couple, who fled to Vancouver for a six-week Christmas hiatus, announced last week they intended to give up public le and step down as senior royals. But with Harry, Meghan and little Archie planning to split their time between Britain and North America as they look to become financially independent, it is unclear how their body guards will be paid for. Launched last Wednesday, the rebellious duke and duchessapos new official website Sussexroyal contained the controversial phrasing about their entitlement.But this was deleted in a matter of hours of it going live, reports the Mail Online .The publication said legal expert Dai Davies, a former chief superintendent who led the Metaposs royalty protection unit, said naivety beggars belief.  He said they were mistaken to presume they should have round-the-clock protection when they are no longer senior royals. I have never heard of the phrase aposaposinternationally protected peopleapos, he continued. As far as I can see there is no such thing when you are no longer performing royal duties. The coupleaposs new website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million.  And with their intention to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, it is understood Prince Charles made it clear he does not have unlimited funds. Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, as well as fitting out Frogmore cottage, all cost millions and it is unclear how far the Prince of Wales is willing to bank roll the pair. Any future funding is likely to impose firm rules on their commercial ventures, with the couple expected to look to make millions abroad.  Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said thereaposs still much to discuss over the Sussexesapos proposed move to Canada. The Sussexesapos desire to move has raised questions over the costs of the coupleaposs security during their time in North America and who would foot the bill. Asked during an interview with Global News on Monday whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay, Mr Trudeau said: That is part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on.  Weaposre not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, what the dispositions are and those are decisions for them. I think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have. He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved up until this point about what the coupleaposs move to the country will involve.  There are still a lot of decisions to be taken by the royal family, by the Sussexes themselves, as to what level of engagement they choose to have, Mr Trudeau said. We are obviously supportive of their reflections but have responsibilities in that as well. The Sussexes enjoyed a general feeling of appreciation in Canada, he added. Meghan was seen in public this week for the first time since the bombshell announcement, as she boarded a seaplane from Vancouver Island.

The formalities were out of the way and the evening reception at Frogmore House would begin. The Duchess changed into a stunning Stella McCartney evening gown, and wore an aquamarine ring from the private collection of Princess Diana, while her handsome husband swapped his military unorm for a smart tuxedo. Although the evening affair, like their honeymoon destination, was kept quiet, their Christmas cards later that year showed the two watching fireworks on the grounds that night. But who could have predicted the fireworks that would blow everything out of water just  months later  “Few,any, could have foreseen just how bad things could get” said a royal source. “That the very essence of the monarchy could be threatened in such a way so soon.” It certainly did not take long for the honeymoon period to come to an end for the couple. In October , after a jet-setting summer, they embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over  days.It was there they shared their good news that another royal baby was on its way with the world.  Tongues had already been set wagging after the Duchess had covered up her dress at Princess Eugenie’s wedding with a loose fitting coat, even keeping it buttoned up during the service. But when the news was confirmed the world could not contain their excitement. An insider said at the time: “Harry will bring her tea and breakfast in bed. “They go over their schedule and then take a stroll in the gardens before Meghan does her daily prenatal yoga.” Becoming a father was something Harry had longed for since he was young, and like many fathers-to-be, he was concerned about the world that his child would grow up in.  In his speech at a round table discussion with Commonwealth young leaders, he said: “As someone who is about to become a father, I am acutely aware of our shared responsibility to make this world more resilient and its inhabitants more accountable for the next generation. “The only way to see real progress is not by chance, it’s by change.” Meghan declared her husband was “going to be the best dad”. And nobody could deny that it was a role he was born to do.  And on May , , the world rejoiced when it was announced that Meghan had given birth to a baby boy at the exclusive Portland Hospital in London, weighing lbs oz. Harry had been by his we’s side during the labour, and was reported as saying, the “little thing is absolutely to die for”. But we had to wait another two days before we were introduced to their bundle of joy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. Archie was a tribute to the army hero and Duke’s mentor, who had got him deployed in Afghanistan, while Harrison was a tribute to Meghan’s “favourite Beatle”. The couple then held a photo call in St George’s Hall at Windsor Castle. Hearts melted as Harry carried Archie to the waiting press, looking every inch the proud father.  When asked what motherhood was like, Meghan replied: “It’s pretty amazing. I have the two best guys in the world so I’m really happy. He has the sweetest temperament.” To this, Harry teased: “I don’t know who he gets that from.” Meghan said Archie had been “the dream,” with them having a “special couple of days”. Prince Harry could not hide his delight, adding: “Parenting is amazing.“It’s only been what, two and a half, three days, but we’re just so thrilled to have our own little bundle of joy. We have to spend some precious time with him as he starts to grow up. I’m so incredibly proud of my we.”  When it came to royal duties, the couple threw themselves into charity work, but soon the pressures of royal le became increasingly apparent. Another insider said: “In Meghan, Harry thought – they both thought in fact – she would be the one to take on all-consuming and demanding Royal duties under close scrutiny by senior Royals, Palace courtiers and the public – but the cracks had started to appear.” A documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September, showed the strain Meghan felt she was under. “Not many people have askedI’m OK,” Meghan said.  She spoke of her vulnerability during the pregnancy and the challenges of having a newborn baby. “It’s a lot,” she said. And when askedshe could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive – “that’s not the point of le – you have got to thrive”. The following month, Harry broke down while talking about his we and son during a fundraising event for a charity which serves seriously ill children. “Last year when my we and I attended we knew we were expecting our first child. No one  knew at the time, but we did,” he said, before lowering his head to collect himself. “And now as parents, being here and speaking to all of you, pulls at my heartstrings in a way I could never have understood until I had a child.”  But the writing may have been on the wall much longer. A royal source added: “Arguably the signs were there as far back as June last year when Harry and Meghan announced they would set up their own charitable foundation, splitting from the Royal Foundation and Prince William and Kate Middleton. “The split was part of their wider plans it would seem, to launch a brand based vehicle to work across their charitable endeavours. “But it certainly marked the final step in the ision of the two couples’ public duties and indeed, it would seem now, the beginning of the end of their personal relationships.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle beams pops tea","story":"NewsMeghan Markle beams as she pops in for tea with women at crisis centreThe duchess visited the Downtown Eastside Womens Centre in Vancouver in her second appearance since leaving the UKShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-joined-mother-doria-kensington-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-beams-pops-tea-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Prince Charles and Prince William have told the Queen they will take the reins after she brokered a peace deal to allow the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to quit their roles. William on Tuesday carried out ­investitures on behalf of the monarch, including a knighthood for former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will expand their work in climate change and early years development, and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders in Israel and Palestine next week. Round-the-clock discussions continue to find “workable solutions” to allow the Sussexes to split their le between Canada and the UK.Courtiers hope the renewed focus will assist the family and their senior aides to forge new ideas alongside plans being thrashed out to help the couple leave the family set-up. It is understood discussions will determine what role the couple will have with UK charities they have been involved in. The Queen said in her unprecedented statement this week how the issues were “complex matters for my family to resolve”. Despite the -year-old monarch suggesting solutions would be “reached in the coming days”, the Mirror understands “deep concerns” have emerged at ­organisations where the Sussexes hold patronages. Last year they carried out around  engagements but insiders fear grassroots organisations will sufferthey are part-time royals. One senior official at the National Theatre told how there is anger that Meghan visited director Rufus Norris and executive director Lisa Burger in London last Wednesday, hours before the announcement she and Harry would be “stepping back” from royal duties. Meghan “carried on aseverything was completely normal” and gave no indication she would put in jeopardy the patronage given to her by the Queen last January after holding the role for  years. One well-placed source said: “It’s fair to say there is a lot of worry about whether the Duchess will stick around after failing to tell theatre bosses of her intentions, which were published on social media hours after her meeting. “She was seen as the perfect advertisement, she appeals to a cross section of ages and genders and it was hoped she would be a real force for change in the industry. We hope she doesn’t abandon us.” A spokeswoman for the National Theatre said they had held “very positive discussions about the NT’s upcoming activity and opportunities for the Duchess to engage with the work over the coming year”. Harry is royal patron of  organisations while Meghan has four, including the ­Association of Commonwealth Universities, which the Queen held for  years.  The Duchess also took on patronage of animal charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps unemployed women and for which she designed a collection of clothes. Harry and Meghan are understood to have not ed clear verdicts to the royal family on how long they intend to spend in each country. Speculation is mounting they could lose or renounce their royal titles after the Queen referred to them by their first names in her historic statement.

In October, The Duchess of Sussex took legal action against the Mail on Sunday over its decision to publish a highly personal letter which she penned for her dad. But the estranged father and daughter appear to be on a collision course after reports that the newspaper signed up Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle, as its star witness. The Mail on Sunday will argue there is a huge public interest in the personal relationships of members of the royal family as part of its defence, court documents show The newspaper also says royals rely on publicity about themselves and their lives to maintain the privileged positions they hold. In February, the Mail on Sunday published extracts of Meghanaposs handwritten letter to her estranged father Thomas Markle. In one extract, published by the newspaper, the duchess wrote: Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces - not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand. Meghanaposs lawyers filed a High Court claim against the paper and its parent company Associated Newspapers over the alleged misuse of private information. But in its legal defence the paper claims the duchess did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy that the contents of the letter were private and would remain so, according to the BBC.  It comes just  hours after the Queen agreed Harry and Meghan could step back as senior royals and begin a new le as an independent family. Buckingham Palace also confirmed the Sussexes would begin a transition period in which they would split their time between the UK and Canada, where the Duchess is currently with their son Archie. Mr Markle was caught up in controversy in the build-up to the  wedding after he allegedly staged paparazzi photographs of himself and then began commenting regularly to entertainment website TMZ about his contact with his daughter.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Meghan Markle was seen for the first time since the shock announcement she and Prince Harry will step down as senior royals last week.The Duchess of Sussex was photographed arriving at a seaboat on Vancouver Island to fly to the mainland in Canada after leaving a million waterside mansion where the couple stayed during the festive season. In photos seen by the Mirror, the royal was wearing a large fur-lined olive green coat, covering much of her face, as well as large brown snow boots and tight-fitted jeans. Meghan is shown smiling and talking to her members of security as she walks towards the Whistlers Air seaplane. But the coupleaposs son baby Archie was nowhere to be seen. The former Hollywood actress fled to Canada with eight-month-old Archie with members of her security after news broke that the couple planned to retire as senior royals. After Prince Harry and Meghan released the bombshell statement saying they would be stepping back as senior royals, the family scrambled to organise a summit to negotiating the future of the monarchy. During the two-hour crisis summit at Sandringham House on Monday, the Queen gave her blessing to the couple, allowing a transitional period while all the details are ironed out. Initially it was reported Meghan had been barred from the talks, before it was suggested she may have been involved towards the end, due to the dficulties surrounding the time dference.  However, a spokesman for the couple has now said: In the end, the Sussexes decided that it wasnapost necessary for the Duchess to join. Harry had arrived early in order to speak privately with his grandmother and put his side across. The -year-old monarch was said to be bitterly disappointed by the Sussexesapos desire to step back from public le while splitting their time between the UK and North America. But the crunch talks which followed with Princes Charles and William saw the Queen order their teams to find a workable solution over the future role of Harry and Meghan within the Royal Family.  A Buckingham Palace Source said the senior royals have asked aides to work at pace with the Government and The Sussex Household and an outcome was expected to take days, not weeks. Her Majesty had been desperate for her grandson and his new we to remain full-time working members of the firm, an official statement on Monday evening said, but has now relented. She admitted producing a workable plan for the Sussexesapos desired financial independence has proved complex with details still being ironed out.  The coupleaposs new website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million. And with their intention to relinquish the Sovereign Grant, it is understood Prince Charles made it clear he does not have unlimited funds. Harry and Meghanaposs wedding, as well as fitting out Frogmore cottage, all cost millions and it is unclear how far the Prince of Wales is willing to bank roll the pair.  Any future funding is likely to impose firm rules on their commercial ventures, with the couple expected to look to make millions abroad. In the Queenaposs landmark statement sanctioning their new le, the monarch refers to the couple not at first by their official titles. Instead, with an unusual degree of informality for the monarch, she calls them Harry and Meghan, only later on in the statement referring to them as the Sussexes.  This has been taken as a clue as to what might be in store, with commentators questioning whether there is the prospect of the couple losing their HRH style and even their royal titles. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said thereaposs still much to discuss over the Sussexesapos proposed move to Canada. The Sussexesapos desire to move has raised questions over the costs of the coupleaposs security during their time in North America and who would foot the bill.  Asked during an interview with Global News on Monday whether Canadian taxpayers would have to pay, Mr Trudeau said: That is part of the reflection that needs to be had and there are discussions going on. Weaposre not entirely sure what the final decisions will be, what the dispositions are and those are decisions for them.  I think most Canadians are very supportive of having royals be here, but how that looks and what kind of costs are involved, there are still lots of discussions to have. He said the federal Canadian government had not been involved up until this point about what the coupleaposs move to the country will involve.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA neglected seven-year-old boy was found living in a home that resembled a rubbish tip, alongside his drug addict parents. The home was found littered with heroin needles, rotting food and infestations of flies when social services and the police arrived. Leicester Crown Court heard the youngster had vanished off the local authorityaposs radar after moving schools - despite not showing up to school for six months, reports Leicestershire Live. Alexander Wolfson, prosecuting, said there was a multi-agency meeting in December , before the police attended an address in Leicester and found it to be in absolute squalor. He said: The conditions were disgusting, with rotting food and piles of rubbish everywhere. The bedrooms, lounge and bathroom were filthy. The kitchen was rancid with a couple of tins of food left open and evidence of mouse droppings. The stove was inaccessible, there was mouldy food in the fridge and it was dficult to move around. Unfortunately drugs paraphernalia was lying about items associated with taking heroin, with uncapped needles. Cigarette ash was evident and flies. Bags of rubbish were on the upstairs landing. When a drawer in the boyaposs bedroom cupboard was opened a cloud of flies flew into the air, said the prosecutor. He added: There were faeces marks across a wall. The toilet was filthy with no evidence of a toothbrush or toothpaste in the bathroom. The child didnapost appear to have a change of clothes and didnapost have pyjamas. He was not wearing underwear or socks. He did not appear to have toys fit to play with. The boy told officers he had eaten some cookies during the day, but did not appear to have had anything . The foster parents he was placed with reported that he did not want to wash, brush his teeth or have his hair washed and was terried of flies. He was always hungry and had dficulty understanding the dference between day and night. He had not been registered with a GP and needed medication for worms.  The child was placed in school and assessed as being two years behind. However, he did not appear to be malnourished or to have any other medical issues. Mr Wolfsen said the child said he had played on an XBox a lot when living with his parents. He ate bread and butter with ketchup and played with the toaster in his fatheraposs bedroom - and went to bed when he liked. When interviewed, the father said multiple bereavements had left him unable to cope, and he went into a drug-induced downward spiral. The mother accepted the house was in a poor condition saying she only lived there because she had nowhere . Both parents, who are not being named because of a court order protecting the boyaposs identity, pleaded guilty to an offence of child cruelty by neglect. Mr Wolfsen said: Heaposs been doing well in short-term foster care and will be placed into long-term foster care. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heaposs desperate to see his mum and dad and is described as being fiercely loyal to them - and asks about them. They are having supervised contact with him. The distressed mother wept in the dock during the hearing.  Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: This is a dficult sentencing exercise. When it involves an innocent child who has clearly suffered, anyoneaposs instincts would be to mete the harshest penalties on those responsible. One has to look at the facts and the circumstances. He told the parents: The prosecutor tells me youaposve had contact with your son and heaposs expressed a desire to continue contact with you and that he loves you both. Heaposs fiercely loyal to both of you. He obviously now has a bright future and the hardship heaposs suffered is potentially something that can be put behind him. Iaposm dealing with two people who werenapost, by any measure, capable of looking after a child. Iaposve been given details about what led to this awful situation arising. Both of you, historically, have drug problems and thataposs affected the way you live your lives. The court heard that one of the childaposs grandparents had been actively involved in helping to properly care for the boy at a dferent address, but when she died he ended up living where with his parents.  Other deaths in the family led to his father relapsing into former class A drug addiction. The judge said: The photographs of the house speak for themselves. Some of the rooms look like rubbish tips. Heroin needles were around, there was rotten food and flies. A police officer says, in his statement, he retched and almost threw up when he went into the house. Itaposs very fortunate the child has made a full recovery. This wasnapost evil out-and-out cruelty. The parents are themselves incapable and inadequate. There are positive measures now in their lives, in the sense of dealing with their addictions. Philip Gibbs, mitigating for the father, who is in his s, said: The defendant loves his son. Itaposs clear from the photographs he failed in his duty to care for his son.  He says prior to moving there the boy was perfectly looked after. The father, who had been clean of drugs for several years before relapsing, disagreed with some of the prosecution claims, saying the boy was given baths but had an aversion to bathing. He was taken out, he was also fed - as there was evidence of cereal boxes and take-aways. The boy had been taught how to use a kne and fork, it was claimed. He and the childaposs mother accept they struggled to maintain the house, said Mr Gibbs. The father claimed he did not seek help for fear of having his son taken away. Mr Gibbs said: He apologises to his son over and above all . They have supervised contact and the bond remains. The child loves his dad and his mum - itaposs a human tragedy. Itaposs alarming a child can disappear out of the school system for thatof time. The boy went into foster case without any real medical concerns and has thrived.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs third dates go, it couldn’t have been more romantic. Camping out under the stars in Botswana, Prince Harry said he and Meghan Markle fell in love “incredibly quickly” – proof the “stars were aligned”. It was a love story that was soon to capture the nation’s heart. The country believed they were the couple to take the Royal Family into the future, adored by a younger generation. They understood how to communicate in modern ways, without the traditional stuffy nature of The Firm. But there were concerns too. Was Meghan’s LA approach to le just too radical for the royal establishment  Few could have known then that those niggling worries would explode into a crisis just over three years later. A well-placed insider told how staff inside the palace were “apprehensive but willing to see how things panned out” with Meghan’s introduction. But they were dumbfounded within months when the former actress put her own stamp on things. The source said: “There was a lot of excitement about Meghan’s introduction but it’s fair to say there were more than a few murmurings to the contrary. “The feeling was one of concern for Harry more than anything . He’s long craved a quiet le, away from the attention that being a royal brought. “Yet somehow it seemed he had chosen someone who came from the complete opposite of the world he wanted, not to mention someone who would struggle with the boredom of royal le he often bemoaned.” The nation’s chief emotion back in  was relief that he had finally found a woman who could care for him after he had lost his beloved mother so cruelly.  We had wept as we watched a -year-old Harry fighting tears as \u2028he walked behind the coffin of Princess Diana. And we celebrated as the -year-old seemingly found his soulmate. It had not been an easy ride. Ever since his mother’s death, he had hit the headlines – and not always for the right reasons. From wearing a fancy dress Nazi unorm to naked escapades in a Las Vegas hotel, it seemed he was heading down a troubled path. But he appeared to turn his le around when he joined the Army and served in Afghanistan.  “There is no way I am going to put myself through Sandhurst then sit on my arse back home while my boys are out fighting for their country,” he said. But he still struggled to find the right partner. As brother Prince William, settled down with Kate Middleton, Harry bounced from woman to woman. From a fling with model Cassie Sumner in  to \u2028a brief relationship with Love Island presenter Caroline Flack, he seemed to struggle to find a woman who lived up to his mother’s standards. He had an on-off relationship with Chelsy Davy, between  and , when the pair met during his gap year in Cape Town. She was even his date at Prince William and Kate’s wedding.  Harry was linked to singers Mollie King and Ellie Goulding, then dated actress Cressida Bonas from  to . When that ended, due to Cressida being unable to stand the public scrutiny, the country wondered whether he would ever find the perfect woman. “I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,” he said. “So I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.” In the summer of , Harry finally found that woman. It’s believed that he was set up on a blind date with Meghan Markle at a mutual friend’s dinner party.  “I was beautully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,” said Harry. “I was like, I’m really going to have to up my game here.” Their romance moved at speed. After meeting for drinks following the blind date, they wanted to meet again. She said: “Very quickly into that we said, ‘well, what are we doing tomorrow ’” After just two dates, he asked her to join him in Botswana. “We were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other,” said Harry. As rumours of their relationship emerged, controversy followed. At , the Suits actress was three years older than Harry, orced and mixed race. Her mother Doria Ragland was orced from her dad, Thomas Markle.  But Harry was undeterred, saying he knew immediately that Meghan, was “the one”. And his desire to protect her was evident from the start. Another royal source said: “Harry believed he had struck the jackpot. He found a beautul, impressive, sophisticated woman who had successfully made her own way in the world in her career with a heart of gold to go with it. “She was socially confident and seemed to have all the characteristics to take the pressure away from Harry, who struggled adapting after army le.” After claims Meghan was receiving sexist and racist abuse, Kensington Palace released a statement to say the Prince was “deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her”. It just brought the couple closer, with Meghan often staying at Nottingham Cottage in Kensington Palace.  And on May ,  – the day that would become future son Archie’s birthday – they first appeared in public together. Meghan, from Los Angeles, cheered on her boyfriend at a polo match and the couple were photographed kissing. As their first anniversary approached they ed to Botswana, staying at a wildle habitat and visiting the Victoria Falls. Rumours circulated that a proposal was on the cards, especially when Meghan met the Queen at Balmoral to get her approval. Harry joked it probably helped that the corgis took to Meghan “straight away”. With both families on board, Harry popped the question that November as the couple shared a quiet night in at Nottingham Cottage.  They were apparently cooking roast chicken when the prince got down on one knee. “It was just an amazing surprise,” said Meghan. Harry incorporated two stones from his mother’s jewellery collection, along with a diamond from Botswana, in the engagement ring. The couple began planning their wedding and Meghan started the procedure of becoming a royal. She quit acting, closed her personal social media accounts and learned the etiquette of a future duchess. Another palace insider said: “Meghan made huge sacrices to be with Harry. She gave up her successful acting career, lestyle business, arguably her ability to speak freely on big issues she had been invested in.  “But there was a feeling the opportunity of joining the family, not to mention the love she felt for Harry, would mean those sacrices would be worth it to make the real change in the world that she had talked about. The public had been wowed with his choice of partner –glamorous, mixed race, a successful and impressive young woman who could bring the monarchy up to date. “The Queen has always reminded the family public admiration and acceptance are important for the monarchy’s survival and to not forget that when thinking of outside influences. But it quickly seemed like Harry and Meghan were moving in dferent circles, away from the centuries old tradition.  “A look at their wedding guests should have been a sign, such as when former confidants or lelong friends were replaced by global superstars \u2028like Elton John and Oprah Winfrey – two people who have become highly influential in the couple’s lives.” On May , , Prince Harry stood at the altar of St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle. As Meghan walked down the aisle beside Prince Charles, due to the absence of her own father, Harry could not take his eyes off her. As she reached his side, he whispered: “You look amazing.” And she did.

The Queen informally referred to the pair as Harry and Meghan in a statement this week, a highly unusual break from protocol which prompted speculation they could be forced to give up their royal titles. But signs of the coupleaposs departure may have been there all along and show they have a wider masterplan for their new lives, royal expert Joe Little claims. Baby Archie is entitled to be known as The Earl of Dumbarton, owing to his lofty status as the first-born son of HRH Prince Harry. However, Harry and Meghan have decided not to use the name and instead decided he would be styled as Master Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in accordance with their wished that he be raised as a private citizen. Last weekaposs announcement now has some keen observers wonderingthey were in fact planning to leave the family for some time. Joe Little, the managing editor of Majesty magazine, said : The fact Archie isnapost Earl of Dumbarton or styled HRH makes me wonder whether this wasnapost already part of a wider masterplan.The Earl of Dumbarton is a secondary title that was created for Harry on his wedding by the Queen and refers to the Dumbarton in the area West Dunbartonshire, Scotland.Prince Harry may have even offered a clue he wanted out of the spotlight as a young boy , according to an anecdote by his former protection officer. Ken Wharfe recalled how he overheard four-year-old Prince Harry telling his brother he could could do what he wanted because he would never be king. Wharfe recalled the fascinating incident which happened as the family were travelling from London to Gloucester during a weekend over thirty years ago.According to Wharfe, Prince Harry and his brother William became locked in an argument as they drove to their destination.

Shocking footage shows the roof of a building in ruins on the high street in Slough after it was blown off this evening. The building is believe to be used for residential and commercial purposes. A bystander who filmed the incident on his mobile phone posted a clip on Twitter, showing debris and bags being blown around the street. People can be seen trying to salvage shop signs and awnings that were narrowly missed by the huge structure. One person who lives in the block of flats told MailOnline they heard the roof groaning shortly before it flew off. The incident happened just before pm. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror A taxi driver has described how his car was only metres away from being hit by the falling roof. Haris Baig, , from Slough, said he was driving along the High Street when he saw a large section of roof crash down in front of him. He said: At first I thought it was scaffolding, but then I realised the whole roof had come down. There was a massive amount of noise. I was about  metres away and slammed on my brakes. I got out to seeeveryone was alright. That was my first reaction, but at the same time I was thinking is this even safe  Mr Baig said he did not see anyone injured, but heard that one person had broken their leg. It was a disaster. It was a miracle no one was killed.  South Central Ambulance Service say it’s thought there were no injuries during the incident. A Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said three fire engines attended the scene after the roof was removed aposin the windapos. The fire service are not apos% sureaposanyone is still in the building.He added: The roof has come off in the wind. The current situation is trying to make the scene safe. A council spokesman has urged people to avoid the area: We are aware of the incident in Slough High Street and specialist officers are on route to assist emergency services. Thames Valley Police wrote on Twitter: Officers are currently at the scene of an incident in Slough. It is believed that part of a building in the High Street has collapsed as a result of the weather conditions. We do not believe that anyone has been seriously injured, and we are working with other emergency services to make the scene safe.The road is closed and people are advised to avoid the area. Thank you to everyone for their ongoing patience while we deal with the incident.  Housing firm Paradigm Housing said the incident in Slough had affected one of its properties, although it is unclear whether the roof had come off its building. In a statement on Twitter, the firm said: “We are aware of an incident affecting one of our properties in Slough. “We have staff on site and are working with the emergency services and supporting residents. “If you need to contact us please ring    where you will be connected to our out of hours provider.” Storm Brendan pummeled the UK today, bringing transport woes for commuters as wind and rain hammered the island.  Waves crashing against a sea wall just metres from a commuter train in Dawlish, Devon, made for a risky-looking journey as mph gusts roared in. Rail passengers suffered delays and temporary speed limits were imposed due to the heavy winds and fallen trees, while drivers were advised to take extra care on the roads. High winds also forced airlines to ert seven flights scheduled to land at Gatwick Airport.  The strongest gust recorded during Storm Brendan was mph in South Uist in the Western Isles of Scotland on Monday, with winds of more than mph also recorded in Wales and the Isle Of Scilly.

Gemma Copeland, , was visiting Schoenbrunn Zoo while on holiday in Vienna, Austria, with her -week-old son Jasper and partner Shane, , last Thursday. The trio were close to the orangutan enclosure when Gemma realised Jasper needed to feed. As she sat down against the glass to feed her son, a female orangutan began watching her intently and kissing and putting her hand on the glass. Shane managed to capture the emotional -minute long encounter on his phone. Mum-of-one Gemma, a nail technician from Stockport, Gtr Manchester but now living in Cheshire, said she was left in tears by the incredible display of animal compassion. She said: “I’m mad on travelling and animals and when I booked a cheap flight to Vienna I noticed that they have the oldest zoo in the world. “During our visit, I realised we nearly missed out on seeing the orangutans so we turned around and went back.  “We couldn’t see them in their enclosure so we just said ‘let’s go home’, but I realised that they had come back out when we turned away so we went to go and look. “I went to the window for a closer look and sat down by the window so my son could see the orangutan who was roughly five or six foot away – I didn’t want to frighten her so I made myself smaller so I could take a picture. “She then got up, carried a piece of cloth to the window and sat down with me. “She looked directly into my eyes then placed her hand up asto touch my son. I was in awe of this beautul creature already. “My son wanted feeding and as it was quiet I fed him whilst I sat there. “The way the orangutan reacted took my breath away she kept looking at me, then my son then back again. “She sat with me for approximately half an hour, and kept stroking the glass and lay down next to me asto support and protect me. “I was absolutely gobsmacked and got quite a crowd of people turning up to see what was going on – people were sat watching quietly and respectfully. “It was really lovely and I didn’t want to leave – it felt incredible and I was crying so much because I couldn’t take it in.”  After Gemma shared the heart-warming moment on Facebook for her friends and family to see, it went viral – racking up millions of views, likes and shares. The new mum has since discovered the orangutan, Sol, had previously given birth to a stillborn infant, making the experience even more emotional.

However, the best chance of the opening half hour was the Jags#.A lung-busting run from Dario Zanatta nearly paid idends for the hosts but Siegrist#s legs foiled the Canadian inside the penalty area.Paul Watson saw a header drt wide from a Clark delivery before Shankland teed up Glass, only for the -year-old to fire wide once again.Zanatta once more came close on  minutes, this time glancing a Joe Cardle delivery towards goal but into the grateful arms of Siegrist.Just a minute later, the Tangerines No  was again the thorn in Thistle#s side.On his own in the six-yard box, Kenny Miller picked up on Zanatta#s cross only for the big Swiss keeper to pull off a wonder save to deny Miller from close range.Clark forced Fox into action with an audacious effort from some  yards before the former Dundee keeper halted Shankland close in.However, moments later, Shanks wasn#t to be denied his nd United goal of the season.From a Clark corner, the Scotland star had the freedom of the Thistle box to guide a header beyond a helpless Fox for - on  minutes.And Shankland was at the heart of United#s second. Picking up on the ball in the middle of the Partick half, he drove forward and slipped in Glass.The United kid#s cross-cum-shot found Adrian Sporle with the simplest of tasks to tap home unopposed for his first league goal for the club.After a frenetic first period, the second  took a while to get going but it was Ian McCall#s side on the front foot.Just before the hour-mark, the impressive Reece Cole made a powerful run into the box before his effort won the Jags a corner.However, it was United who got the scoring under way in the second half and took control with the first chance of note in the period.And it was that man Shankland again as he went on a terric -yard solo run into the Partick box before calmly slotting beyond Fox for his second of the afternoon and the Terrors# third.Peter Pawlett completed his comeback from injury on  minutes when he replaced Paul Watson.And, just a minute later, his first involvement in the game was to tee up Shankland for his third, completing a perfect hat-trick by thundering a left-foot drive into the top corner to send the ,-strong visiting support wild.One of few worries for United on the afternoon came on  minutes when Clark had to limp off injured, to be replaced by Adam King.Miller netted a late consolation for Thistle on  minutes but Robbie Neilson#s men took all the points and another step towards sealing the title.Partick Thistle XI : FoxWilliamson , Saunders, O#Ware , Penrice Cardle , Bannigan, Cole, Zanatta Jones , Miller.Subs not used: Sneddon , Harkins, Slater and Mansell.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson , Connolly, ReynoldsPowers Appere, Glass , Clark , Sporle Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sow, Stanton and Freeman.Referee: Willie Collum.Att: , ."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"back-day-glasgows-first-boom---12th-century","story":"THIS week we travel back to the late th and early th century to see how Glasgow went from a small settlement of Christians to a growing presence in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"food-rationing-glasgow---80th-anniversary","story":"JANUARY is traditionally a lean month. as families recover from the excesses of the festive season by choosing to diet, drink less and live more economically."},{"url":null,"title":"recall-glasgows-great-food-hotspots","story":"GLASWEGIANS love their scran ndash and in recent decades, thanks in part to flourishing Finnieston and the magnicent Merchant City, the city is finally gaining a reputation as a fantastic foodie haven."},{"url":null,"title":"historic-springburn-caley-railworks-re-opened-brexit-backing-tycoon","story":"A Brexiteer businessman told of his plans to buy the closed Springburn railway in a multi-million pound deal."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-marlene-glasgow-messages-mum","story":"WHEN he was a wee boy, growing up in Townhead, Bill Henderson loved a visit to Lewisrsquos department store."},{"url":null,"title":"council-must-support-key-charity","story":"IF they were called ldquoGlasgow Action on Drugs the funding would be doubled, never mind available ."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-city-council-scheme-cause-massive-funding-blow-charities","story":"MORE than  charities have lost out on crucial funding under a new scheme by Glasgow City Council, prompting claims dozens are at risk of closure due to an ldquounfair and unacceptable process."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-view-snp-must-speak-march-banners","story":"SATURDAYrsquoS independence march proved to be another example of ldquoCivic and Joyous Nationalism with a dash of hate speech and online abuse.

the UK Budget would take place on March , the same day that Scottish councils legally have to set local council tax rates.However, Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced yesterday he will publish the Scottish Government’s budget on February , allowing councils to arrange their finances on time.He said: “The timing of the UK Budget made it impossible for us to publish our own budget after the UK Government’s without drastically restricting the time for parliamentary scrutiny.“In these exceptional circumstances, created by the UK Government, it is vital we give local authorities and public services clarity on their budgets.“That is why we have made the decision to publish our budget in February which will allow local authorities to set their budgets and council tax before the legal deadline of March .”Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said the local authority can now arrange its own date, as initially scheduled, for March . He said: “It’s good that Derek Mackay is setting his budget so we will hopefully have a better understanding of what we’ll receive so we can set ours in March.”Gillian Martin, MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: “Derek Mackay has done the right thing despite the shameful delay from UK Government.“I’m very pleased with the announcement and I’m sure councils across the country are relieved he has shown this leadership. By failing to produce a budget before March , the Tories have shown a complete disregard for Scotland and our interests.”The UK Treasury previously said “nothing stops” the Scottish Parliament from passing their budget before the UK Government’s but declined to comment yesterday."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/EE-CJS-080120-1-12-789x564.jpg ","title":"refurbished statue is back in rightful place in north east town centre","story":"A refurbished statue which looks out across a north-east town centre has been painstakingly ed home.The repaired effigy of Alexander Fraser, the th Lord Saltoun, sat above the door of the council chambers on Fraserburgh’s Saltoun Square since .But the harsh weather took its toll and left the statue without a face. vw, px\"  As part of a near-£ million regeneration scheme in Fraserburgh the figurine was removed, and for the last few months, stone conservator Karolina Allan has been trying to give him a new look.With the work complete, the statue has been hoisted back into its original home, which will now be known as the Faithlie Centre.The former council chamber will be an enterprise centre to help start-up businesses as part of a £.m revamp.Specialist teams were in Fraserburgh yesterday to supervise the heavy stone statue being lted into place.Banff and Buchan area committee vice-chairman Mike Roy said it was “exciting” the effiguy had been ed to its “rightful place”.He added: “Karolina’s excellent work has transformed the statue and is a great symbol of the detailed work and traditional skills being used bring this historic building back into use.“We are all very much looking forward to the Faithlie Centre becoming a hub of local activity once again.” vw, px\"  Brian Topping, chairman of the Fraserburgh Regeneration Development Partnership, said he was pleased to see progress on part of the major project for the town was moving forward.He said: “Bringing the Faithlie Centre back into use is a major part of the regeneration work currently taking place in Fraserburgh, and I am sure everybody will pleased to see Lord Saltoun overlooking the square once again.“The investment in the town will bring new and improved opportunities for Aberdeenshire Council, our partners and the public and this marks a great start for the year ahead.”Alexander Fraser was known as the “Waterloo Saltoun” after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars.The statue was created by London-based sculptor Edward Stephen and arrived in , six years after Lord Saltoun died."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer.

Statistics show there are nearly  tourists for every  residents in Edinburgh, and it begs the question, are we really managing the impact of tourism well Annually our Capital city is influxed with tourists for the Hogmanay celebrations and the Fringe. Whilst it great to see tourism booming in Edinburgh, we need to see more affirmative action to encourage tourists to see more of Scotland, including the Borders. We are located only an hour south of Edinburgh, yet we see very little of the footfall.We need to see incentives and drivers for visitors to explore outside of Edinburgh. Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

stress after a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, new research suggests.The study looked at the psychological impact of early-stage pregnancy loss.Researchers looked at  women who had experienced early pregnancy loss.They majority had suffered an early miscarriage ndash defined as a pregnancy loss before  weeks, or an ectopic pregnancy.Published in the journal American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the study found that one month after pregnancy loss % suffered post-traumatic stress.Almost a quarterexperienced moderate to severe anxiety, and one in ninehad moderate to severe depression.After nine months, % of women had post-traumatic stress, % had moderate to severe anxiety, and % had moderate to severe depression.Scientists at Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium say it is the largest ever study to look at the psychological impact.Professor Tom Bourne, lead author of the research from Tommyrsquos National Centre for Miscarriage Research at Imperial College London, said: ldquoPregnancy loss affects up to one in two women, and for many women it will be the most traumatic event in their le.ldquoThis research suggests the loss of a longed-for child can leave a lasting legacy, and result in a woman still suffering post-traumatic stress nearly a year after her pregnancy loss.He added: ldquoThe treatment women receive following early pregnancy loss must change to reflect its psychological impact, and recent efforts to encourage people to talk more openly about this very common issue are a step in the right direction.One in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, and estimates suggest there are , miscarriages every year in the UK, and around , emergency admissions for ectopic pregnancies.The latter always result in pregnancy loss, as an embryo grows in an area outside of the womb and is unable to develop.The women in the study attended the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units at three London hospitals ndash Queen Charlottersquos and Cha, St Maryrsquos, and Cha and Westminster.They were asked to complete questionnaires about their emotions and behaviour one month after pregnancy loss, then again three and nine months later.Their responses were compared to  women who had healthy pregnancies.According to the results, the psychological symptoms of women with healthy pregnancies were signicantly lower than in women who had suffered early pregnancy loss.Participants who met the criteria for post-traumatic stress reported regularly re-experiencing the feelings associated with the pregnancy loss, and suffering intrusive or unwanted thoughts about their miscarriage.Some also reported having nightmares and flashbacks.The authors caution the study used a questionnaire for screening, but formal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder would require a clinical interview.They add that women who were already experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression may have been more likely to respond to the questionnaire.This could mean the number of women suffering psychological symptoms may appear higher.Dr Jessica Farren, first author of the research from Imperial College, and obstetrician and

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now.

Paramedics stretcher Homer into an ambulance.It drives off, crashes into a tree, the back doors swing open and Homer rolls out on his stretcher and falls back down the mountain.Thatrsquos Scottish Labour. The party is incapable of putting a foot right. In fact, when it tries to put a foot right, its giant clown shoes step on a rake that hits it in the face.Labour has been in chaos since it got thumped senseless by voters at the General Election. The shenanigans over what to do about independence have been a popcorn-gobbling sight to behold.Some members want a second referendum, some donrsquot. Some like federalism, some donrsquot.Some think independence is inevitable, some would rather get all Johnsonian and die in a ditch than yield to the evil Nats.In an attempt to sort this absolute parody of a sham of a farce out, leader Richard Leonard planned a special conference on the constitution, to consider whether the party should back Indyref, with federalism maybe a third option on the ballot.That sounded a good idea. Have a debate, settle on a position ndash stick to it. Voters like that kind of thing. But no, thatrsquos way too easy for Labour. Too painless. Better to collectively clamber naked into a bag of razor blades and jump around.The partyrsquos Scottish Executive Committee rejected Leonardrsquos idea. Instead, the party will now have an ldquoaway day to discuss the constitution. An ldquoaway day. Are we in a Carry On film  Carry on Incompetent  The headlines were inevitable. It was ldquoutterly humiliating. A ldquocomplete mess.Scottish Labour is disintegrating before our eyes. This is the partyrsquos twilight.Labour cannot cope with the constitutional demands of the st century. Brexit and Scottish independence are killing it.The problem with Labour is Labour. The party of today is in love with the idea of itself, with the history of the party. Itrsquos astherersquos a shrine to Keir Hardiersquos flat-cap where all members must genuflect. The only problem is: the public couldnrsquot care less about Labour traditions and purity. Things changed years ago, Labour just hasnrsquot caught up.It all seems funny, but in truth itrsquos tragic. Scotland needs a ing Labour Party ndash any democracy needs a strong voice from the left. The SNP dresses in progressive clothes, but itrsquos really just been stealing for years now from what was once Labourrsquos wardrobe. Scottish democracy would be much more robustthere were an authentic left-wing party standing up for ordinary people. So what are Labourrsquos options  You can game the strategies ndash but none of them look good for Labour.First, the party can stick with the position it has on the constitution. The problem is, though, that most of the public will say, ldquowhat is that position . One minute Labour seems to be moving towards support for Indyref, or devo max, and the next itrsquos walking everything backwards.Also, voters kicked Labour so hard in the head on its present position at the election that the party is now effectively wearing its face upside down. Labour lost six out of seven MPs and came third behind the Tories on . per cent of the vote.What about federalism or devo max  This is such a sad debate for Labour to have ndash because itrsquos pointless and it will not save them, yet many in the party seem to think of federalism as the leboat which will carry them to safety.Before Brexit, some form of federalism may have been an option, but not now. Surely even Labour can see that  How will federalism appeal to voters who care about the EU  It will not retain their EU citizenship. It wonrsquot appeal to Yes voters, as they want independence. Federalism wonrsquot appeal to Remain voters as they want back in the EU.Federalism is an escape tunnel with an armed guard waiting at the end of it.Nor will the mechanics of federalism work. In a federal UK all voices would need to be equal ndash thatrsquos the point. However, England has a population of  million, Scotland . million.Unless federalism involves England being balkanised into a series of regions ndash Yorkshire, Cornwall, the Midlands ndash with roughly equivalent populations, it will be entirely undemocratic and unfair. Why would England agree to that  No-onersquos even asked the English.So, should Labour adopt a neutral position on independence  Drop opposition to it, but donrsquot campaign as a party for it ndash allow members a free vote on independence. It sounds nice, but we need only remember the partyrsquos position on Brexit at the election.Trying to play both sides may sound super-smart and slippery, but the electorate doesnrsquot buy it.What about going full ultra-unionist  Well, Labour tried that in  and that was the start of its terminal decline. Former Deputy Leader Alex Rowley, also constitution spokesman, tweeted that too many Labour apparatchiks still feel Better Together and ldquostanding alongside the Tories is the best way forward. If a voter wants unionism, theyrsquove got the Conservatives.Whatrsquos left  The remaining option is to back independence. Every other path is closed off. Could it work  Could the party reconfigure itself, setting out a leftwing case for independence ndash taking the nationalism out of the Yes movement  Might that bring back progressives who left Labour for the SNP  Therersquos plenty of such voters out there who arenrsquot natural SNP supporters.Some Labour figures see the writing on the wall. Ben Bradshaw MP, who was in government with Blair and Brown, says hersquos ldquo% certain Scotland will become independent.MSP Monica Lennon thinks the Scottish party should split from the UK party. The idea is hard to fault.Of course, backing independence could immediately cause Labour to implode. Members might flee, senior figures quit. Would voters be drawn from the SNP to Labour  Itrsquos unlikely.

Stephen sat with a full set of teeth on display, his smile was stretched broad.On the other side, Jonathans mouth was in an appalled downward twist, his head occasionally in his hands.Finally, I have seen Cats, and friends... I loved it.In general, I believe musicals to be artistic atrocities. Singing, I like. Acting, I like. Singing and acting combined  No, thank you anyway.So I had no impetus to go and see Cats the film. I have, full disclosure, seen Cats on the stage and it was tolerable because the characters sang and danced and barely talked so it wasnt a musical of the traditional, \"Im inappropriately bursting in to song instead of finishing this sentence,\" iety.The only thing that drew me to Cats the movie was the promise of two hours of atrocious film making.Im a member of a Bad Movie Club and we thrive on this stuff. The Room. Sharktopus. Its follow up Sharktopus vs Whalewolf. Would Cats be more gloriously awful than Birdemic, the best worst movie ever \"Nearly as obscene as The Human Centipede,\" ran the . \"A monstrosity.\" \"A descent into madness\". One magazine claimed its reviewers had lost all nine of their lives, another tirade said the film was \"straight out of the litter box\".The most tantalising headline simply ran, Cats: Spay It.I was there for it. A motion picture horror piece with the added trauma of James Corden. What could be gloriously worse Well, much, it turned out. Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath. Others have been upset that Old Deuteronomy wears a fur coat... on top of her own coat of fur.Yet more whiny babies emphasised distress that the cats had fingers. Yes, it certainly would lt the whole film to make the singing, dancing, talking cats more realistic.Bizarrely, no one seemed bothered by Bombalurinas high heels or Taylor Swts horric faux-British accent. These were the only downsides.Lack of a plot has been another incoherent grumble  Too much plot would be a more sensible complaint. Cats is a back-to-back collection of little stand alone stories. It heaves with plots, drips with them.The inidual stories of the cats are marvellous. The Rum Tum Tugger is everycat, recognisable to anyone whos ever lived in service to a cat: \"When you let me in I want to go out.\"Skimbleshanks is missing and the night train cant go without him. Oh here he is! And what a brilliant picture is painted of the sleeper service in that three and a half minutes.Mungojerry and Rumpleteasers song is all charm and humour, a colourful vignette.But looking at it for story is nitpicky nonsense in any case its a two hour  for song and dance.And look at the lyrics. But looking at it for story is nitpicky nonsense in any case itrsquos a two hour  for song and dance.And look at the lyrics. ldquoPractical cats, dramatical cats, pragmatical cats, fanatical cats, oratorical cats, delphic-oracle cats, skeptical cats, dyspeptical cats.\"How about: \"In the light of the door which opens on her like a grin, you can see the corner of her eye twists like a crooked pin\".

Thus far, Ms Sturgeon and her senior colleagues have not ruled out the option of reverting to the courts to try to overturn the PMrsquos rejection but, given Westminster remains, by law, the constitutional authority on referendums, it is hard to see how a legal challenge could succeed.Mr MacNeil told The Herald: ldquoThere has only been in existence Plan A and now Boris has vetoed it. People are quickly casting around for other ideas. He suggested two possible ones Ms Sturgeon might consider.Firstly, to get Holyrood to organise its own ldquolegal referendum and seeWestminster were to challenge it in the courts which would undoubtedly be the case.Secondly, to turn next yearrsquos Scottish parliamentary election into a straight vote on Scotlandrsquos future and thatthe SNP gained a majority of MSPs, then this would result in the nation becoming independent.Mr MacNeil argued thatit was good enough for Mr Johnson to take Britain out of the EU on a vote share of  per cent and a majority of Westminster seats at the December General Election, then the same democratic rule should apply to Scotland and thatthe SNP secured a majority of Holyrood seats in , this would be regarded as the Scottish people voting for independence.ldquoThe great thing about what Boris has done is that it has provided movement I thought he would have kept Scotland dangling for a good year. But he has moved the independence process on. We now have to do something to keep things moving, insisted the Western Isles MP.Earlier, the PM rejected Ms Sturgeonrsquos call for a second independence referendum, saying to hold another vote on Scotlandrsquos future would ldquocontinue the political stagnation of the last decade.In a letter, replying to the one the FM sent before Christmas, Mr Johnson told her: ldquoThe UK Government will continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise that you made to them. For that reason I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums.\"The Tory leader raised his response at the weekly Cabinet, which, his spokesman pointed out, had offered its \"full support\" for his decision to refuse Ms Sturgeons request, noting how it had been taken in ldquoclose consultation with Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary.ldquoThe PM said: lsquoThis Government has an optimistic vision for Scotland and our whole country in , investing in levelling up in every part of the UK.\"rsquoWe do not want the s in Scotland to repeat the previous SNPs lost decade when Scottish schools, hospitals and jobs were left behind because of their campaign to separate the United Kingdom,rsquo\" said the spokesman.But Ms Sturgeon insisted Mr Johnsonrsquos decision had shown ldquoutter contempt for the votes, views and interests of the people of Scotland and was a strategy that was ldquodoomed to failure.She claimed the longer the ldquoWestminster Union tried to block a referendum, the more support for independence would grow.ldquoThe Westminster Union cannot be sustained without consent.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities.

In the days before devolution, it was often the last line of defence against attacks on local communities waged by Tory governments. But it was also an arena for innovation and local initiative. Some ideas pioneered at council level found their way on to the national stage in housing and transport, in equalities, education and even economic development. And they still do.So I agree with Alison Evison, the president of our councils’ umbrella body Cosla, when she said this week that we are talking of “the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s citizens”.And of course, her comments about local government’s importance come not in the abstract, but as context to a stern real-world warning. Ahead of the Scottish Government’s budget, she noted that “whichever way you want to dress it up, the reality is that in recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out”.: SNP plans mean ‘more austerity than under the Tories’, says IFS: Brexit means Scotland now ‘likely’ to vote for independence, says Labour MPIt’s not just her view – or mine. Fteen months ago, the Accounts Commission concluded that “funding for local government from the Scottish Government decreased at a faster rate, . per cent, than the Scottish Government revenue budget at . per cent”. In other words, for all their attempts to blame the Tories – who it is true have decimated local government in England – for the failed experiment of austerity, SNP ministers in Edinburgh have quadrupled the cuts that were handed down to them.Passing the buckBut how could any Scottish government get away with this  From schools to home care, from libraries to bin collections – with the possible exception of the NHS, this is where most of Scotland’s people interact with government and the public sector. Councils and councillors are also citizens’ first port of call when things go wrong – from the heating in rented flats to elderly relatives left in the lurch without a care plan. Surely it would be politically toxic to take the axe to council budgets in exactly the way the SNP has done Unfortunately, ministers have cynically deployed the very fact that local government is closer to Scotland’s citizens in order to shirk responsibility. So when I challenged Nicola Sturgeon over failing care services in South Lanarkshire at First Minister’s Questions last week, she was happy to pass the buck to the SNP-controlled council. And by proxy, she passed the buck to ordinary citizens, who will feel a closer affinity to councils and the services they provide than they do to national governments. While many people consider there to be a direct link between the council tax levied on their homes and the services which they receive, council tax accounted for only £. billion of local government revenue in -. Non-domestic rates accounted for £. billion, but the majority – £. billion – came from the General Revenue Fund allocated by the Scottish Government.And there have been consequences as a result of the SNP Government’s approach.Rising demand for servicesIn , Scotland’s councils held assets valued at £. billion. But rather than a reassurance, we should take this as a warning. These possessions range from single-occupancy flats, to pension fund investments, to architectural gems held in trust for the public they were built to serve. They are each attached to signicant costs or debts. And as councils struggle with rising demand for services such as home care, alongside falling budgets, the cost demand of servicing these assets and the potential sale revenues will make it more and more alluring for councils to be tempted to dispose of them.It is often cultural services which suffer first:  public libraries closed their doors altogether in Scotland in  alone. Many others have seen their hours cut. We are now reaching the point, however, that even statutory services like home care find themselves truly at breaking point. In the past three years,  of Scotland’s  councils have been forced to draw down from their reserves. As a result, councils now hold £ million less in reserves than they did just a year ago.Central Government ministers have set targets and commitments for local government, which could be an effective means of improving services. But without giving councils the financial resources they need to meet these, it becomes simply an effective means of shting the blame for austerity.Devolution of powerSo ahead of the Scottish budget on March , Scottish Labour is calling on the SNP Government to ditch the easy blame games and take some responsibility. Just because there is greater local accountability for local government services, it doesn’t mean central Government can abdicate responsibility for a deliberate choice to underfund them.But we won’t stop there. Over a decade after the SNP promised to abolish the council tax, local government increasingly finds itself under central control: including over the setting of council tax. That’s why I want the principle of subsidiarity – the devolution of power as close as possible to the grass roots – to form part of Scottish Labour’s offer on constitutional reform. A particular challenge is now facing us. With the onset of Brexit, the powers which currently lie with the European Union will be repatriated. The question is where to. They cannot be concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. They must be devolved. But the strengthening of local government must be part of that.Local government, unfashionable a cause as it may be, will be the bedrock of a more democratic future for Scotland. It should be about bread but it should be about roses as well: theatres and swimming pools as well as roads and bin collections. It is a means to establishing a better, more empowered and more enriched quality of le for our citizens.It is critical to inspiring renewed confidence and rekindled hope in every community across Scotland.But that can’t be done on the cheap. So let’s remind the Scottish Government that now is the time for fair funding for Scotland’s local council services.Richard Leonard is Scottish Labour leader and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dire state of scottish labour revealed in leaked report","story":"A damning leaked report on the state of Scottish Labour, has lain out the scale of the partys problems as it looks to regroup in the wake of near wipe-out at the General Election.A progress report, part of review of the internal structures of the party being carried out by Lesley Laird, who until December was Shadow Scottish Secretary and deputy of Scottish Labour until losing her seat, has said there is an \"urgent need to make some tough choices\"the party is to \"move the dial\" on its political ambitions.The report, which was commissioned by Labours Scottish Executive Committee at the end of  - before the party saw its vote share collapse to . per cent in last years European elections, and thenjust one MP to Westminster last month - exposes the dire financial straits of the party, as well as a lack of a plan to resolve the situation.: Lesley Laird takes swipe at party in stepping down as Scottish Labour deputy leaderIt states there is \"no detailed financial or business plan\" for Scottish Labour, that there is \"no membership strategy\", that fundraising is \"limited and not aligned to strategy, business plan or political objectives\", internal structures are \"dislocated\" and staff are \"frustrated and demotivated\" as a result of undermining actions by elected politicians.Overall, it says theres \"simply not enough oversight, governance and hands on working by SEC members with the party officers and political leaders in core areas\", which has \"contributed to high levels of frustration and ultimately a break down in their ability to provide the level of governance needed on key aspects of the party’s operations in Scotland.”The progress report was presented to the SEC at the same Saturday meeting which saw the party leader Richard Leonard have his proposal for a conference on the partys approach to a second independence referendum defeated.It also criticises the party for failing to implement the recommendations of previous internal reviews, dating back to , and emphasises a need for the whole organisation to become more \"professional\", putting that task in the hands of the new Scottish General Secretary Michael Sharpe.Morale is a big problem, the report says, with staff feeling \"frustrated and demotivated when elected representatives through their words and actions undermine the huge amount of work and effort they are making to deliver for our party.: Labour appoint English MP as shadow Scotland Secretary\"We also do not make the best use of our resources and hiring has been done at times in what feels like a siloed approach. There are opportunities to improve reach and ersication of our recruitment and selection procedures. The new General Secretary should undertake a review of all roles and responsibilities aligned to Scotland. They should be mapped against the strategic and political objectives, and where required changes should be implemented.\"The partys communications are also criticised, with the lack of an \"integrated communications plan joining up print, digital, social media.\" The report states: Politically the landscape has fundamentally changed, and we have failed to come to terms with it and adjust or mody the way we do things.\"Many of these fundamental issuescontribute to our ability to articulate our core policy messages and to carry them effectively into communities and the media. An integrated communications plan is required to be developed that takes account the changed political landscape and the rise in social and digital media.\" The report also recommends hiring a full-time fundraiser immediately, noting: “The current UK model provides a successful template for how this position can be financed and results delivered.”it also recommends looking at moving party headquarters from Glasgow to Edinburgh to be closer to the Scottish Parliament.The party said the document was not the final Laird review report and was still “subject to change” as the review was ongoing, though was expected to be completed shortly.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"strike action looms at sullom voe ","story":"Industrial action could soon be on the cards at Sullom Voe Terminal after union Unite announced it will ballot its members.This follows talks with EnQuest on terms and conditions, including pensions.In a consultative ballot held over the festive period,  per cent of Unite members voted to reject EnQuest’s proposed changes to terms and conditions on a  per cent turnout.Unite launched the ballot to coincide with the end of a y internal dispute process involving the union and the company, which has produced no agreement.John Clark, Unite regional industrial officer, said: #Unite will now move forward with an industrial action ballot at Sullom Voe which we have received a resounding mandate for from our membership.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"energy saving campaign focuses on electric heating ","story":"This year the campaign will attempt to reach two groups of people: those who use electric heating and those who have homes that are hard to heat.As part of a national campaign the bureau will hold two community events.

However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Infrastructure  Concurrently, the Irish government has pledged to work with the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government to achieve greater connectivity on this island – by road, rail and air. “We believe this is an immediate opportunity to move forward quickly together to deliver on plans to complete key infrastructure projects including the A and the Ulster Canal connection from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. “The Government will deliver on its funding commitments to those projects, including a total of pound million up to  for the A. “The Irish Government also intends to take forward a review of the potential for Government support to renewed viable air routes from Cork to Belfast and Dublin to Derry, working with the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to deliver improved connections as a priority.” The Government has also recognised that the North West region is in particular need of strategic investment, and that there is a clear argument for further enhancing cross-border cooperation and connections, to the benefit of all. The Irish Government welcomed the UK Government’s announcement to invest up to poundm in Derry and the North West through the Derry and Strabane City Deal and the Inclusive Future Fund. It is committed to exploring opportunities for investment that will further support opportunities to bring greater economic prosperity and social benefits to the wider region. “In this context, the Irish Government welcomes the development of plans for ambitious new higher education provision in Derry,” the document reads. “This investment can support more access to third-level education for young people on a cross-border basis, enable further cooperation between third-level institutions in the North West including in research and innovation, and underpin broader economic development and opportunities in the region. “The Government is willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government. “We look forward to early discussion at the North South Ministerial Council on taking forward this coordinated investment in order to deliver this vital project for the North West region,” it adds.  Foyle River Gardens As part of the North West Strategic Growth Partnership the Irish government is “ready to continue discussions” on key projects for employment and sustainable development in the region, including the Foyle River Gardens – described as Northern Ireland’s Eden project, after the popular visitor attraction in Cornwall, England. The Government will also maintain the enhanced level of funding for the Reconciliation Fund at €. million per year in support of projects in Northern Ireland and border areas, with a focus on the most hard-to-reach and marginalised communities in terms of economic and social deprivation. “Ireland has consistently prioritised the continuation of EU PEACE funding including through ongoing engagement at EU level. We will continue work with our EU partners and the UK Government and Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the PEACE PLUS programme, building on and continuing the work of both PEACE and INTERREG, will be delivered through the Special EU Programmes Body in support of reconciliation and harnessing the opportunities of our peace for all,” it concludes.

Gordon Lyonsand Declan Kearneywill serve as junior ministers.Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister.Members of the executiveThe other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds , Minister for education: Peter Weir , Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots , Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey , Minister for finance: Conor Murphy , Minister for health: Robin Swann , Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon .DferencesAddressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have many dferences.Michelles narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine, she said.Im not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.Commitment to powerMichelle ONeill said it was her sincere wish that  brings real change.I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Irelands future beyond Brexit.Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like.”‘Wonderful compromise’Visiting Belfast on Monday, Boris Johnson hailed the wonderful compromise that has seen theof devolution to Northern Ireland, after meeting Stormonts newly-appointed leaders in Belfast.The prime minister said Stormont was open for business again in the wake of the restoration of power-sharing following three years of political deadlock.Mr Johnson praised politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland, saying they had put aside their dferences, stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.I just want to say how grateful I am to all the parties, to everybody here in Northern Ireland, for the way they have compromised the way they have worked together to get Stormont up and running once again, he said.Its shown a willingness to trust each other and to set aside dferences and I think its absolutely commendable and wonderful to see.Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder... I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward.And I hope that with goodwill and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed.The British government made a number of financial promises to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line.Major investmentNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith promised major investment to tackle problems in Northern Irelands struggling public services, but declined to confirm the sums involved until devolution was restored.Ministers at Stormont are now keen to nail down precise figures.There are reports the government could announce a poundbn package, but a Downing Street source has described this figure as just speculation.And Mr Johnson himself did not answer when asked by journalists about the poundbn figure.Additionally, the Irish government made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north south projects, such as the A dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.‘Critical reforms’Speaking ahead of the discussions, Mr Johnson said they will focus on how the executive intended to take forward critical reforms to public services.This is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland, he said.After three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving peoples lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.The previous DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in acrimony in January .The cause was a row about a botched green energy scheme, a dispute that later widened to include more traditional wrangles on issues like the Irish language and the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Johnson said in his news conference that there could be no repetition of the scandal.It is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing, he said.The prime minister added that the new agreement contained provision for proper responsibility for the use of public funds. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mallon admitted he consulted Parkhouse about the move before agreeing to move to Derry City. “He was here last season and the Derry fans will know all about him so he spoke quite highly of the league and said he had a great time here,” he explained.“When he came back he had put himself into a much better position than he was in before and that’s something that I want to do myself. He came here, he did really well and he’s held in high regard since he’s gone back and that’s something I’ll be look to doing myself.”Mallon, who can play in a number of positions, can usually be found on the left wing but has also been known to drop into full back comfortably. He spent part of  on loan in Australia’s A-League with the Central Coast Mariners making several first team appearances. The Belfast man has also represented both Northern Ireland and the Republic at international youth levels, and most recently he has featured for Stephen Kenny’s Irish U side. Mallon has not played in the League of Ireland before, but he certainly knows all about it. “I know a lot about the league,” he said. “Being in the international squad you get lads who are still in Ireland all the way through from when I went away with Ireland when I was  all the way through to . The lads were still at home playing football for their local teams or for a team in the League of Ireland.”Mallon joins Walter Figueira, Conor Clford and Connor McCormack as the new faces at the Brandywell this season, and with the new campaign just over a month away from kicking off, the newest addition to the City squad can’t wait to get going. “It’s a massive opportunity and I just want to take my chance and work hard to get in the team,” he stated. “Even though I’m coming over I know that nothing’s promised so I need to get myself in the team so hopefully I can get myself in the team, stay in the team and do well for the team and hopefully we can get some success this season.” googletag.cmd.push High hopesCity boss Declan Devine is confident that he has unearthed another Sheffield United gem, and expects Mallon to enjoy himself at Derry City as much as Parkhouse did in .“He’s a talented boy and someone I’ve known for a long time,” he explained. “It’s very similar to the Parkhouse situation last year in that it’s a Sheffield United player, a very technical player, a player with flair with a fantastic left foot who can play in midfield or the left wing and can also slot in at left back. He’s a player who gives us versatility, a player who saw the benefits of what David Parkhouse did here last year and he’s a guy who wants to prove himself at the highest level. “I’m delighted to welcome Stephen to the club because he’s going to be a great addition for us going foraard.

I’ve consistently said that we have to strengthen our squad and we have to have a high level of performance throughout the coming season, and we are very much in the market looking for players. We have a lot of targets and as I said last season we certainly won’t be bringing players to the club who we haven’t done our homework on. “You’ll see a bit of action at this club over the coming days. At the same time Junior Ogedi came to this club five days before the start of the season last year. We had players in on trial at this time last year and they didn’t fit the bill but that’s just the nature of it. “The league is quite quiet at the minute and you only have to look at Dundalk who have only signed two players, but let’s not forget we have Walter Figueira here, we have Conor Clford, Connor McCormack and we have signed someone from Sheffield United so let’s not underestimate the work that has been done. We are fully aware that we have to bring in a high level of player and we will do that, there’s no doubt about that.” googletag.cmd.push QualityCity kick off their new season with a trip to champions Dundalk on February , and Devine believes that the entire Premier Division this season is as strongest as it has ever been.“This is the toughest I’ve seen the league in a number of years,” he stated. “You only have to look at Shelbourne coming up to replace UCD and I think St. Pat’s are going to invest in their new manager quite heavily. You have Bohemians who have signed  players, Shamrock Rovers who have six full internationals and Dundalk who are hoping to break into the group stages of the Champions League. “We can’t underestimate anyone, and looking at ourselves we also have to strive to get better and make sure that the fundamentals that were part of our plan last year stay the same. We are under no illusions that we will have to work extremely hard because that’s in our DNA.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’ve consistently said that we have to strengthen our squad and we have to have a high level of performance throughout the coming season, and we are very much in the market looking for players. We have a lot of targets and as I said last season we certainly won’t be bringing players to the club who we haven’t done our homework on. “You’ll see a bit of action at this club over the coming days. At the same time Junior Ogedi came to this club five days before the start of the season last year. We had players in on trial at this time last year and they didn’t fit the bill but that’s just the nature of it. “The league is quite quiet at the minute and you only have to look at Dundalk who have only signed two players, but let’s not forget we have Walter Figueira here, we have Conor Clford, Connor McCormack and we have signed someone from Sheffield United so let’s not underestimate the work that has been done. We are fully aware that we have to bring in a high level of player and we will do that, there’s no doubt about that.” googletag.cmd.push QualityCity kick off their new season with a trip to champions Dundalk on February , and Devine believes that the entire Premier Division this season is as strongest as it has ever been.“This is the toughest I’ve seen the league in a number of years,” he stated. “You only have to look at Shelbourne coming up to replace UCD and I think St. Pat’s are going to invest in their new manager quite heavily. You have Bohemians who have signed  players, Shamrock Rovers who have six full internationals and Dundalk who are hoping to break into the group stages of the Champions League. “We can’t underestimate anyone, and looking at ourselves we also have to strive to get better and make sure that the fundamentals that were part of our plan last year stay the same. We are under no illusions that we will have to work extremely hard because that’s in our DNA.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  year-old and co-driver Brian Hoy will face in the European Rally Championship this season. “Its nice to get it and we are going in the right direction,” beamed an enthusiastic Devine, in an interview with the County Derry Post. Last year, , was somewhat of a break after the WRC but he was asked by Hyundaihe would be interested in taking part in Rally Hungary. “They put together a deal for me to do that along with Motorsport Ireland. They said theyd give me a chance, it went well and we finished third,” Devine recalls. googletag.cmd.push Devine, who was recently crowned Irish International Driver of the Year, was full of praise for Hyundai, Motorsport Ireland and to John Coyne for making it all happen. After winning the Billy Coleman Young Driver of the Year in , Callum debuted in the Junior WRC with some notable performances, none more than his debut in the snow of Rally Sweden where he finished sixth. Casting his mind back to the experiences of that season and all its thrills and spills, it was something he always felt he would back to. In Rally Portugal, he was comfortable in second place before a steering fault forced him to retire with three stages to go. When the championship was complete he lay in fourth place overall,  points behind third placed Jean-Baptiste Franceschi. googletag.cmd.push “I remember going to Corsica. Wed be writing notes for the stage, then watching a DVD to check your notes. “Youd be in bed late and up early in the morning, it would be demanding on the body but look...It was a bit of a shock to the system. “It was a good unseen learning year for us. It is a lot more demanding than anybody every thinks until you are in it.” Devine name checked the likes of Craig Breen and Chris Meeke as some of those who were an ear to listen to, giving him the support. Round one of this years European circuit takes place on the Azores, off the coast of Portugal in late March. For now, his preparation is about keeping the body ticking over, getting out for a run to hone his fitness. “Come mid-February, we will do some testing in the car to figure out the set-up and what we have to work with. “The Azores is going to be the most dficult one , it is a really specialist event. There are a lot of gravelly roads, it will be demanding but I am looking forward to it. We are looking to get around it , to get some points and get off to a good enough start.” What would Devine see as a success from this season  “Realistically,” he began. “There is an U category in the championship. It is a junior category for R cars. We would be trying to mix it with the guys, to try and race for honours in that. “I will leave the rest to figure itself out. Usuallyyou are quick enough in the Us, you are never that far away from the main category. “We know we have the pace for tarmac, it is just the gravel. It is about getting used to it and getting up to speed again.” In the Azores, he will be up against drivers who have raced on the circuit three or four times, experience that is priceless at this level. Last season, Hungary was the only round that was new to the championship and on a level playing field Devine achieved a podium finish. He believes in himself, but hurdling around corners on roads you have never navigated before requires confidence. Devine is also grounded and realistic. “We are not saying it is going to be an easy challenge but you have to take the opportunity when it is there and get stuck in.” The  ERC calendar is as follows: Round : Azores Rallye , - MarchRound : Rally Islas Canarias , - MayRound : Rally Liepāja , - MayRound : th Rally Poland , - JuneRound : Rally di Roma Capitale , - JulyRound : Barum Czech Rally Zliacuten , - AugustRound : Cyprus Rally , - OctoberRound : Rally Hungary , - November Callum and Brian’s  season will be supported by FYTH, Curran Gate, The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Customer Racing.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed.

Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

In  the average price increased by % to pound,, putting the area firmly at the bottom of the UK table.Over the same period the average house price in the UK increased by %, with Northern Ireland seeing a % increase over the same period.However, Mr Thompson described the housing market as ldquodelicately balanced and did not like uncertainty.He said: ldquoIn recent years we have seen a dramatic growth in the rise of temporary positions across a number of professions, including banking and teaching.ldquoWhile they are well paid positions, it means these young people are unable to attain a mortgage.Despite this, Mr Thompson says he has been seeing a growth in first time buyers lately.He said: ldquoPrices are still reasonably affordable and are in line with wages ndash this is what we estate agents call lsquoan appropriate multiplersquo.ldquoSo the cost of a mortgage still remains very competitive. I recall a period in the mid s when interest rates reached % which caused much uncertainty in the market.ldquoWe also have great schools across Co Down and this is attracting young couples from England to relocate here.Mr Thompson said one area of concern was the impact Brexit may have on the property market.He remarked: ldquoThe elephant in the market now is Brexit and it has caused the pause button to be pushed. We are still waiting as to what the up side and the down side will be.ldquoWe will soon have some clarity with the Brexit deadline on January  and this should help to stabilise the situation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Objectors.jpg","title":"Objectors to discuss Lidl store application  ","story":"A PLANNERSrsquo recommendation to approve a new poundm Lidl store in Newcastle will be discussed by local politicians at a meeting in Newry this morning.The supermarket giant is seeking permission for the new store at the former St Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School site in the town.The development proposal also includes a new pound, base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team at the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in the resort.Entrance to the proposed store will be via Bryansford Road, with the plannersrsquo approval recommendation due to be discussed at this morningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.Plans to redevelop the former primary school site were originally submitted in January  with permission being sought to bulldoze the existing school to pave the way for the construction of a new food store and the dedicated centre for the volunteers who run the mountain rescue team. Lidl claims its proposal will create an additional  jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.Permission has also been granted to a number of people to address todayrsquos Planning Committee meeting.Due to address councillors are planning consultant, Andy Stephens, who is objecting to the proposal, while Seamus McMullan Architects have requested to address politicians on behalf of Dr M Rooney who is also opposed to the Lidl proposal.Further speaking rights requests have been received from Conleth Rooney BL on behalf of Don Holdings Ltd, objecting to the application, with Lidlrsquos Norther Ireland Regional Director Conor Boyle and Nicholas McCrickard from the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team, also due to address committee members.The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos meeting, planners reaffirm that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.The store argues the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found. Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

The industrial action involves all NHS staff, not just nurses.ldquoThere is mounting concern that NHS staff are being used as a political football to pressurise the politicians to get agreement on restoring the Assembly.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

On this island, there have been recent indications that Stormont based unionists and the Irish government have a shared understanding of one of the key tenets of identity politics.They say that no one culture should be promoted above any other. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Thus, last Friday, Arlene Foster, by way of commending the new Stormont deal, said: “This is a deal that recognises that no one identity should be placed over another” she added that the deal worked because it recognised that there are people in Northern Ireland with an Irish identity and others with a British identity. Meanwhile Charlie Flanagan, the Republic’s Minister for Justice, in a statement issued last week promoting a state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary , said: “[our approach] has made clear that there is no hierarchy of Irishness and that our goal of reconciliation on the island of Ireland can only be achieved through mutual understanding and mutual respect of the dferent traditions on the island”.Shortly after this comment, however, he was pressured into a climbdown by republicans and even, sadly, the Fianna Fail opposition.This volte face was in contrast to the note perfect articulation of identity politics by Arlene Foster, which represents the ultimate triumph of the politics of the Good Friday Belfast Agreement. The idea that Britishness in Northern Ireland is merely an identity and on a par with the “Irish identity”is not what one might expect from a leader of the DUP. Whether this is a great success for the republican movement, using identity politics as a Trojan Horse to smash unionism and reduce the Union to a mere lestyle choice, is too early to tell.What is not too early to tell is that the same republican movement is not buying into the same shibboleths of identity politics in the South at the moment: they made it very clear that they rejected Charlie Flanagan’s eloquent plea for no hierarchies of Irishness and mutual respect of dferent traditions. For them, Britishness in the Republic is not an identity worthy of respect and certainly not on a par with Irishness indeed in the bombastic language echoing about last week , Britishness in the South — as mediated by any form of respect for the sacrice and devotion to duty of ordinary Irish Catholic members of the RIC — was characterised as a type of national  consciousness comparable to reverence for the Vichy régime in France. Whilst I personally loathe the cultural relativism of identity politics, that we cannot judge one culture over another, it is undeniable that showing respect for cultures other than our own has been useful in Ireland and in dealing with the Irish question.As a gaeilgeoir I am embarrassed when Irish is imposed where it isn’t wanted Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Republicans are some of the most skilled exponents on the island of using the language of respect of identity politics while sowing ision.It is galling to watch them pretend to hold out the hand of friendship when their reaction to RIC showed that they will not tolerate anything outside their comfort zone.l Neil McCarthy is a writer and teacher based in Dublin and London©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them.

She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Almost a quarterexperienced moderate to severe anxiety, and one in ninehad moderate to severe depression.After nine months, % of women had post-traumatic stress, % had moderate to severe anxiety, and % had moderate to severe depression.Scientists at Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium say it is the largest ever study to look at the psychological impact.Professor Tom Bourne, lead author of the research from Tommyrsquos National Centre for Miscarriage Research at Imperial College London, said: ldquoPregnancy loss affects up to one in two women, and for many women it will be the most traumatic event in their le.ldquoThis research suggests the loss of a longed-for child can leave a lasting legacy, and result in a woman still suffering post-traumatic stress nearly a year after her pregnancy loss.He added: ldquoThe treatment women receive following early pregnancy loss must change to reflect its psychological impact, and recent efforts to encourage people to talk more openly about this very common issue are a step in the right direction.One in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, and estimates suggest there are , miscarriages every year in the UK, and around , emergency admissions for ectopic pregnancies.The latter always result in pregnancy loss, as an embryo grows in an area outside of the womb and is unable to develop.The women in the study attended the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units at three London hospitals ndash Queen Charlottersquos and Cha, St Maryrsquos, and Cha and Westminster.They were asked to complete questionnaires about their emotions and behaviour one month after pregnancy loss, then again three and nine months later.Their responses were compared to  women who had healthy pregnancies.According to the results, the psychological symptoms of women with healthy pregnancies were signicantly lower than in women who had suffered early pregnancy loss.Participants who met the criteria for post-traumatic stress reported regularly re-experiencing the feelings associated with the pregnancy loss, and suffering intrusive or unwanted thoughts about their miscarriage.Some also reported having nightmares and flashbacks.The authors caution the study used a questionnaire for screening, but formal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder would require a clinical interview.They add that women who were already experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression may have been more likely to respond to the questionnaire.This could mean the number of women suffering psychological symptoms may appear higher.Dr Jessica Farren, first author of the research from Imperial College, and obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ldquoPost-traumatic stress can have a toxic effect on all elements of a personrsquos le ndash affecting work, home and relationships..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy may trigger post-traumatic stress  u study article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Almost a quarterexperienced moderate to severe anxiety, and one in ninehad moderate to severe depression.After nine months, % of women had post-traumatic stress, % had moderate to severe anxiety, and % had moderate to severe depression.Scientists at Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium say it is the largest ever study to look at the psychological impact.Professor Tom Bourne, lead author of the research from Tommyrsquos National Centre for Miscarriage Research at Imperial College London, said: ldquoPregnancy loss affects up to one in two women, and for many women it will be the most traumatic event in their le.ldquoThis research suggests the loss of a longed-for child can leave a lasting legacy, and result in a woman still suffering post-traumatic stress nearly a year after her pregnancy loss.He added: ldquoThe treatment women receive following early pregnancy loss must change to reflect its psychological impact, and recent efforts to encourage people to talk more openly about this very common issue are a step in the right direction.One in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage, and estimates suggest there are , miscarriages every year in the UK, and around , emergency admissions for ectopic pregnancies.The latter always result in pregnancy loss, as an embryo grows in an area outside of the womb and is unable to develop.The women in the study attended the Early Pregnancy Assessment Units at three London hospitals ndash Queen Charlottersquos and Cha, St Maryrsquos, and Cha and Westminster.They were asked to complete questionnaires about their emotions and behaviour one month after pregnancy loss, then again three and nine months later.Their responses were compared to  women who had healthy pregnancies.According to the results, the psychological symptoms of women with healthy pregnancies were signicantly lower than in women who had suffered early pregnancy loss.Participants who met the criteria for post-traumatic stress reported regularly re-experiencing the feelings associated with the pregnancy loss, and suffering intrusive or unwanted thoughts about their miscarriage.Some also reported having nightmares and flashbacks.The authors caution the study used a questionnaire for screening, but formal diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder would require a clinical interview.They add that women who were already experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress and depression may have been more likely to respond to the questionnaire.This could mean the number of women suffering psychological symptoms may appear higher.Dr Jessica Farren, first author of the research from Imperial College, and obstetrician and gynaecologist, said: ldquoPost-traumatic stress can have a toxic effect on all elements of a personrsquos le ndash affecting work, home and relationships..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy may trigger post-traumatic stress  u study article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them. View the draft schedule of values at www.finance-ni.gov.uk reval--niIf ratepayers are unable to access the required information online they can contact LPS on Tel:   .

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
