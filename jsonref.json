Everyone else has lost faith in her ability to lead.\u0027 Mrs May agreed last December to step down before the next General Election, in a plea deal that saw her win a confidence vote of Tory MPs.The hapless duo of Transport Secretary Chris Grayling and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley - both of whom would be out of a job were Mrs May not in charge - are said to be her only remaining loyal ministers.Hardline Brexiteers have been calling for weeks for her to step down, saying they want one of their own to lead the next stage of negotiations with the EU.But now it seems that a wider swathe of the party feels that they are in the dying days of the May administration, with one of her own MPs saying that within months \u0027the only negotiations Theresa will be doing are how much she can get for an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off\u0027, according to the Guardian.Others see a shorter time frame with some Cabinet ministers reportedly discussing whether she should step down at the end of this week.Demonstrators protest outside the Royal Courts of Justice...Share this articleAnd there are a host of top Tories ready to step into her shoes whenever she finally decides that she can take the country - and the Conservative Party - no further.Here we look at the runners and riders, with their odds with Ladbrokes and how they voted in the 2016 referendum:Boris Johnson: The long-running thorn in May\u0027s side  who has recently had a \u0027prime ministerial\u0027 makeover          Boris Johnson has undergone a prime ministerial makeover  as Theresa May\u0027s days appeared increasingly numbered Former foreign secretary and mayor of LondonVoted leave and has become an increasingly hardline Brexiteer As likely to make headlines over his private lifeHas recently lost a lot of weight and smartened up his appearanceLeadership odds 41 The former foreign secretary who quit last July and has been tacitly campaigning for the leadership ever since returning to the backbenches with a regular stream of attacks on Mrs may and her Brexit strategy.Never far from the limelight it is his private life that has seen him most in the news recently after splitting from his wife Marina and embarking on a relationship with a former Conservative communications staffer 20 years his junior.But as an increasingly hawkish Brexiteer who says we should not be afraid of leaving without a deal he is hugely popular with the party faithful.In recently weeks he has further boosted his frontrunner credentials with what might be deemed a ‘prime ministerial’ makeover.He has lost weight and taming his unruly mop of blonde hair into something approaching the haircut of a serious senior statesman.Michael Gove: The boomerang cabinet minister who has a machiavellian reputation          Michael Gove, pictured in Downing Street today, has made a remarkable political comeback after being sacked by Theresa May in 2016Leading Vote Leave figure in 2016 who now backs PM\u0027s Brexit dealFormer journalist, 51,  who stood for leadership in 2016Was sacked as education minister by Theresa MayLater returned as Environment MinisterLeadship  odds 51A Brexiteer with a machiavellian reputation after the 2016 leadership campaign in which he first supported Boris Johnson for the leadership and then stood against him, to their mutual disadvantage.The former education secretary -  sacked by Mrs May -  was rehabilitated to become a right-on environment secretary - complete with reusable coffee cups and a strong line on food standards after Brexit.Despite being a former lead figure in the Vote Leave campaign alongside Mr Johnson the former journalist and MP for Surrey Heath has swung behind Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.But while he noisily supports the deal - he views the alternatives as worse he is quieter when it comes to supporting the Prime Minister and practically mute when it comes to her future.Seen as one of the Cabinet\u0027s strongest political thinkers and having stood once it is unthinkable that he would not stand again.Dominic Raab: Brexiteer who quit rather than back Mrs May\u0027s deal          Dominic Raab has become a cheerleader for a hard Brexit since stepping down as Brexit secretary in NovemberShortlived Brexit secretary last year, replacing David Davis in the hot seat But walked in November over terms agreed by PMVoted for Brexit in 2016Leadership odds 81 Mr Raab, 45, is another Vote Leave member who became Brexit secretary after David Davis quit alongside Mr Johnson last July over the Chequers plan.But he lasted just a matter of months before he too jumped ship, saying he could not accept the terms of the deal done by the Prime Minister.Like Mr Johnson and Mr Davis he has become an increasingly hardline Brexiteer, sharing a platform with the DUP\u0027s Arlene Foster and suggesting we should not be afraid of a no-deal Brexit.The Esher and Walton MP\u0027s decision to quit in November, boosted his popularity with party members but he lacks the wider popular appeal of Mr Johnson.And like Mr Johnson he might benefit from having quit the Cabinet at an earlier stage and dissociating himself with the dying days of the May administration. On Sunday he was asked on Sky News\u0027s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme if Mrs May would still be Prime Minister by Christmas, saying: \u0027I don\u0027t know. She has said she is going to step down. I would like to be able to see her do that in a way which is in terms of her own choosing.\u0027 And asked today if he’d like to be prime minister, he said: ‘Never say never.’ Sajid Javid: Remainer star who has run into trouble over knife crime and refugees          Sajid Javid has seen his stock take a hit in recent weeks over the knife crime crisis and migrants crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe most senior cabinet contenderVoted Remain but wants to see Brexit deliveredFaced criticism as Home Secretary But has taken a hard line on Shamima Begum case Leadership odds 81The Home Secretary, a Remainer who wants to see Brexit delivered, was the leading candidate from inside the Cabinet to replace Mrs May.After replacing Amber Rudd last year he consciously put clear ground between himself and the Prime Minister on issues like caps on skilled migrants after Brexit.But his credentials have taken a hit in recent weeks. He finds himself facing ongoing criticism of his handling of the knife crime crisis affecting UK cities, which sparked a cabinet row over funding for police.He also lost face over his handling of the influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in January, being seen to move slowly in realising the scale of the problem.But more recently the 49-year-old Bromsgove MP has made a serious of hardline decision designed to go down well with Tory voters.Most notably they have included moving to deprive London teenager turned Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, 19, of her British citizenship, after she was discovered among former Islamic State members in a Syrian refugee camp.Jeremy Hunt: Remainer turned Brexiteer unity candidate who wants to heal the party          Jeremy Hunt, a born-again Brexiteer after supporting Remain, is said to have been promoting himself as a unity candidate for a ided partyThe Foreign Secretary voted Remain But has become an increasingly vocal BrexiteerBacks May\u0027s dealHas approached ministers about running as a unity candidateLeadership odds 101 The Foreign Secretary who has undergone a Damascene conversion to the Brexit cause in with a series of hardline warnings to the EU.The 52-year-old South West Surrey MP is the most senior Cabinet minister in contention.He has reportedly been selling himself to colleagues as a unity candidate who can bring together the fractious Tory factions into something approaching a cohesive party.On Sunday he issued a stark warning to Tory MPs that they risk losing Brexit altogether if they fail to back Theresa May\u0027s deal in the crunch Commons vote on Tuesday.Mr Hunt said there was now \u0027wind in the sails\u0027 of the opponents of Brexit and that it would be \u0027devastating\u0027 for the Conservatives if they failed to deliver on their commitment to take Britain out of the EU.A long-serving health secretary, he replaced Mr Johnson as the UK\u0027s top diplomat and has won some plaudits over issues like the imprisonment of British mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran.But critics point to tub-thumpingly comparing the EU to the USSR at the party conference last year - which was very badly received in Brussels - and a gaffe in which he referred to his Chinese wife  as \u0027Japanese\u0027 as a reception in China.Nevertheless he is seen as a safe if uninspiring pair of hands.Andrea Leadsom: May\u0027s former leadership rival who has not let collective responsibility stop her speaking out          Ms Leadsom is a Brexiteer who frequently clashes with Speaker John BercowThe Commons\u0027 Leader challenged May in 2016Voted for Brexit Hosted Brexiteer \u0027pizza party\u0027 plot last year Increasingly outspoken BrexiteerLeadership odds 161 The Commons’ Leader stood against Mrs May for the party leadership in 2016 before conceding defeat before it was put to a vote of MPs.As collective responsibility has largely broken down among ministers she had been an increasingly vocal and clear Brexiteer voice in the Cabinet along line similar lines to Mr Johnson and Mr Raab.She was reportedly the host of a Brexiteer ‘pizza party’ in Parliament as the vying wings of the Cabinet plotted last year to shape the Brexit deal they wanted.In her role as Commons’ Leader she frequently clashes with Speaker John Bercow, something that will do her no harm among the Tory backbenches where he is widely loathed.Jacob Rees-Mogg: the old-fashioned Tory who led attempts to topple Mrs May but failed to remove her            Mr Rees-Mogg is a hardline Brexiteer but has suggested he could back a deal depending on what concessions Mrs May winsChairman of the European Research GroupWell-known for his old-fashioned mannerisms Led attempots to topple the PM last year but failedHas since suggested he could support a deal on the Irish backstop But only if the PM wins concessions from BrusselsLeadership odds 161 The leader of the European Research Group of Tory Brexiteers has an almost cult following.Known for his old-fashioned manners and clothing he played a lead role in attempts to topple Mrs May in December last year.Once the hardest of opponents to the Irish border backstop he has slightly thawed in his opposition in recent weeks.In the face of concern that Brexit could be delayed or stopped altogether he has hinted that he (and much of the ERG) could support a deal if Mrs May achieve certain concessions - which she has let to achieve.The Somerset MP has brushed off the chances of him running for the leadership but he remains a popular figure in the party, although some feel that he may be too eccentric.Amber Rudd: The former home secretary brought back to sort out benefits mess who became a Remainer rebel leader          Ms Rudd has emerged as the senior voice of Remainers in the Cabinet after her return to the top table of politicsHas publicly called for Brexit to be delayed in order to achieve a deal with BrusselsThe Hastings MP, 55, has refused to rule out resigning if the Government backs a no-deal BrexitMs Rudd was brought back into Government to sort out the benefits systemShe had quit as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal Leadership odds 201 Ms Rudd was forced to quit as Home Secretary last year over the Windrush scandal which saw British citizens, many of them old-aged pensioners, wrongly sent ‘back’ to foreign countries they had left as small children.She was brought back as Work and Pensions Secretary after Esther McVey quit, with the dubious honour of having to sort out the widely criticised Universal Credit system.Since then the Hastings MP has found herself at the heart of a Remainer cell in the heart of the Cabinet.Last month she linked up with Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark to call for a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be hammered out by March 29.She has also consistently refused to rule out resigning if the Government decided to go for a no-deal Brexit.It’s unlikely she could get much support among the Brexiteer wing of the party.David Davis: The confident Brexit bulldog with an eye on the top prize          The former Brexit secretary does not lack confidence but may struggle to get the backing of large numbers of MPs or the Tory membershipFormer Brexit secretary turned opponent of Theresa MayWas the first top level minister to quit last JulyBrexiteer who has made no secret of his desire to lead the party, aged 70 Leadership odds 201 As Brexit secretary David Davis was lampooned by opponents as the ‘Brexit bulldog’ who oozed confidence if not ability.Mr Davis was the first minister to make a Brexit-themed jump from Mrs May’s ship Government last July, followed by his deputy Steve Baker and then by Mr Johnson.Since then he has followed them into a position of extreme Brexiteer opposition to her strategic direction, talking down the risks of no-deal and arguing the Uk needs to take a firmer line with the EU in order to get concessions.Not short of self-believe, when asked last month by Tatler if he had the right credentials to be leader he replied: ‘Yes. And if this were an application for a job as a chief executive, I would probably win it.‘But it isn’t. And that isn’t the way the decision is done.’ Penny Mordaunt: The highly regarded Brexiteer trying to carve out a niche in international development          Ms Mordaunt is an outsider for the leadership but is highly thought of in Brexiteer groupsThe MP for Portsmouth North is a Royal Navy reservistHighly regarded in Brexiteer circles She has been consistently tipped to quit over Brexit but remains in the Cabinet Has come up with ideas to change the way foreign aid is spent Leadership odds 331 The International Development Secretary is an outside bet but is highly regarded in Brexiteer circles. The Royal Navy reservist, 46, has attempted to carve out a niche at International Development with some eye-catching suggests about changing how the UK spends disperses aid cash.Last month the Portsmouth North MP demanded a major overhaul so less of the UK\u0027s £14.1billion aid budget was handed out through staff at international agencies.She wants to use the cash to fund specific projects chosen by Britain with more oversight to make sure money is not wasted.Over the last few months she has been at the heart of persistent rumours that she will be the next Brexit-supporting minister out the door over Brexit.She has so far remained in the Cabinet but there is little time remaining for any ministers considering their position to make the change, so expect the rumours to continue as Brexit approaches.‘Next negotiation will be for Bake Off’: Tory MPs suggest PM’s days are numbered | Politics | The GuardianMinister claims \u0027only two\u0027 Cabinet members support Theresa May as she faces growing pressure to quit over BrexitDavid Davis, the Conservative Party’s self-styled secret weapon | Tatler"},{"url":null,"title":"Cameron insists backs Mays plan partnership EU","story":"    David Cameron (pictured today in London) warned MPs not to let Britain crash out of the EU today as Theresa May faces catastrophe over BrexitMr Cameron said: \u0027I support the Prime Minister and I think she is doing the right thing seeking a partnership deal with the EU, that\u0027s the right approach.The reason I don\u0027t give lots of interviews and answer lots of questions about this is because her job is hard enough already without her immediate predecessor giving a running a commentary.\u0027So I wish her well.\u0027Asked about no deal as he walked off, Mr Cameron said: \u0027I don\u0027t think no deal is a good idea at all.\u0027 May CALLS OFF last-minute dash to Brussels after late-night...David Davis says failing to deliver on the referendum will...Share this articleMrs May was today urged to delay her Brexit doomsday vote in the Commons tomorrow after she again failed to make any breakthrough in negotiations with the EU and called off an 11th-hour trip to Brussels.The Prime Minister had her plane on standby but after a phone call with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker last night she cancelled plans to fly out to Europe as the deadlock continues.

Many more have passed away inside the sprawling camp, which is struggling to handle the unexpectedly high numbers arriving. Al-Hol has doubled in size to 62,000 people in less than a month.As a consequence, Begum and Jarrah were moved a week ago with some other female foreign recruits to Roj, a smaller camp near the Iraqi border.The British teenager married Yago Riedijk, a Dutch fighter, ten days after arriving in IS\u0027s self-declared caliphate.

She has also banned crisps and fruit juice A headteacher has banned children from bringing sweets in on their birthday but insists she is \u0027not the fun police\u0027. Chasey Crawford-Usher has also prohibited crisps and fruit juice from her school, Wateringbury Primary School in Kent.The American-born teacher says she imposed the ban after being shocked by how much sugar British children were consuming.The self-confessed health fanatic insists the move is in the best interests of pupils.She said: \u0027First of all, I\u0027m not the headteacher of all evil and saying no.\u0027I\u0027ve banned birthday sweets because they were becoming a huge problem in the school and meant the children were consuming processed sugar almost every day.\u0027Mrs Crawford-Usher, from New England, America, admits she wasn\u0027t allowed sweets growing up and claims her mother was a \u0027wholefoods mum before it was trendy.\u0027She added: \u0027The most important reason for banning the practice was my growing awareness of the amount of sugar being consumed and the number of children in our school that were undergoing tooth extraction and also just had really serious tooth decay.\u0027My view is that things have changed today and the amount of sugar children consume is out of all proportion to what they should be eating - and therefore the tradition is no longer acceptable.\u0027Ms Crawford-Usher said the practice is unfair to mums and dads who do not want their children tucking into unhealthy snacks which \u0027sets up conflict at every level.\u0027          Parents of children who attend Wateringbury Primary School were angry with the change and one mother said Ms Crawford-Usher was \u0027Britain\u0027s most miserable headteacher\u0027 She said: \u0027A few parents came to me and explained the amount of pressure they were under to comply with this tradition even though they disagreed with it.\u0027It sets up conflict at every level - the whole thing is just a nightmare for schools, and a nightmare for parents.\u0027The playground was often covered in litter from children leaving school and dropping their sweet wrappers on this floor.When the birthday tradition was first banned, Ms Crawford-Usher faced a backlash from parents who thought they were being \u0027cruel and unsympathetic\u0027 to children.But the headteacher said she has since seen a real difference at the school where the playground is now litter free.She said: \u0027Immediately a number of parents thought I was being cruel and unsympathetic and I tried to explain that I had to make a policy that was going to put everybody on an equal playing field.\u0027The children quickly accept rules that have a strong reason for them.\u0027I\u0027m all for children questioning rules and discussing them because they\u0027ve got a point of view, and if I can explain a clear reason they accept it.\u0027It\u0027s really important that parents understand that we\u0027ve got the children\u0027s well being at heart - it\u0027s not because I don\u0027t like sweets.\u0027But parents reacted angrily to the rule.One Kent mother said: \u0027She\u0027s the most miserable headteacher in Britain.\u0027  Ms Crawford-Usher noted that children are provided with healthy and wholesome school dinners such as spaghetti bolognese, shepherd\u0027s pie and roast dinners - all made with fresh ingredients.The strict head also said desserts were on the table but they too were natural and unprocessed.           The ban comes after recent figures revealed 13,000 children under five needed tooth extractions last yearShe said: \u0027Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school.\u0027The dental problems among schoolchildren now are awful and I want to do what I can to prevent it.\u0027It\u0027s a terribly traumatic ordeal for a child to have their tooth extracted and it\u0027s something I want to avoid.\u0027It comes after recent figures revealed 13,000 children under five needed tooth extractions last year.Public Health England estimated that youngsters were eating around eight more cubes of sugar per day than the recommended guidelines.Mrs Crawford-Usher\u0027s decision has come under fire on social media from Olympic race walker Tom Bosworth.He said: \u0027Again, common sense needs to be used here.

Was this not spag bol I saw before me? And, if not, what would my children eat for tea?As the meat turned from dark crimson to light tan, I sought advice. ‘Um, kids, any idea as to the contents of this pan?’ Both looked up, sighed theatrically and returned to wrestling with the dog.‘It’s spaghetti bolognese. Obviously,’ muttered my daughter, 11, while my son, just nine, rolled his eyes and nodded.Yup, thought so. I boiled away the red wine, threw in a great splodge of tomato puree, turned the heat to a simmer and retired to the sofa in triumph. The nation’s ‘Official Favourite Dish’ (according to a 2018 survey) does exist.Now, I get Mayor Virginio Merola’s point. Ragu alla Bolognese is a classic dish from northern Italy, in which a slow-cooked meat sauce called ragu (made with either beef or a mix of beef and pork) meets fresh tagliatelle pasta.          The mayor called the popular pasta dish \u0027fake news\u0027 and has nothing to do with his home town of Bologna There are strict rules as to what goes in, although — this being Italy — no one agrees what they are.Spag bol, on the other hand, is basically mince with onions and tomato. Plus everything from ketchup to garlic, basil, carrots, thyme, Marmite, chocolate, coffee granules, Worcestershire sauce and chilli. It’s served with dried spaghetti.No wonder the Mayor called the British dish ‘fake news’. We’ve been here before: a couple of years ago, the late, great chef Antonio Carluccio claimed that Brits had ruined ragu by adding herbs. And Mary Berry ran into trouble by using white wine (which I have seen in ‘authentic’ recipes from Bologna) and double cream for her version.But I get the feeling that the Mayor’s outburst last weekend was cynically calculated to stir up controversy. It’s a reliable trick: when no one’s paying you much attention as Mayor of Bologna, drag out the old spag bol spat and let battle recommence. Mayor of Bologna says he\u0027s sick of tourists ordering...Which posh nosh IS worth the dosh? Ocado\u0027s dumping of...Share this article I admit spaghetti bolognese, as we know it in this country, is about as authentically Bolognese as I am. Some say Italian emigrants invented it in America, others that those same immigrants created it in Soho, London, in the Fifties.But, more than a cross-cultural hybrid, spag bol soothes and delights, a taste of childhood that resonates deep into adult life.Just as T.S. Eliot’s J. Alfred Prufrock measures out his life in coffee spoons, so I chart my ever-advancing years (I’m 44) in tales of spaghetti bolognese. I’ve probably eaten it more than any other dish: even more than burgers and hot dogs (both immigrant dishes, too).It was a staple of my youth, made from good butcher’s mince by my mother, with little else other than a chopped onion and squeeze of Sainsbury’s tomato puree. Inauthentically, there was always more sauce than pasta. (In Italy, pasta is daintily anointed, not drowned.)Worse, it was finished with lashings of that dusty, foul-smelling cheese-powder that came in a cardboard cylinder and would probably have emerged unscathed from a nuclear war.          Camilla Parker Bowles served her own take on spaghetti bolognese - mince with a chopped onion and Sainsbury\u0027s tomato pureeNot that that bothered us two ravenous children, faced with the tea to beat them all.Simple, but by God we loved it. Just as we adored the stuff on holiday in southern Italy. Not for us the zuppa di cozze (mussel soup) and oozingly lactic burrata cheese, nor spaghetti con vongole (clams) or the baked pasta dish, Sformato Ferdinando. Nope, for my sister, me and my cousins, it was spaghetti bolognese. With chips. Every lunch and dinner. For two weeks.Back in London, and lunch with my grandmother in old-fashioned trattorias like Mimmo D’Ischia on Elizabeth Street and La Fontana on the Pimlico Road (both now gone the way of all flesh).We might have tried an occasional grilled veal paillard. But, really, the waiters never needed to ask. Spaghetti bolognese, per favore. And molto, molto parmesan.They knew Brits liked it with mince rather than a slow-cooked hunk of beef. And that was fine. For most Italians, regional authenticity is important — but so, too, are generosity and good manners. Give the children what they want.At prep school, I found out how deranged this dish could be —onions, hideously burnt while still somehow raw, mixed with ketchup and mince that was grey, gristled and greasy. That wasn’t food: it was the definition of dyspeptic disgust.Forced through the grinder of British institutional eating in the Seventies and Eighties, it had no chance. But it’s a dish I continued to cook throughout my life. Student stand-by, saviour of the dreary dinner party, a crucial Cupid’s arrow in the search for true love.As I grew older, the ingredients got better, but if you could chop an onion and turn on a gas ring, you were halfway there. It was slow-cooked succour, seasoned with nostalgia and greed. These days I add sliced pancetta and, whisper it, chicken livers, garlic and even double cream. Because this is my spag bol, and this is the way I make it.The recipe my children so adore may be nearer to a classic ragu alla Bolognese. But I still serve it with spaghetti, swamped in sauce, and covered in a blizzard of parmesan — albeit freshly grated.So no, Signore Mayor, this is not a Bolognan dish. It never has been — and you knew that all along. But it does exist here as a true domestic classic, homage and hybrid at once. A dish unbound by formal strictures, and all the better for it.Spag bol may have no place in Bologna. But in Britain, it’s a true taste of home.

Photograph: Neil HallEPASiptu members in Dublin Fire Brigade have called for a full inspection of Celtic Tiger properties following revelations about an audit of 60 apartment blocks which revealed serious fire safety issues.In a statement on Monday, the Siptu workers said that properties built or extended from around the year 2000 to 2014 should be subject to a full risk assessment “due to the large number of fire-safety issues discovered in a recent survey of apartment blocks constructed during this period”.On Monday The  reported that Keenan Property Management (KPM) had found issues in almost all of the 60 apartment blocks it had surveyed in Ireland following the Grenfell tower fire tragedy. The company, one of the largest property managers in the State, said it found inadequate and outdated fire alarm systems and a lack of fire stopping throughout buildings. Commenting on the report, Siptu organiser Brendan O’Brien said it was “stark, but unfortunately, not an unexpected finding”. ‘Light-touch regulation’He commended the company for its approach and said “local authorities need to show the same degree of concern and undertake a similar survey of all commercial, leisure, nursing and hospital buildings constructed or extended during the period when so-called ‘light-touch regulation’ was at its most extreme”.KPM also criticised the management of apartment complexes through so-called Owners’ Management Companies (OMCs), comprised of residents. These often lacked the skill and expertise needed to deal with serious legacy issues from the boom years, KPM said. In a statement, the Apartment Owners’ Network (AON) advocacy group said that supports for those OMCs facing defects and fire safety issues needed to be improved. “They are volunteers, acting in their spare time,” the group said. It called for supports for OMCs along the lines of those offered in Canada and Australia to be introduced, where finances are tested, directors are offered training and the companies are regulated by the government.Management model“Ireland needs similar oversight. After all, OMCs are responsible for the stewardship of billions of euro worth of property assets,” it said. “The current model of apartment management doesn’t need to be discarded, it needs reform, before there is an Irish Grenfell.”Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said he had written to Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy following The  report and another in the Sunday Business Post, which stated that developers were successful in overturning planning conditions requested by Dublin Fire Brigade 75 per cent of the time.“We want the Minister to explain why it is that recommendations from the fire brigade aren’t being addressed but also the broader issue of fire safety. Crucially he needs to make it clear that the single most important thing here is fire safety and that is important above all else,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Northern Secretary seeks to \u0026lsquocorrect the record\u0026rsquo over remarks on actions of soldiersCertificate of honour from US city recognises ex-Sinn F\u0026eacutein politician\u0026rsquos service in the militaryEx-president says institution prizes the clerical male above women, truth, and abused childrenResidents\u0026rsquo quality of life improving, Hiqa foundResidents had to leave Crampton Building flats for a time due to blaze in restaurantEfforts under way to return remains of Giselle and Allison Marimon-HerreraDublin Fire Brigade Siptu members call for full inspection to avoid Grenfell-type tragedyDublin ballots to be taken to from polling centres to RDS, separated and then counted at CitywestINMO says proposal, which led to suspension of recent strikes, would make jobs \u0026lsquoinsecure\u0026rsquoTen people killed by British soldiers during violence in west Belfast in August 1971Women affected by non-disclosure of audit expected to get about \u0026euro25,000 eachFocus Ireland urging people to hold May bank holiday events to raise fundsGarda\u0026iacute found John Doyle (38), who has 111 previous convictions, trying to hideKildare County Council is due to make a decision on the Intel application before the end of this monthSentencing hearing for three men who admitted impeding prosecution of killers"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3821583.1552333897!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"met %C3%A9ireann issues orange weather alert as storm gareth approaches ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTuesday will be an extremely windy day across the country.

So it should probably have been Ukexit but Brexit trips off the tongue better.Peter Wilding, the managing director of the British Influence think tank, is credited with coining the term Brexit. Wilding was former Conservative party leader David Cameron’s media and policy director of the Conservative Party in the EU from 2005 to 2008.Wilding, who campaigned for the UK to remain within the EU, first used the phrase in 2012 before it was first used publicly by Cameron. Brexit is a first cousin, once removed, of Grexit, which was used to describe Greece’s possible departure from the euro zone during the economic crisis.David who? David Cameron is the former Conservative Party leader and British prime minister. He romped home with a big majority in 2015 riding a wave of a promise he gave to Tory hardliners to hold an inout referendum on the UK’s membership of the European Union. The feeling is\u0026nbspneither he, nor anyone else, really believed the vote would pass. His election victory is now a distant memory. Cameron is rarely seen but is sometimes spotted avoiding members of the media as he jumps into a black Range Rover. Or as Eastenders star Danny Dyer put it, Cameron, who he labelled a “twat”, was in France “with his trotters up” while everybody else was dealing with the Brexit calamity.Theresa May - Ok, so unless you’ve been living under a large rock with no wifi, you’ll know that Theresa May is the Conservative Party leader and current British prime minister. At least as long as nobody else on the planet wants the job. She became British prime minister\u0026nbspin July 2016 in the wake of the Brexit vote and the resignation of Cameron. May who will be 63 in October 2019, was first elected an MP for Maidenhead in 1997 and served as British home secretary (basically, our minister for justice) from 2010 to 2016.Article 50 - This is the “get out clause” of the Treaty of Lisbon. It grants an EU member state the power to quit the bloc unilaterally. Once triggered, it gives the departing country two years to negotiate an exit deal. Theresa May triggered the UK’s exit on March 29th, 2017, scheduling Brexit for 11pm on March 29th, 2019, and starting the countdown clock. A European Court of Justice ruling has said the UK can unilaterally withdraw its article 50 application but extending it, thereby postponing the exit, would require unanimous agreement from the European Council, the group of EU heads of state and government.The Withdrawal Agreement - This is the deal reached in November 2018 between May and the European Union on the terms under which Britain would exit the EU. Also known as the “WA”, the “orce deal” and “Theresa May’s deal” it includes a transition period of two years (and possibly longer) after Britain leaves when not much would change. It also contains a provision called the backstop that will kick in to keep the Irish Border open in the event that trading and border arrangements sufficient to achieve this aren’t reached during the transition period.Apart from the backstop, the key issues it covers are the mutual rights of EU and UK citizens now living in each other’s territory and the UK’s financial obligations to the EU (often referred to the the “orce bill”). It is not yet ratified as it is facing strong opposition in the House of Commons. The European Parliament also needs to approve it.The Political Declaration - This is a separate document also agreed in November 2018 between the two sides setting out how they hoped the future relationship will develop in key areas including trade, political and security co-operation and so on. Unlike the withdrawal agreement, this is a political (not a legal) document. So it could be tweaked to try to bring the UK parliament on side.Backstop: The backstop, part of the withdrawal agreement, is a kind of insurance policy that will kick in to ensure that there is no hard border in Ireland, no matter what the outcome is of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The agreement involves a transition period, a kind of standstill when most current arrangements would apply until the end of 2020, at least. It can be extended up to the end of 2022. If a trade deal between the EU and UK is not finalised in this time or is not far-reaching enough to ensure that no border checks are needed, then the backstop kicks in. It would involve the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU and the North also sticking to some of the rules and regulations set down in the EU single market. Both sides say they want to avoid using the backstop, or if it is triggered to ensure this only happens for a short period. The term comes from cricket it is a fielding position where the backstop stands behind the wicket-keeper to stop the ball reaching the boundary and prevent the batting team from scoring should the wicket-keeper miss it.Transition period: This is the standstill period which would start immediately the UK leaves on March 29th under the withdrawal agreement. The UK would remain in the EU trading bloc - as a member of the single market and customs union and the rights of business and citizens would remain. The transition period - sometimes referred to by the UK government as the implementation period - would last at least until December 2020. There is scope to extend it until December 2022, at the latest. Brexit supporters don’t like it as it would keep the UK tied to EU laws, but with no say in how these are changed.No-deal Brexit: This means the UK leaving at the end of March- or at some later date if an extension is agreed - without the withdrawal agreement being ratified. This would mean that all the UK’s legal links to the EU would end overnight, new trading rules and regulatory regimes would come into effect immediately. It has led to warnings of economic chaos for the UK and Ireland and more widely in some sectors such as car manufacturing.The EU Single Market - The body of rules, regulations and practices designed to allow free movement of people, capital, goods and services across the EU.The EU Customs Union - The agreement that goods can move freely within the EU with no tariffs, or special import taxes, being applied as they move from one country to another. It also involves common agreed tariff levels on goods coming into the union from outside - meaning that once they enter the EU they too can also circulate freely.Brexit lingo - the everyday phrases\u0026nbspBrexiters - these are simply people in favour of Brexit. Brexiteers are Brexiters, but not necessarily the other way around.Brexiteers - If Brexit and the Three Musketeers had a love child it would be a Brexiteer. The term is used to describe those who are fervently in favour of Brexit to the point, perhaps, where they would carry a sword to make their point. Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson are Brexiteers, although we are in no way suggesting they would resort to violence to further their cause.Arch Brexiteer- A Brexiteer with a cherry on top, imagine if Jacob Rees-Mogg or Boris Johnson had a love child with the Incredible Hulk’s angry sister.Remainer - Somebody who voted against the UK leaving the European Union. Can sometimes be heard apologising to the Irish nation on radio and television news programmes or sitting in tears in a hipster cafe in central London reading Fintan O’Toole’s latest  column.Remoaner - A derogatory term used by Brexiters, Brexiteers or Arch Brexiteers to describe a Remainer. Calling someone a remoaner is up there with calling your female work colleague a nag.Red Lines - Issues where compromise is not an option. Everyone from the Democratic Unionist Party to the Dublin Government to the British government to the Conservative party hardliners to the European Union itself have their own favourite red lines. There are so many red lines, it very quickly after June 2016 began to look like a big bowl of spaghetti and red pesto. There is a lot of talk now, in particular, about whether Theresa May will move any of her “red lines” to try the break the logjam and win House of Commons support for her deal.Strong and stable - British prime minister Theresa May called a snap election in April 2017 saying the UK needed a “strong and stable” government because of Brexit. It is an expression she would live to regret after she lost her majority and was forced to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The DUP are among the most vociferously opposed to the withdrawal agreement Theresa May negotiated with the EU and to the backstop. The institutions expected to guarantee strong and stable society in the UK and other democracies are now very weak and unstable.Brino or Bino - “Brexit in name only” is the position the United Kingdom might find itself in if it were to leave the EU on terms dictated to it whereby the country must align itself to such an extent that it would operate in almost the same fashion as if it were inside the EU. So it would have left the European Union but would be still subject to the same trading rules and legal obligations. Bino is the worst case scenario for those who want Brexit.Irexit - A second cousin of both Brexit and Grexit, this describes Ireland’s exit from the European Union, which of course if very unlikely to happen any time in the near future. The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows Irish people to be more than happy with EU membership, notwithstanding our relationship with European authorities during the economic crash.Regrexit: The feeling of regret and guilt for voting in favour of Brexit. The phenomenon was felt as soon as the morning after the vote in June 2016 as it is thought many voted for Brexit as a protest against other issues with the assumption it would not pass. Doh!Nebulous - What Theresa May accused European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker of calling her during a Brussels showdown in December. That’s according to lip-readers. He was calling “the British position” nebulous, he insisted. The whole episode was caught on camera and the entire world collectively wished Mammy and Daddy would stop arguing. Explaining the episode afterwards May said: “I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker. I think that’s the sort of discussion you’re able to have when you’ve developed a working relationship and you work together. And what came out of that was his clarity that when he used that particular phrase he’d been talking about the general level of debate. I had further conversations with him through the morning,” she said.Nebulous (2) - Lady Sylia Hermon described the proposals in an amendment supported by Theresa May’s government to come up with an “alternative” to the backstop as nebulous.Hard border - This refers to the situation where border checkpoints by police andor soldiers would be erected to regulate the movement of people and goods between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue to be in the EU and Northern Ireland, which will remain in the UK and therefore outside the European Union. The idea strikes fear into the hearts of most people on the island of Ireland and many in Britain given how much a target border infrastructure was for paramilitaries during the Troubles. Not to mention the disruption a hard border would cause to everyday life in border communities. The backstop was set up specifically to avoid the hard border.Soft or frictionless border - This describes how the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland operates now. People can move freely back and forth without even knowing which jurisdiction they are in. Think leaving Forkhill to visit your Aunty Mary in Dundalk without getting stopped by a soldier to ask what’s in the boot of your car. Goods can move freely too, with no hindrance or checks, though there are police operations against smuggling.The buzzwords\u0026nbspSecond referendum - This is a mechanism deployed in Ireland several times, designed to allow people who feel regrexit to have another bite at the cherry. Those who want a second vote say the electorate was led down the garden path the first time around, while those against it say the people have already spoken. If a second referendum were to be held it remains unclear which side would win. Remember that snap UK election Theresa May called in 2017 seeking a strong mandate from the people? They ended up with a lame duck administration propped up by the arch-Brexiteer Democratic Unionist Party. Dealing with the electorate is like trying to herd cats - anything could happen.Unless and until - The phrase used many, many times, to describe how long the provisions of the backstop would stay in place, i.e. unless or until there is an agreement that ensures no hard border in Ireland. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has been saying it at the drop of a hat. For Brexiters, Brexiteers and arch Brexiteers it is the proverbial nails on the Brexit blackboard.Time-limited backstop - A key problem in the UK parliament with the backstop plan is that – after the transition period – it commits the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU until another solution is found to the Irish border issue. For this reason there are demands to put a time-limit on the backstop. However, for Ireland and the EU this goes against the “ unless and until” commitment.Alternative arrangements - The UK argues that there are other ways to control goods flowing across the Irish border, apart from physical infrastructure. And so these are alternatives to the backstop . These include advanced customs processes and the use of specialist technology to monitor the movement of goods. The EU has promised in the draft withdrawal agreement to assess alternatives to the backstop with the UK, but has pointed out that there is no border anywhere between two trading zones where some checks do not take place .Maxfac - Maximum facilitation or “maxfac” is a phrase often used by Brexiteers to describe the idea that technology and customs processes can be used to avoid a hard border with infrastructure.The Malthouse Proposal - a plan which has found support in the Conservative Party late in the day, for the UK to exit the EU and replace the backstop with a free-trade deal with the EU combined with the use of technology to do away with customs checks. It also proposes to extend the standstill transition period until the end of 2021. It sounds like it was dreamt up in a pub but in fact it was brokered by housing minister Kit Malthouse.SoftSofter Brexit - It had been thought that Theresa May, following the rejection of her original deal in the House of Commons, might try to reach agreement on a softer version of Brexit. A softer Brexit would mean the UK remaining more closely aligned to EU rules and regulations and probably also remaining in a customs union with the EU. However there has as yet been no effort to reach this kind of deal with Labour, whose support May would need to get this over the line in the House of Commons.Canada ++ - This is the idea that the UK would end up, after Brexit, in a free trade deal with the EU similar to the one completed with Canada but hopefully involving an even closer relationship (hence, plus, or plus plus). The trading arrangements between the two sides are only due to be negotiated after Brexit takes place. If there is a no-deal Brexit and no agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves, it is not clear what the options will be for future negotiations.Norway - A Scandinavian country’s name but also used to describe the way Norway trades and relates to the European Union. The Norway model might be considered Bino by Brexiters as it would involve staying in the EU single market and subject to its rules (though overseen by a separate court). Norway-plus is sometimes used to refer to a Norway-style deal with additional membership of a customs union with the EU. This would solve the Irish Border problem but would be too close a relationship for the Brexiteers.WTO rules - If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, then it will trade with the EU and everyone else – on the basis of rules set down by the World Trade Organisation. This would involve tariffs, or special import taxes, on goods moving in and out of the UK to EU and third country markets. The UK would hope to maintain existing trade links, negotiated by the EU, with many other countries and also to do a future trade deal with the EU. There is debate on whether, immediately after leaving, the UK would immediately invoke WTO rules. It is meant to deal with all countries with which it does not have a trade deal the same, but enforcement of this is via a long drawn-out disputes process.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Peter MorrisonAPTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said it is “far too late” in the Brexit process for the United Kingdom to tell the European Union what it wants as part of an exit deal.Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar was also dismissive of suggestions that British prime minister Theresa May may further postpone a vote on the Brexit withdrawal agreement that is due to take place in the House of Commons this week.Mrs May is battling to save her Brexit strategy as negotiations with the European Union remain “deadlocked”, amid warnings that the prime minister is heading for another crushing defeat in Tuesday’s crunch Commons vote.Tory Brexiteers said rejection of the withdrawal agreement is “inevitable” unless Mrs May is able to secure significant changes to the Northern Ireland backstop. “Technical” talks between officials took place in Brussels over the weekend and the PM spoke to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Sunday night. But a Downing Street source said the negotiations remained “deadlocked”.Speculation in London has suggested Mrs May could replace the so-called meaningful vote with another vote which would allow MPs show what type of Brexit they would find acceptable.The Taoiseach said such a prospect “really misses the point”.“I do hear some suggestion that the votes may be called off in favour of a new vote as a result of which the House of Commons would tell the European Union what they want. That really misses the point,” Mr Varadkar told reporters. “We’re two and half years if not three years since the referendum. It is far too late for the United Kingdom to tell us what they want. The withdrawal agreement requires a compromise and this withdrawal agreement is already a compromise.”“Obviously the first step on Tuesday is the next vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons. That may pass or it may not pass, I can’t predict the outcome of that vote but if it doesn’t pass I understand there will be a vote on Wednesday to take no-deal off the table and potentially a vote on Thursday then around an extension.”The remaining 27 European Union members will have to agree to grant an extension of the negotiating period beyond Brexit day on March 29th, if one is requested by London. The Taoiseach said it has to be an “extension with a purpose”.“I think if there is going to be an extension. It has to be an extension with a purpose. Nobody across the European Union wants to see a rolling cliff edge where tough decisions just get put off until the end of April and then to the end of May and then maybe until the end of July.“The uncertainty around Brexit is already worrying citizens. It is damaging business confidence, it is effecting our agriculture in particular. It will affect other industries as well as the week goes on. I really think if there is going to be an extension it has to be with a purpose, that extension.”The threat of a no-deal Brexit is not one “that the European Union or Ireland is making”, he added.“The 29th March is a self imposed deadline and the United Kingdom parliament can take the threat of no deal — for Ireland, for Northern Ireland, for Britain, for Europe — off the table at any time.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Tolga AKMENAFPGetty ImagesWe are only weeks away from\u0026nbspMarch 29th, the date on which, at 11pm our time, the UK is due to leave the EU.If you decided to tune out for the last few months, the good news is that you haven’t missed much, at least in terms of decisions. There has been lots of noise, but little clarity on what is going to happen.It is still not clear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal, or whether March 29th will, in fact, be Brexit day, or whether there will be some extension.This was not the plan. The terms of which the UK were to withdraw were to all have been agreed by now.The failure – so far – to conclude the withdrawal throws everything up into the air.The UK House of Commons has so far not approved the deal negotiated between the EU and UK, with British prime minister Theresa May’s government looking for concessions to try to get it through. Another vote on this is due on Tuesday and there are last minute attempts to agree changes which would allow more MPs to support the agreement.Here are the key questions to be answered.1 Will the UK leave the EU on March 29th?This is very debatable. If there is some breakthrough in the talks and the House of Commons does approve the withdrawal agreement then more time will almost certainly be needed for the UK government to pass the necessary legislation. This could delay the exit by a couple of months – a so-called technical extension. But right now no route to Commons approval is evident and Theresa May is believed to be considering in what form Tuesday’s vote will be put to the Commons.If there is no breakthrough, then the UK may ask for an extension of the article-50 process – the rules for a country leaving the EU. The suggestion is that it could ask for an additional two or three months. This would have to be agreed unanimously by the EU side, which may look for some indication of how the UK hopes to break the deadlock. In other words, they will not want to give an extension just for the sake of it. There have even been suggestions that some EU states favour a longer extension. There has as yet been no formal EU discussion on this as no request has been made by the UK.If no extension is granted, and no withdrawal agreement is finalised, then the UK will leave on March 29th with no deal. It is also possible that an extension in the UK’s leaving date is agreed, say until the end of June, and failure to reach a deal in the interim leads to a no-deal exit at that stage.In short, pretty much anything can still happen.2 What is the difference between an exit with a deal and one without?If a withdrawal agreement is finalised then once the UK leaves it would enter what is called “a transition period”, lasting until at least December 2020, with a possible extension of up to two years.It would have left the EU, but existing arrangements would remain in place, meaning not much would change. This would be to give time to work out what would happen next in terms of trade and other relationships between the EU and UK. So an exit with a deal would still leave a lot to be worked out, but would mean little practical change in the short term – except that the UK would no longer participate in EU institutions.For Ireland it would remove the immediate economic threat and also the huge political problems which a no-deal would cause, particularly in relation to the Border.A no-deal exit, on the other hand, would sever the UK’s links with the EU overnight. This would create immediate upheaval in areas such as trade, with potential delays in ports in France, the UK and Ireland in particular, as new customs and regulatory checks are introduced overnight.These delays would ease as new procedures are worked out. But other impacts would be long-lasting and serious. Irish exporters would face new bureaucracy and, in some cases, tariffs, making it harder to sell into the UK market. Parts of our food industry, particularly the beef sector, could be priced out of the UK market overnight, or face new competition from low-cost producers in South America.Tariffs on goods coming in here from the UK would push up prices, particularly in areas such as consumer foods. The Central Bank has said that a no-deal Brexit could cost out economy 4 per cent of GDP in the first year.A no-deal exit would also lead to immediate pressure on the Irish Government to check goods passing through the Irish Border and thus into the EU single market. The Government has said that, in the case of a no-deal Brexit, urgent talks would be needed with the EU and UK to avoid this. Ireland might be given some leeway, but it is not clear how border checks could be avoided under EU rules. The UK is unlikely to agree to the alternative – checking goods as they cross the Irish Sea – as this has been a key point in dispute in the talks.The potential chaos and uncertainties of a no-deal Brexit have led everyone to assume a way will be found to avoid it. So far this has not happened.3. What happens next?The House of Commons is due to vote on the withdrawal agreement again on Tuesday. The UK government had promised the vote will go ahead. Theresa May is seeking to negotiate last minute changes, heading to Strasbourg on Monday evening.\u0026nbspIf the existing withdrawal agreement is passed, at some stage, then the UK leaves with a deal and enters the transition.If the Commons does not approve the withdrawal agreement, then two further votes have been promised. Again it remains to be seen how this plays out, if prime minister changes her approach on the first vote.The first, due on Wednesday, would be on whether MPs support a no-deal exit. The second would be on whether they support an extension to the article 50 process. A majority against a no deal would be expected. MPs might be expected to support an extension, though it remains to be seen whether agreement can be found on how long they want it to last.The EU side has to agree to an extension of article 50 – unanimously. And so just because the Commons supports it does not mean it will happen, certainly without some conditions attached, or with EU input into how long it lasts. This could all come to a head at the EU Summit on March 20th-21st, just over a week before the date Brexit is due.Talk about cutting it fine.4. And what are the key issues in the talks?It has come down to one thing: the backstop.This is the measure designed to guarantee that whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the EU and UK, a hard border will never return on the island of Ireland.Opposition has grown to the backstop plan among Conservative MPs and the DUP, despite changes to the original proposal during negotiators. Crucially, the UK attorney general Geoffrey Cox has ruled that the UK might not be able to escape from this arrangement and political opposition has focused on the risk of being “ trapped” in the backstop. MPs oppose this because it would leave the entire UK in a customs union with the EU and the North even more closely aligned with the EU, with no guarantee on when this might end. Under an alternative plan, just the North would remain aligned, but this, too, is opposed.So the talks in Brussels\u0026nbspand now Strasbourg have focused on trying to provide some reassurances to the UK that the EU does not intend the backstop to be permanent, and ideally hopes it will never have to be used. However, while the EU side is willing to provide statements of intent,and legal guarantees on how an arbitration process would work, the UK is still seeking something which would effectively allow it to decide itself to leave the backstop or put some time limit on it. Crucially, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox needs to be able to change his earlier advice that the UK could remain stuck indefinitely in a customs union with the EU.The EU side argue that the whole point of the backstop is that it stays in place unless and until some other way is found to avoid a hard Irish border.\u0026nbspAnd so the conversation has gone around in circles. As the countdown continues, there is one last attempt underway to try to find a way forward. It remains to be seen if it is enough.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Tom HonanPA Wire.British cabinet office minister David Lidington has told MPs that “legally-binding changes” that “strengthen and improve” the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration have been secured. He was speaking in the House of Commons as his prime minister Theresa May met senior EU officials in Strasbourg for talks aimed at securing an improved deal before Tuesday’s crucial second House of Commons vote on the withdrawal agreement.Mrs May and her Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay were greeted by European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier as they arrived at the European Parliament. An extra Cabinet meeting took place in Dublin on Monday evening in light of the developments on the continent and Ministers were due to resume their discussions later. The meeting was told that there are three elements to the emerging Brexit deal. There will be the withdrawal agreement itself, a joint legal interpretation of its meaning and a potential unilateral declaration on the backstop by the UK. Mr Varadkar had adjourned the Cabinet meeting to take a phone call from Mr Juncker before Ministers resumed their discussions. The Cabinet meeting was then adjourned a second time pending the outcome of the meeting between Mrs May and Mr Juncker. Ministers, however, insisted there has been no change in the position that the UK can unilaterally exit the backstop. Legally-bindingMr Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, told MPs that Mrs May and Mr Barclay have secured “legally-binding changes” to the Northern Irish backstop. “Tonight we will be laying two new documents in the House a joint legally-biding instrument on the withdrawal agreement and protocol on Northern Ireland and a joint statement to supplement the political declaration,” he said. “The first provides confirmation that the EU cannot try to trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely and that doing so would be an explicit breach of the legally-binding commitments that both sides have agreed.”He added that the “joint instrument” reflects the commitment to “replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by December 2020”.With less than three weeks to Brexit day on March 29th — when Britain is due to leave the EU — any delay would raise renewed questions as to whether there was any way Mrs May could get her deal through the Commons. It was resoundingly rejected by a 230-vote majority by MPs in January.No-dealThe prime minister has said that if she loses the vote on Tuesday, there will be further votes on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave with no-deal and on Thursday on whether they should seek an extension to the article 50 withdrawal process.Many at Westminster believe that in that event MPs would vote to delay Britain’s departure — to the fury of Brexiteers.The UK government must table its motion for Tuesday’s debate by the end of the day and also publish any relevant documents. MPs have also been promised that they will be shown any updated legal advice from attorney general Geoffrey Cox before the debate begins.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliment’s Brexit coordinator, confirmed he and parliament president Antonio Tajani would also meet Mrs May on Monday night. He tweeted that he hoped “progress can be made” as a no-deal exit for the UK “would be a catastrophe”. “We will stand by Ireland \u0026amp the need to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement,” he said. Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had earlier said Mrs May was planning to travel to Strasbourg to try to finalise an agreement but sources in London said he was “getting ahead of himself”.Senior Government figures who were due to travel on the Taoiseach’s annual visit to Washington DC for St Patrick’s Day were in Dublin Airport earlier on Monday but have since returned to Government Buildings amid the latest developments. Mr Varadkar was also expected to travel today but has remained in Dublin. MeaningfulBritish Brexit minister Robin Walker confirmed on Monday that a second meaningful vote on the prime minister’s EU withdrawal agreement would still take place in the House of Commons on Tuesday.The agreement was rejected by MPs in an earlier vote amid concerns over the Northern Ireland backstop, the insurance policy in the deal that guarantees an open Border in Ireland in all circumstances. Mrs May has been battling to save her Brexit strategy ever since, but the EU has refused to move on thebackstop. Tory Brexiteers had warned that rejection of the withdrawal agreement was “inevitable” in Tuesday’s vote unless Mrs May was able to secure significant changes to the backstop. “Technical” talks between officials took place in Brussels over the weekend and Mrs May spoke to Mr Juncker on Sunday night. The paid had a further phone call on Monday before it was announced that Mrs May would be travelling to Strasbourg. A plane was reported to be on standby at RAF Northolt at the weekend to fly Mrs May to Brussels to clinch an agreement if there was any sign of a deal after talks between her officials and EU negotiators. - Additional reporting: PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open. And they have a responsibility to protect people’s rights and freedoms online.”Mr Berners-Lee’s intervention comes as the UK government is due unveil a white paper setting out its plans to regulate tech giants and online harms.The  understands ministers are planning to impose a legal duty of care on tech companies to protect children, which will be enforced by a new regulator.In his speech, Mr Berners-Lee will identify what he see as the most malicious uses of the web, including state-sponsored hacking, viral spread of misinformation, online harassment and the “polarised tone of online discourse”.He adds: “Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety.”An Oxford graduate from London, Mr Berners-Lee was a 33-year-old software engineer at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva when he penned a paper called “Information Management: A Proposal”. In it he set out the ideas that would create the modern internet.Mr Berners-Lee proposed developing software to allow all computers to share and find information on a mass scale after becoming frustrated at needing to access different computers to read different documents.The epoch-defining paper initially received a cool reception at CERN, with Mr Berners-Lee’s manager marking it as “vague but exciting”.A Brief History of the World Wide Web (1960s-1994)Although CERN did not take up the proposal, Mr Berners-Lee was given the time to develop his ideas.By the early 1990s Mr Berners-Lee had created the first website and then released the technology into the public sphere. The computer scientist has never profited from his creation, deciding that the invention would only truly benefit the world if people could use it royalty-free.However, his era-defining work was feted by Danny Boyle in the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, in which Mr Berners-Lee made a starring cameo.In recent years Mr Berners-Lee has voiced growing concern at the ways in which the web has become increasingly abused.Last year he launched a  “Contract for the Web” that laid out a set of principles to keep the internet free and open.Despite his warnings, Mr Berners-Lee will also strike an optimistic note in today’s speech, arguing that the next three decades should be used to eradicate the harms that have arisen since the web’s inception.He adds: “If we give up on building a better web now, then the web will not have failed us. We will have failed the web.”Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May secures \u0026#39legally binding\u0026#39 assurances on backstop after talks with Jean-Claude JunckerCheat, episode 1, review: Tacky sex scenes spoiled this compelling thrillerThis Time With Alan Partridge, episode 3 review: Alan is back on the BBC full-time – but this episode did tend to overplay the jokes Only 59 motorists have been fined for idling despite councils having the powers for 17 years, FOI revealsMajority of voters do not think PM\u0026#39s deal delivers the type of Brexit people voted for, YouGov poll revealsStop high street Armageddon by cutting business rates, retailing boss urges GovernmentComment: Brexit is there on the table.

Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office.

Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meat that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office.

Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meat that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.The film won four Academy Awards, including the Oscar for Best Actor for Rami Malek, who plays Freddie Mercury.Bohemian Rhapsody\u0026nbspalso attracted criticism for the way it depicts Mercury’s life, especially aspects pertaining to his sexuality and HIV diagnosis.The movie was originally directed by Bryan Singer before he was removed from the project and replaced with Dexter Fletcher.Singer was hit by sexual abuse allegations during awards season, which caused GLAAD to remove\u0026nbspBohemian Rhapsody‘s nomination for Outstanding Film – Wide Release at the GLAAD Media Awards.

Not long after he became children’s minister in January 2018, Mr\u0026nbspZahawi announced the appointment of a private company called Spectra First to\u0026nbspget more than 50 businesses to provide work-based opportunities to young people leaving the care system, including every government department.The competition to say the stupidest thing about Brexit has been wonDiary: Slick work brings in the cash for Tory MP Nadhim ZahawiNeigh way! MP Nadhim Zahawi apologises for stables expense claims“My diary secretary here is brilliant, I would hire her in a heartbeat,” Mr Zahawi says of one of his own hires. He has, since this interview took place, made her a permanent member of staff.\u0026nbsp“All they need is an opportunity in life. You just have to think about these kids in the round. You have to think about their life and their experiences slightly different to, dare I say it, our kids.”Mr Zahawi could not have had a more different start. He arrived in the UK at the age of nine,\u0026nbspthe child of Kurdish parents fleeing the war in Iraq. His first school was Holland Park, a comprehensive in west London. He later moved to Ibstock Place, a private school, and King’s College School, at the time an\u0026nbspindependent school for boys in Wimbledon.\u0026nbspHe won a place at University College London to study chemical engineering, but quickly showed an interest in businesses and started a property company after graduating. In business, he is best known for YouGov, the polling company he co-founded in a garden shed in 2000. He remained its chief executive until 2010, when he was elected to parliament.He gave up several additional business interests when he was\u0026nbspmade education minister in a cabinet reshuffle\u0026nbspin January 2018, including a £350,000-a-year, part-time job at Gulf Keystone, an oil company, and a 50 per cent stake in Zahawi and Zahawi, a firm he founded with his wife Lana in 2010.\u0026nbspBut Mr Zahawi\u0026nbspstill remembers how difficult it was to arrive in the country as a young boy, with no way to communicate.\u0026nbsp“You’re wrenched away from your friends and you come to a new country, you have to start all over again,” he says. “I sat at the back of the class, I didn’t want to get laughed at, trying to string the words together to make a sentence.”Language, he quickly understood, would be the key to moving ahead. “I worked out very quickly that if you communicate well, doors open for you,” he says.\u0026nbspI ask him whether he feels young people from Syria and Afghanistan trying to get to this country in search of a better life should be given the same opportunity. He explains that his family went through the weren’t asylum seekers, but\u0026nbspapplied for settled status through the immigration system to\u0026nbspset up a business in the UK. He believed that people who work hard should be allowed to come to the UK.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got a rigorous immigration system to do that,” he says. “We’ll be able to decide our own immigration policy post-Brexit. For genuine asylum seekers we should be welcoming.”Mr\u0026nbspZahawi backed leaving the European Union. “Brexit appeals to me for no other reason than I thought we could reform within the EU, but when that became undeliverable for David Cameron I reluctantly backed Brexit because I thought the direction of travel for the EU is not right for us.”He says he doesn’t believe the German people have bought into the so-called transfer union, in which wealth within the EU ends up supporting weaker southern economies. He also believes Britons\u0026nbspwould never back the idea of a European army, an idea loathed by Brexiteers, but also seen as highly unlikely: “We’re better off exiting and wishing them luck in their endeavours but securing a trade deal so that we have access to the single market.”He never set out to be a politician. But a chance encounter at university piqued his interest.\u0026nbsp“At the University College of London union, on the first week at university, there was a bloke handing out the Socialist Worker\u0026nbspoutside. It was thin and small and I politely declined his offer at which point he was so aggressive, I thought I would go and find out about what the other side thinks,” he remembers.He was elected Conservative councillor in Putney in 1994, where he remained until 2006. In the interim, he helped run Jeffrey Archer’s unsuccessful campaign for Mayor of London in 1998. He was selected by the local Conservative association for the safe Tory seat of Stratford-on-Avon in 2010 and was re-elected in 2015\u0026nbspand 2017.\u0026nbspAs a member of parliament, Mr Zahawi has voted for reducing the rate of corporation tax and against an amendment in parliament on homes under a certain rent limit being “fit for human habitation”, notable because he is reported to have spent £25m\u0026nbspbuying property around London for buy-to-let and commercial use.\u0026nbspHis success in property has come later in life. After university, Mr Zahawi started an estate agency, but the business suffered when the property market entered a downturn in the Eighties. Mr Zahawi and his business partners were forced to liquidate.“The lesson there was that you don’t know how hard it is to make money unless you lose money,” he says. “It’s well worth all of us remembering in politics that every morning, millions of people get up and start a business or work in a small business and we have to make sure we deliver for them. It really does matter\u0026nbspthat what we do here does not hurt them and their prospects.”Small businesses are expected to be hit hardest by the UK’s decision to leave the EU. Surveys show many businesses have already been affected. Business investment fell for four consecutive quarters in 2018 for the first time since the financial crisis, according to the ONS.\u0026nbspEighty per cent of businesses considered Brexit uncertainty to have already had a negative impact on their investment decisions, according to a survey conducted in October 2018 by the Confederation of British Industry. Falling numbers of migrants have created a squeeze among employers, with the manufacturing industry in particular facing the biggest worker shortage in 30 years, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.Are we heading for a softer Brexit next week?What exactly will be better for small businesses after Brexit? Mr Zahawi doesn’t pause for breath: “One, we’ll be able to trade with the rest of the world. Two, we should be able to trade healthily with Europe and continue to have that trade. And three we’ll have our own policies on immigration or any other issues delivered in the UK.”Despite the challenges of his work, Mr Zahawi says he pinches himself every morning to think that he has ended up where he has. “Look at me today, a boy born in Baghdad, now a member of parliament for Shakespeare and a minister in Her Majesty’s government,” he says. “This country is an amazing country, it really is.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Most were friendly\u0026nbspand willing to have a chat, and several shared stories. One, though, stood out resolutely as always not wanting to know.\u0026nbspWhile I knew left-wing MPs and was able to share a cup of tea or a beer with them, Jeremy Corbyn remained aloof. Attempts to engage with him came to nought.\u0026nbspIt wasn’t personal. I checked with colleagues and journalists at other papers, and he would not talk to them either. His preferred contact was with the Morning Star. The rest of us, it seems, were puppets of the capitalist money-making machine.\u0026nbspReading Tom Bower’s insightful new biography,\u0026nbspDangerous Hero:\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Ruthless Plot for Power, I was reminded of his isolation and single-mindedness. What struck me back then was Corbyn’s determination. He never flinched, did not once drop his guard, would not throw his hands in the air and say, “pull up a chair”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.The most ridiculous claims made about Jeremy Corbyn Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 He called Hezbollah and Hamas ‘friends’True.

The group lists its purpose as the following: “To increase awareness of issues surrounding the dairy industry and focus on economic issues affecting the dairy industry and producers.”It’s a memory that has stayed. Talk to business people and they cite their fear of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. Corbyn, they dismiss as lacking the intellect and robustness of his lieutenant. But that’s the point, as Bower makes clear –\u0026nbspCorbyn is the leader, the orchestrator, the politician who has travelled a long, singular road to the top. He may not have the academic qualifications, he may seem to lack gravitas and at times appear woolly. He is undoubtedly surrounded by people sharper and brighter than he is, like McDonnell. None of it matters. They answer to him.\u0026nbspThere is a fascinating section in Bower’s book that focuses on Corbyn’s economic beliefs. What makes it especially interesting is because it’s rare for Corbyn to expound on domestic policy –\u0026nbsphe’s much more at home discussing a conflict between socialist rebels and an incumbent administration in some far-flung territory.\u0026nbspCorbyn believes that the UK wealthy do not pay enough tax. Writes Bower, he would like a return to the James Callaghan era, when the country’s richest paid a top rate of 98 per cent tax on income. Bower tries to counter that with the correct assertion that the top 1 per cent of British taxpayers already contribute 27 per cent of the nation’s income tax take, and the top 10 per cent pay 59 per cent a higher proportion than the richest 10 per cent of Germany’s population pay.\u0026nbspSuch comparisons almost certainly count for little with Corbyn –\u0026nbspthe man who would rather sit on his own reading the Morning Star is not going to be easily persuaded, not least with a glance in the direction of what he must regard as the loathsomely financially corrupt and socially unjust Germany.\u0026nbspLikewise, when Corbyn proposed “people’s quantitative easing”, the printing by the Bank of England of new money sufficient to meet the government’s requirements he brushed aside the possibility that this would lead to hyperinflation, and repetition of what occurred in Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe after 2010, and more recently, Venezuela. He simply did not want to listen.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn should realise Labour’s heartlands want a Final SaySimilarly, he would like to recreate a new national investment bank pumping hundreds of millions of pounds into Britain’s motor industry. The route to prosperity “is a collective process between workers, public investment and services, and yes, often innovative and creative iniduals”. You can feel the hesitancy and reluctance accompanying the citation of that last grouping.\u0026nbspIt is true that in the 1970s, Britain did make cars. But the sector now is a shadow of its former self. Worse, Nissan will not be using Sunderland to manufacture its new X-Trail SUV, and Honda in Swindon has signalled its intention to shut completely.\u0026nbspIt’s as if Corbyn has failed to register the onset of globalisation, the closure of factories across the land caused by cheaper labour and greater productivity elsewhere, and the fact that a large measure of what success Britain has achieved economically in the last few decades is down to the growth of the City of London and financial services.\u0026nbspIn his eyes, the City was to blame for the crisis of 2008 and its aftermath. That may be so but he chooses to discount the explosion in jobs in finance and the success it enjoyed before and since. Indeed, without the City, the UK would be in far worse shape.\u0026nbspBut the rose-tinted spectacles of this class warrior only see romance in metal-bashing and the honest sweat and toil of the shop floor. Quite how he intends to deal with the advent of the likes of artificial intelligence, robots and 3D printing is not clear.Reading Bower, you’re left in no doubt that Corbyn wants to turn the clock back, that his solution to those problematic examples and awkward developments that upset his path is merely to ignore them. This makes him very dangerous indeed, hard to reason with, oblivious to criticism and\u0026nbspset in his ways. It’s a troubling account, one that should give every entrepreneur pause and anyone who works in business pause. I want to scream and tell Corbyn to follow current events in Venezuela, and examine the chaos and strife that have befallen that country. I would, I fear, be wasting my time.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, and communications advisory firmWe’ll tell you what’s true.

They will thus be\u0026nbspdenied\u0026nbspa say on the appointment of company directors, including the CEO and chair, on deals the company might enter into, on the annual report, boardroom pay, on anything of consequence in fact.\u0026nbspThey will no longer be able to speak at or even attend the company’s AGM for as long as the shares are treated as restricted. Britons will also be blocked from buying any new\u0026nbspshares in Ryanair.\u0026nbspAt this point you might very well be asking how on earth can the company can do this.Well, Ryanair’s an airline, and under the rather arcane rules that exist around the world concerning airline ownership, it needs to be majority owned and controlled by EU investors to be able to fly around the bloc, which is where its majority of the business comes from.\u0026nbspTo ensure this remains the case in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the company has taken the step courtesy of the powers granted to its board by its articles of association.\u0026nbspIt is possible someone may attempt to challenge the move. But if the no-deal cliff edge crumbles they, and everyone else, will likely have bigger issues to deal with. So I wouldn’t get your hopes up.\u0026nbspThere is an interesting wrinkle to this. According to Ryanair’s most recent annual report, EU citizens held 52.8 per cent of the company. UK institutions and iniduals make up a significant proportion of that.\u0026nbspMuch of the non-EU part is owned by Americans via American Depository Receipts (ADRs) which are a specific type of paper that non-US companies sell to US investors and that are tradable on US exchanges.\u0026nbspSo in theory, EU shareholders could be in the minority even if its UK shareholders are stripped of their rights. It will be interesting to see how the company works its way around that one.\u0026nbspBut this being Ryanair, you would presume the company had considered the issue and worked out a plan.\u0026nbspRyanair is popular in with US investors because it is very low cost, and not overly fond of unions. Its directors won’t want to upset what has been a largely supportive part of its investor base.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

If the UK is given “Part 2 listed status”, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. “These would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,” says Eurotunnel. The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue – subject to any local disruption at Folkestone andor CalaisMotorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types.Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union.The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights – so do their families and friendsCurrent European passengers’ rights rules, known as EC2612004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to “extraordinary circumstances”. Buried in a document called Beyond the Horizon: The Future of UK Aviation, the government says “the UK will not fall below current standards of protection when we leave the EU”814 Entry regulations to the European UnionFrom 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, UK travellers will become “third-country nationals” when travelling to Schengen countries and subject to the standard rules of admission for citizens of nations such as the US, Japan and Australia. That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure.914 Online registration prior to travel – ETIASFrom 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area – including British travellers – will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries.A large number of travel providers – even including National Express coaches – have added “Brexit clauses” to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for “consequential losses” as a result of Brexit-related issues1114 ‘Fast track’ lanes for passport control entering EU countriesBritish passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals.The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: “Unlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara.

If you’re a creator of comic books featuring the adventures of super-powered, costumed heroes, that might be a difficult rule of thumb to apply. But perhaps not for Tom King. In Mister Miracle, from DC Comics, King and artist Mitch Gerads have created one of the most critically acclaimed graphic novels of the last year, and for the Washington-based writer, he drew on experiences that not a lot of other creators working in the field today have access to.King, 40, who was born in California, spent several years as a counter-terrorism officer for the CIA, working out in the field in Iraq and Afghanistan. It’s fascinating to think about what King saw and did, and how that later informed his writing. Obviously, I suggest, if he tells me too much about it he’ll have to kill me.\u0026nbspHe’s heard that one before, of course, probably more times than he can count. “No,” he says, with what feels like an oft-trodden out reply, “if I tell you too much about it, they’ll have to kill me.”Born to a film-writer mother in Southern California, King developed a love of storytelling and an understanding of narrative from an early age. During the 1990s he interned at the offices of the two big comics publishers, Marvel and DC. His ambition, though, was to become a lawyer\u0026nbspand he graduated from Columbia University in the year 2000, intending to follow this path. He started working for the Justice Department.And then came 11 September. Like everyone else in America, King was appalled and shocked and numbed. But he also knew he wanted to do something in response. So he went on to the CIA website and discovered that they were recruiting.“They were looking to bring in a new generation of operatives to serve in this new world,” he says. “They wanted people who were good at connecting the dots. I went in maybe hoping to get a job as an information guy, I took the psych tests, and ended up as an operations officer.”Created with Sketch.Mister Miracle: The critically acclaimed graphic novel in pictures Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photos by DC ComicsPhotos by DC ComicsKing worked out in the field in Afghanistan and Iraq for seven years, and the exact nature of his work out there is necessarily vague. When his wife fell pregnant with their first son (they have three children now) he knew he had a difficult decision to make.“The part of the job I loved was being overseas, out in the war zone, as bizarre as that might sound,” he says. “But I knew I didn’t want to do that and have a family. I didn’t want to be away from my wife and kid for a year at a time.”Returning to the US, King didn’t resume his plan to become a lawyer but instead turned to his first love, writing. But he wasn’t back in the world of comic books just yet… or at least, not quite. King wrote a prose novel, but about superheroes. A Once-Crowded Sky was published in 2012, to good notices. Writing about superheroes had regalvanised his love of comics\u0026nbspand opened the door for him to work at DC.His first gig was a series about Dick Grayson, the original Batman side-kick Robin who grew up and adopted a new persona, Nightwing. Co-written with Tim Seeley with art by Mikel Jannen, the series was the first time that King was able to draw on his CIA past, as the character quit the superhero business to become a spy.That led to more work, and to the series that first brought King to wider notice – and his first collaboration with Mitch Gerads, his Mister Miracle co-creator. Published in late 2015, The Sheriff of Babylon was a critically-acclaimed crime series about a San Diego cop who becomes a military consultant in Iraq\u0026nbspand has to solve the murder of a young local police trainee.More work followed, with King getting to write characters both classic and obscure, from Batman to the Omega Men for DC, and the Vision (the character played by Paul Bettany in The Avengers movies) for Marvel.Which led to King and Gerads working together again on what has become one of the most well-received comic books in recent years, earning plaudits from mainstream reviewers and publications especially… Mister Miracle.Mister Miracle is a character who was first introduced in 1971, created by the towering genius that was Jack Kirby for DC comics. Real name Scott Free (ouch. But it was the 1970s, and King and Gerads do a fine job of contextualising that), Mister Miracle is billed as a “super escape artist”, Houdini in a cape and mask and yellow, green and red livery. He’s always been one of those B-List characters, except to the most devoted fans, in terms of recognisability.But in an age where, thanks to the big comics companies mining their intellectual properties and breathing fresh life and mainstream appeal into characters formerly known only to the cognoscenti – s of the Galaxy, anyone? Ant-Man? Black Panther? Aquaman? Suicide Squad? – even the non-rabid comics fan seems more willing to accept stories featuring characters who aren’t Superman, Batman, Captain America or Spider-Man.DC cancels comic where Jesus learns from superhero after backlash Still, a super escape artist in a garish costume. Possibly limited scope there for anything beyond a series of set-piece daring feats, you might think. Which is possibly why Mister Miracle won so much praise by being one of the most literary and absorbing stories released by DC in some years.It opens with a shocking image… the titular character slumped on his bathroom floor, wrists cut and bleeding out over the tiles. Yes, it begins with a superhero attempting to commit suicide.“Scott Free can escape from anything,” says King. “So we thought… he’s going to keep pushing it, trying to escape from more and more difficult situations. And eventually he thinks, can I escape from death?”King and Gerads had wanted to work on another big series after the Sheriff of Babylon, and initially they pitched an idea for a Batman comic but focussing on two big villains, the Joker and the Riddler. However, the characters were already earmarked for a storyline in the main Batman comic, so it was vetoed. DC, however, threw them another option.Gerads says, “I got a call from Tom and he told me that we couldn’t do the Batman story. He said what would your second choice be, and straight away I said Mister Miracle.” Gerads pauses. “That’s absolutely true. And Tom said, well, that’s what they’ve offered us. And he sent me the pitch and the first line was, ‘Mister Miracle attempts suicide’.”Starting from that dark place, the story then expands out into an exploration of, really, the anxieties of living in the modern era. Scott Free is married to the unlikely-named Big Barda, and they are attempting to navigate the mores of family life in present-day Los Angeles. But Scott and Barda are also not of this Earth.Original Mister Miracle creator Jack Kirby dreamed up for DC comics in the 1970s a series of books that became known as the Fourth World, existing within the normal DC continuity of Batman and Wonder Woman, but also slightly apart from it. It focussed on two worlds, New Genesis, where the benevolent New Gods lived, and Apokolips, brutal realm of the tyrannical Darkseid. New Genesis and Apokolips are perpetually at war, and in a bid to broker peace, their rulers Darkseid and the Highfather agree to swap infant sons. Scott Free is the child of New Genesis, brought up in the hellish Apokolips, where he learns his craft and meets Barda, one of the fearsome Female Furies. Together they escape, and make a new life on Earth, but are called back into the war, which is where we find them in this story.Mister Miracle was originally released as a 12-issue monthly series, and has just now been collected into a single volume. But it was always meant to be read as a graphic novel. King says, “It’s like a Dickens novel, which were originally serialised. It’s meant to be read as one story.” He pauses. “Not that I’m comparing myself to Dickens, obviously.”The story is a mix of domestic life and the horrors of war. In one memorable scene, Scott and Barda fight their way over several pages through the terrors of Apokolips, holding a conversation as they do about redecorating their condo flat, building up to the tender moment – delivered as each character despatches bad guys in a sequence that looks like a platform video game – that Barda reveals she is pregnant.Mister Miracle is a very personal book for both King and Gerads. The sheer exhausting nature of war comes across in several scenes, obviously drawn from King’s experiences. And Gerads’ son was born right in the middle of him working on the series, adding extra dimension to the point where Barda gives birth.Gerads has also done artwork for Batman (DC Comics)It should be noted that comics are a very collaborative medium, and King and Gerads worked closely on the distinctive look of the story. The trend in comics these days is for big, break-out images, kaleidoscopic panels, imaginative layouts. With Mister Miracle, the team went for a nine-panel grid, most closely associated with the classic of the genre from 30 years ago, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ Watchmen.That’s perhaps informed the mainstream success of Mister Miracle. It might be an odd thing to say, but reading comics is a learned skill, and not everybody gets on with the medium. A strict page design allows for easier digesting of the narrative. Gerads says, “Some people in comics think doing a grid like this must be very constricting for the artist, but that’s not the case. The magic with this is that you know exactly how the reader is going to read your page.”King likens it to “almost like three Charlie Brown cartoons on each page, three panels each, and everybody knows how to read those”.Aside from being a meditation on war and a domestic drama with dialogue that would satisfy any Netflix drama binge-watcher, there’s also a bigger storyline at play in Mister Miracle. To wit, is any of it actually happening? Is it all, in fact, the dream of a superhero who’s lying on his bathroom floor, his life slowly ebbing away?“Living life is full of ambiguities,” says King, perhaps a little ambiguously himself.Gerads is more forthcoming, and points out that Scott Free is in every single scene in the story. “We never leave Scott’s side in the entire book, we go on this ride with Scott through the story. Perhaps by the end Scott realises that it doesn’t matter if it’s real or not, because one way or another this is what he’s lived through.”It was announced last year that one of DC’s next big movie projects will be based on the New Gods world, with Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle In Time) lined up to direct. Rumours emerged in the last few weeks that Scott Free and Big Barda will actually form the central focus of the movie. Whether it will end up as an adaptation of this story, neither King nor Gerads could say, but if it does it could end up DC’s most interesting movie yet.King and Gerads are hatching another collaboration for DC, which they aren’t at liberty to discuss (though King drops the hint that there’s a clue within Mister Miracle as to what that might be) and in the meantime, King is writing for the publisher Heroes in Crisis, which deals with the post-traumatic stress disorder that could actually affect superheroes given the ongoing violence and battles they deal with on a daily basis.Does he find writing about the things he’s seen and experience during his time with the CIA cathartic? Or is it painful? Perhaps a bit of both, he says.“I think me writing about war has been more necessary than anything else,” he says. “War and the damage that war does has formed the basis for a lot of my work. I write to give my kids a better life and the best thing for me has been to draw on what I’ve done. But I think I might be ready to talk about something else, now.”Mister Miracle by Tom King and Mitch Gerads is out now and\u0026nbsppublished by DC Comics.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

The company continues its shift to towards online-only sales, but now says it won\u0027t close as many stores as originally thought.\u0026nbspThe $35,000 base Model 3 will still be available, but the company is raising prices by 3 per cent on all other models.\u0026nbspIn a Monday filing with government regulators, Tesla now says it closed 10 per cent of its stores, but a few of those will now remain open. Another 20 per cent are being evaluated and some could remain open.\u0026nbspThe company gave no numbers, but said it would close only about half the stores that it had intended to. It has 378 stores and service centres worldwide and about 100 stores in the US.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a result of keeping significantly more stores open, Tesla will need to raise vehicle prices by about 3 percent on average worldwide,” a company\u0027s statement said. “We will only close about half as many stores, but the cost savings are therefore only about half.”\u0026nbspRemaining stores could have fewer workers, but will have vehicles available for test drives and a small inventory in case people want to buy immediately, the statement said.\u0026nbspThe company also announced on Monday that it has purchased car-hauling trucks and trailers from a California company in a stock deal worth about $14.2m. Tesla paid for the purchase with about 50,000 previously authorised shares. Tesla wants to increase its vehicle transportation capacity and cut delivery times.\u0026nbspThe reversal shows that Tesla had second thoughts about shuttering the stores and whether buyers would make such a large purchase without a test drive. The company says it still plans to offer buyers the ability to return purchased vehicles at no cost after a seven-day or 1,000 mile test drive.\u0026nbspGartner analyst Michael Ramsey called the move “startling” and said it undermines the credibility of Mr Musk and Tesla\u0027s management.\u0026nbsp“How else can you view it except to see it as a remarkable example of lack of foresight or planning?” Mr Ramsey asked. “It\u0027s almost as if the decision was announced and made without any analysis of what the outcome would be.”\u0026nbspMr Musk probably realised that he was locked into long-term leases on the stores that he would have to pay regardless of whether they were closed, Mr Ramsey said.\u0026nbspThe move made no sense to begin with because Tesla had spent millions fighting in courts and state legislatures trying to change laws that prevented companies from selling vehicles at their own stores, Ramsey said.\u0026nbspTesla starts taking orders for Model 3 electric carBut he also said the move to close 10 per cent of stores and evaluate others is the right thing to do, and said most retail companies do that all of the time.\u0026nbspMessages were left Monday seeking comment from a Tesla spokesman.\u0026nbspShares of Tesla edged up less than 1 per cent in trading early Monday.\u0026nbspIn announcing the move on 28 February, chief executive Elon Musk said it was necessary to cut costs in order to profitably sell the mass-market version of the Model 3 sedan for $35,000. That\u0027s a price point needed to reach more consumers and generate the sales that the company needs to survive, Mr Musk has said.\u0026nbspBefore the announcement, the cheapest Model 3 started at $42,900.\u0026nbsp“This is the only way to achieve the savings for this car and be financially sustainable,” Mr Musk told reporters during a conference call announcing the change. “It is excruciatingly difficult to make this car for $35,000 and be financially sustainable.”\u0026nbspElon Musk branded \u0027a liar\u0027 by investor as US regulators seeks to oust Tesla bossOn 28 February, the company said shifting totally to online sales would allow it to lower all vehicle prices by 6 per cent, on average, including its higher-end Model S and Model X.\u0026nbspAt the time, Mr Musk also walked back the company\u0027s guidance that it would be profitable in all future quarters, saying it would post a loss in the first quarter of this year.\u0026nbspAll other major car manufacturers rely on vast dealer networks, but Mr Musk co-founded Tesla in 2003 in an effort to shake up the industry, starting with a focus entirely on a fleet of cars powered by electricity instead of petrol.\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Many had hoped we would have clarity at this stage, particularly in advance of the vote tomorrow. We don’t yet.“The British prime minister is travelling to Strasbourg this evening, I understand, to try to finalise an agreement, if that is possible, to be able to put that to a meaningful vote in Westminster tomorrow.”Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, who was party to recent political discussions with Brussels along side attorney general Geoffrey Cox,\u0026nbspwill accompany Ms May to the talks.They and other officials are expected to land in Strasbourg at 8pm\u0026nbspUK time, before going into a meeting with Commission\u0026nbsppresident Mr Juncker. Photographers have been told to be ready for a 10pm\u0026nbsppress conference involving Ms May.She must convince Tory Brexiteer MPs in the backbench European Research Group and her Northern Irish DUP partners in government that any change she secures allows the UK a legally-binding way out of the ‘Irish backstop’ arrangement currently set out in the withdrawal agreement.The backstop comes into play if the EU and UK have failed to agree future trading arrangements by the end of 2020, thus keeping the Irish border open, but also locking the UK into a customs union with the EU on a potentially indefinite basis.A key indicator of how successful her renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement has been, will be if Mr Cox is able to change his legal advice to the government\u0026nbsprelating to the indefinite nature of the backstop.\u0026nbspMembers of the ERG have previously said that the backstop would have to be replaced altogether, something the EU will not agree to, raising questions as to wether any alterations made by negotiators will suffice.Speaking earlier in the day Mark Francois said: “This isn’t just semantics.\u0026nbspThere’s a big difference between replacing something, and just tweaking it.“And what the government have asked them, is to tweak it.\u0026nbspWhat the commons, what the House of Commons, what parliament gave her a mandate to ask for, was to replace it.\u0026nbspThat’s what the House of Commons voted for.”The prime minister’s de-facto deputy David Lidington\u0026nbspis now set to make a commons statement on Brexit this evening, that could update MPs on any breakthrough.Insiders said it could be possible that the statement is pushed back as late as 10pm, in order to allow Mr Lidington to be in the best position possible to inform the house.Ms May will put a deal, one way or another, to a vote of the house on Tuesday and has said if she loses, there will be further votes on Wednesday on whether the UK should leave with no-deal and on Thursday on whether they should seek an extension to the Article 50 withdrawal process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This is, as has been widely stated, wrong, and her tweet has been deleted, but there is another side to the story which is more favourable to McVey.First, though, the actual facts. As things stand the UK and Denmark have an absolute exemption from the obligation to join the euro. This was the famous “opt-out” from the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, which set in train the long process towards adopting the euro across much (though even now not all) of\u0026nbspthe EU. All the other member states of the EU in 1992 have now adopted the single currency some members that joined after 1992 and after the first wave of euro nations abolished their currencies in 1999\u0026nbsphave also adopted the euro – Slovenia in 2007, followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015.Altogether 19 of the 28 member states are members of the euro, including all of the largest economies except the UK. It has made trade and cross-border movements of money much smoother and made international pricing of goods and services more transparent, reducing business costs and adding modestly to economic growth.\u0026nbspHowever, despite this, others countries have not joined the euro, despite this being a formal accession treaty obligation once certain criteria are met. For example, Sweden, which joined in 1995, still retains its krona and shows little inclination\u0026nbspto adopt the euro nor, it seems,\u0026nbspare the European Commission and European Central Bank pushing the point.Should we purchase euros for a trip to Italy in April?By contrast other, weaker economies that might wish to ditch their own currencies in favour of the euro are not yet qualified to do so. The experience of Greece, which was allowed to join the currency probably before its economy was strong enough, has been instructive.\u0026nbspAs well as the UK and Denmark, other EU members still outside include Poland, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.The problems with the single currency are well publicised, and have caused real economic harm and human misery among those countries that have\u0026nbspendured years of austerity to try and make themselves more competitive, andor pay for the banking rescues required after the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThat is why richer countries – which would be expected to bankroll the system – are wary of joining. The Greek example is why some weaker countries are also cautious about the disciplines imposed by the system, and why the richer countries are also disinclined to hurry them into the arrangement.\u0026nbspPresident Macron’s proposal for a “fiscal” union to complement the monetary union – effectively moving some macroeconomic decisions on overall levels of taxes, public spending and borrowing to the European level – have been rejected by Germany, which usually pays the bills (Finland and the Netherlands also chip in). So this inherently unstable system seems set to continue on its present basis.Whether the UK would be allowed its euro opt-out if it rejoined the EU in a few years’ time is impossible to predict,\u0026nbspbut it would not necessarily be granted.Where\u0026nbspMcVey and her cited journalist have a point is that the euro was originally regarded as essential to ensure a “level playing field” under the single market. Countries, in other words, cannot gain an “unfair” advantage by devaluing or “manipulating” their currency as a way out of their uncompetitiveness (usually stemming from poor productivity, high wages and too much debt).That logic applies as much today and in the 2020s as is it did in 1992. There may come a point when the political pressure on non-euro members to join the currency – whatever the legal formalities – would become so intense as to be unbearable. In that sense non-euro members states are always at long-term risk of being pushed towards the euro – but Denmark and the UK do have that strong international treaty protection in the final analysis.Equally, it is true that the euro might fragment long before such pressures on members to join\u0026nbspre-emerge. It seemed perfectly possible that it would collapse a few years ago. Today the precarious Italian public finances and banking system represent a mortal danger to the euro system, as the Italian economy is far bigger than Greece, and “too big to save”.\u0026nbspSo, in the end, Esther McVey and her critics might both be proved equally wrong.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

He also says he understands MPs will want to study these documents and they will have a chance to questions the government during the debate tomorrow.MPs will want the attorney general Geoffrey Cox to consider these carefully, rather than rush it out, he says.The government will also table the motion for the meaningful vote tonight. The vote will take place tomorrow.MPs will face a fundamental choice tomorrow between an \u0027improved deal or to plunge this country into a political crisis\u0027, he says. MPs roar and groan at this - quite reasonably some might argue.David Lidington says he can provide an update on what has been achieved.The PM and the Brexit secretary have achieved legally binding changes which strengthen and improve the deal,\u0026nbsphe says.Tonight, the government will be laying two new documents - a joint legally binding instrument on the Brexit deal and a joint statement to supplement the political declaration,\u0026nbsphe says.The first will confirm the EU cannot trap the UK in the backstop indefinitely. If the EU did this, the UK could bring a formal dispute through independent arbitration.It commits to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements by 2020, setting out explicitly that these new arrangements do not have to replicate the backstop.Second document supplements the political declaration, Lidington says. It sets how negotiations on alternative arrangements will be carried out.Lucy Frazer, the justice minister, is wrapping things up in the Commons. Lots of cabinet ministers are arriving ahead of a statement by David Lidington, the de-facto deputy PM.\u0026nbspShe is trying to speak for as long as possible to give the PM as long as possible to make her statement. Cabinet ministers are on the benches, including Philip Hammond, the chancellor.Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker\u0026nbspsays it is important to remember that MPs voted to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements but\u0026nbspI very much doubt that has been achieved.He told Sky News: Deal fever abounds tonight but the crucial thing is will this backstop come to an end? Could we safely vote for the agreement without having that kind of entrapment?He says the European Research Group (ERG) will take their public duty seriously and plan to have their top lawyers scrutinise the legal text. But they haven\u0027t seen it yet.A spokeswoman for the Irish government said the meeting had been adjourned and would reconvene later tonight.The Taoiseach spoke to President Juncker this evening, she said.The Cabinet met to discuss developments across the day. Cabinet meeting adjourned just after 8.30pm and will resume again later this evening. Discussions are continuing.Here\u0027s a clip of Ms May\u0027s arrival in Strasbourg.\u0026nbspSeveral cabinet ministers left Government Buildings in Dublin at about 8.40pm.None commented as they left.Reminder - while all eyes are on Strasbourg, MPs are still waiting for the government to make a Brexit statement. The prime minister must lay down a motion for tomorrow\u0027s meaningful vote before the Commons rises tonight, meaning they are racing against the clock to get this done.MPs will then be able to table amendments to the government motion, to try to shape the process.Earlier, Speaker John Bercow, insisted the Commons will not be messed around by ministers over a crucial Brexit vote, amid widespread uncertainty over the government\u0027s plans.The Speaker sounded his warning after several MPs condemned the lack of time available for them to consider any changes to the Brexit deal and to table amendments.Brexit minister Robin Walker confirmed a second meaningful vote on Theresa May\u0027s deal will take place on Tuesday, but he was unable to offer further details as to when the motion will be brought forward, noting that negotiations are ongoing.Mr Bercow hinted Tuesday\u0027s debate on the Brexit deal could be delayed by extra business being added to the schedule, which would give MPs a chance to assess new information, while Independent former minister Chris Leslie suggested a suspension of the sitting may be required.The Speaker also confirmed Brexit secretary Steve Barclay\u0027s statement to the Commons on Monday was expected at either 10pm or it might come a little earlier.He added it will take place when the government is in a position to make, dare I say it, a meaningful statement to MPs.The Irish premier, Leo Varadkar, who was due to begin his journey to America\u0026nbspfor St Patrick\u0027s Day, returned from Dublin airport and is currently in government buildings for the cabinet briefing.\u0026nbspEverything is moving very quickly, but if Theresa May manages to get some sort of agreement tonight then there could be several critical votes this week.\u0026nbspRead our explainer on what\u0027s to come:Amid the Brexit drama, the government has released a list of critical goods which could be carried on additional ferries\u0026nbspchartered in the event of a no-deal Brexit.On the list are medicines for humans and animals, vaccines, infant milk formula, organs for transplants and chemicals for the energy industry.It comes after transport\u0026nbspsecretary Chris Grayling\u0026nbspissued contracts totalling £107m in December for ferry firms to run additional services to take the pressure off the Dover-Calais route if the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29.The contract with Seaborne Freight to provide a service between Ramsgate and Ostend was dropped after attracting controversy because the company had no ships.But Brittany Ferries and DFDS are set to run ferries into and out of Poole, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Immingham and Felixstowe in the case of no-deal.Items on the list include:- Human medicines, covering prescription-only, pharmacy and general sales list medicines, clinical trials and children\u0027s vitamins- Medical devices and clinical consumables- Vaccines- Nutritional specialist feeds, including infant milk formula- Biological materials such as blood, organs, tissues and cells- All veterinary medicines authorised under the Veterinary Medicines Regulation and unauthorised veterinary medicines covered by a Special Import Scheme- Critical chemicals or consumables used within the energy sector.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to load\u0026nbspSome senior Conservatives said Ms May should postpone the vote rather than risk another damaging defeat.Instead she was being urged to table a conditional motion setting out the terms for dealing with the backstop issue which parliament would be prepared to accept.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But it’s still possible\u0026nbspthat the\u0026nbspdate could shift,\u0026nbspwith MPs gearing up for yet another monumental week in British politics.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister said herself in a last minute plea for support for her deal on Friday: “Reject it and no one knows what will happen.“We may not leave the EU for many months, we may leave without the protections that the deal provides. We may never leave at all.”On Tuesday, Ms May will give MPs a second chance to vote on her Brexit deal, two months after it was rejected by 230 votes –\u0026nbspthe heaviest parliamentary defeat for\u0026nbspany British prime minister in the modern era.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

So far, she has failed on both counts, with the EU 27 united in resistance to such efforts.\u0026nbspUnless the prime minister secures last-minute concessions this weekend, in an eleventh-hour dash to Brussels, many in Westminster expect the second “meaningful vote” to be resoundingly defeated too.\u0026nbspBritain does not want a long delay to Brexit saga, poll showsHowever, if parliament springs a surprise and her deal passes on Tuesday, Brexit will be secured – although\u0026nbspMs May would probably have to request a short extension to the Article 50 timeframe so that\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspcan\u0026nbspdebate and vote on key pieces of legislation that are required to be in place for exit day.\u0026nbspAssuming the prime minister does not win the day, the scale of defeat will be key.If it is similar\u0026nbspto January, it could be fatal for Ms May, who will undoubtedly face claims\u0026nbspthat she has wasted precious time in the last two months. Her deal will be considered dead.In this case, the prime minister would probably be out of options, and will be under considerable pressure to go down a softer Brexit route. This would risk\u0026nbspa potential\u0026nbspsplit in\u0026nbspher party while she seeks a majority for an alternative deal and effectively forms a parliamentary alliance\u0026nbspwith Jeremy Corbyn.Created with Sketch.

This would almost certainly require a short delay to the Brexit process.Mr Corbyn may also decide the time is opportune –\u0026nbspif Ms May loses badly –\u0026nbspto put down a second no-confidence motion in the government in an effort to force a general election, though\u0026nbspit still does not appear the Labour leader has the numbers in the Commons to win such a vote. \u0026nbspHe has also committed his party to backing an\u0026nbspamendment\u0026nbspon a second referendum, so this could also be the week in which MPs finally test whether there\u0026nbspis a majority for such a path. The consensus is that there is not, and it may be that proponents of a further public vote on Brexit do not test the Commons just yet.Votes on no-deal and Article 50 extensionCrucially, if the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote” on her deal, she has vowed to hold two further votes this week: one on a no-deal Brexit (due to take place on Wednesday), and a second an approving an extension to Article 50 and delaying Britain’s exit from the EU (Thursday). This is where there might be fireworks.EU accused of ‘playing games’ in last-ditch Brexit negotiationsBanks ‘broke agreement to suspend Brexit campaigning’ after Cox murderCorbyn tells May second defeat for her deal is ‘the end of the road’EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayPound falls after May warns of ‘moment of crisis’ over BrexitIt has been clear for some\u0026nbsptime that there is no majority in the House of Commons for a disorderly (or “cliff-edge”)\u0026nbspbreak from the bloc. As such, it is likely that MPs will vote to take a no-deal departure off the table.The following day there will be a vote on extending Article 50, and it is anticipated\u0026nbspthere will be a majority for this course of action.Ultimately, it is up to the EU 27 whether to grant any extension: if they agree,\u0026nbspterms and conditions might easily be attached. They could, for example, demand a lengthy extension rather than the\u0026nbsptwo-month period preferred at Westminster.Ms May will have to decide whether or not to give her own MPs\u0026nbspa free vote on the contentious issue of the no-deal scenario. It is an incredibly isive topic among Conservatives, and throughout the negotiations,\u0026nbspthe prime minister has deployed the threat of a no-deal outcome. \u0026nbspIf the prime minister decides not\u0026nbspto give Tory\u0026nbspMPs a free\u0026nbspvote, and whips them\u0026nbspto keep no deal on the table, it could easily lead to a significant number of ministerial resignations from the Remain-leaning figures at the top of government who would probably rebel.\u0026nbspAs the prime minister herself said, reject the deal and “no-one knows what will happen”\u0026nbspbut what we do know is that\u0026nbspMs May is about to enter one of the most dangerous weeks of her time in office.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

We are not a party within a party.”We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

The PM’s half-hearted proposals don’t come anywhere near that protection.”His concern was echoed by TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes, who warned that the prime minister was “playing fast and loose on the issue of workers’ rights”.He said: “Our rights are not poker chips to be played with in the Conservative Brexit casino.“Our rights are hard-won and it’s the duty of every Labour MP not to collude with the Tories to get rid of them.“This clear expert legal opinion only goes to show that May’s offer was never a serious prospect on workers’ rights.”Labour MP Jo Stevens, who supports the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid the PM’s promises were “meaningless and not worth the paper they are written on” and urged her Labour colleagues not to be taken in.We’ll tell you what’s true.

No one knew it just yet\u0026nbspbut they heralded a dramatic escalation of tensions in which two nuclear-armed nations would launch airstrikes against each other for the first time in history. \u0026nbsp“Everyone woke up, everyone was frightened and ran outside the house,” Mr Yusuf, who lives with his wife and three children, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“They looked towards the sky to see what was happening. It was night, we couldn’t see anything but we heard the jets. They were very loud.“I had never heard that sound, but I knew what it must be. We thought something must be happening at the borders…\u0026nbspWe thought a war was starting.”Created with Sketch.Grenade attack injures at least 18 in Kashmir: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Glass shattered in the explosion litters the floor around the bus in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA sniffer dog and policemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen and onlookers stand at the site of a grenade blast in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade attack are treated at the government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA person injured in a grenade attack is carried for treatment to a government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade blast are taken to the hospital for treatment in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaGlass shattered in the explosion litters the floor around the bus in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA sniffer dog and policemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen and onlookers stand at the site of a grenade blast in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade attack are treated at the government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the site of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaA person injured in a grenade attack is carried for treatment to a government medical hospital in Jammu, IndiaPeople injured in a grenade blast are taken to the hospital for treatment in Jammu, IndiaPolicemen inspect the bus that was subject of a grenade attack in Jammu, IndiaMr Yusuf is not the only resident of Srinagar who describes lying to his children that day. Though he knew it wasn’t true, he told his youngest son, 10-year-old Azar, that “everything was OK, it was a regular movement of jets”.This is the reality of life in Srinagar, caught in the middle of a row between India, Pakistan and Kashmiri leaders over the future of the region.For although both India and Pakistan administer part of Kashmir, they both claim it in its entirety.The tensions at the border mean that, even in the best of recent times, Kashmir has been described as the most highly militarised place on Earth, with an estimated 650,000 armed Indian security personnel stationed in a small valley surrounded on all sides by mountains.Srinagar, KashmirWere it not teeming with armed police, Srinagar would be an inviting tourist destination. It boasts excellent skiing, trekking, stunning views over the great Dal Lake and exceptional heritage architecture.Yet even the Pari Mahal, a 400-year-old terraced Mughal garden overlooking the valley, has its ancient stone pavilions stuffed with sandbags. The Indian paramilitary police force has moved in with a small camp here, too.For residents, tensions have spiked dramatically since the 14 February car bomb attack by a separatist militant on an army convoy, and the aerial engagement that followed between India and Pakistan.Abdul Karim Kaloo, a boatman in his seventies offering rides across the Jhelum river, says the last time he saw fighter jets flying over Srinagar was in the 1965 India-Pakistan war.“This reminds me of that time,” he says.With traders’ associations calling regular strikes and the city on edge, Mr Kaloo says his business is suffering. “It’s really down, and there is also a lot of fear among the people of Kashmir because of this conflict.”He has two grandchildren, and worries for their safety most of all. “People don’t know if they leave their home in the morning, whether they’ll come back in the evening,” he says.There are no shoppers along the downtown street where tourist groups would normally be taken to see handicrafts and Kashmiri textiles, much sought after in the rest of India.One elderly shopkeeper is too nervous to talk in the current climate.Another, 25-year-old Aabid Kapra, speaks passionately about how, between the strikes and tensions with the security forces, the current crisis is killing his business.“Day by day we are becoming more stressed. Financially we are losing, our education is disappearing, our businesses are being lost, and it is taking its toll on our minds.”The armed police have been enforcing greater restrictions on movement and crackdowns on separatist political groups since the Pulwama attack, and Mr Kapra spoke angrily about being blocked from walking to his own shop.“Whenever I go outside and see the armed troops standing there, I feel harassed,” he says. “In the rest of India, the army are there to help you. Here, because they are a show of force, you can’t even ask them for an address. And if you see them doing something wrong, they are not accountable for anything.”Pari Mahal,\u0026nbsp400-year-old\u0026nbspMughal garden overlooking the valley\u0026nbsp(Adam Withnall)Speaking in a cafe where chronic food shortages meant most items were struck off the menu, medical student Aabru Jaan, 22, says she has felt a change in the behaviour of the Indian paramilitary forces since 40 of their officers were killed at Pulwama.“We feel like the soldiers think we are their enemies now,” she said.\u0026nbspShe sympathises with their emotions. “Being a Kashmiri, we all know what it is to lose a family member,” she says. “We have all lost someone. In my village we have lost lives, and youngsters have been injured by pellet guns.”Like Mr Kapra, she says\u0026nbsp“just going out and about” has become a challenge.“There are so many restrictions, more soldiers have been called here, and because the situation has been so intense I feel like Kashmir is no longer safe for Kashmiris,” she says.“Before Pulwama, we felt like the situation was improving – still not normal\u0026nbspbut it was OK. Now this is all leading to a crisis between Pakistan and India, and Kashmir is getting stuck in the middle.”Father of Kashmir suicide bomber defends his son’s actionsIs it safe to go to India given the conflict in Kashmir?Six civilians killed as India and Pakistan continue shelling Tensions rise between India and Pakistan after jets shot downSitting with a friend on the grassy riverbank, 21-year-old computer engineer Mohammad Abrar has a good job and, it would seem, plenty of reason\u0026nbspto be optimistic.\u0026nbspHe says, though,\u0026nbspit has been a week of “sleepless nights” for the city, and “the first time in my life that I had seen tension like this on the streets of Srinagar”.\u0026nbspWhen the jets were flying overhead last week it was “like a scene from a war movie”, he says. “We were very worried, we didn’t feel safe in our homes.”Even if tensions ease a little in the future, he is not optimistic for a long-term solution that might bring hope to the people of Srinagar. “There is no future here for anyone,” he says. “For any child, any man, in any home, there is nothing.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The Kumbh Mela is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at Sangam that dates back to at least medieval times. Pilgrims bathe in the river believing it cleanses them of their sins and ends their process of reincarnation. The event, which UNESCO added to its list of intangible human heritage in 2017, is the largest congregation of pilgrims on earth.

There are no first-class citizens, and there are no second-class voters. We are all equal in the voting booth. We are all represented at the Knesset.”Mr Netanyahu’s\u0026nbspoutburst comes as he is fighting to wrench back support of the right from Benny Gantz, the country’s popular ex-chief of staff who has formed powerful alliance with two former army chiefs and Yair Lapid, a leading centrist opposition figure.The premier had hoped to secure a fourth consecutive term in office making him the longest-serving prime minister in Israeli history.Netanyahu has shattered the illusion that Israel is a democracyNetanyahu says Israel ‘belongs to Jewish people alone’Antisemitism accusations aimed at Ilhan Omar intensifies Israel debateWill Trump’s immoral bribes serve to destroy Palestinian statehood?What did Ilhan Omar say and why has it shaken Washington?But support for his ruling Likud Party has plunged in polls after the country’s prosecutor-general said last month he planned to indict Mr Netanyahu in three corruption cases.The premier is due to face a pre-trial hearing in the coming months, after which the top prosecutor will issue a final decision on whether to send him to trial on a slew of charges including bribery.Mr Netanyahu, who is under pressure to rally the right,\u0026nbsphas come under fire for his comments targeting Israel’s Arab minority, who make up nearly 20 per cent of the population or 1.8 million people.On Monday he wrote on Instagram: “Israel is not a state of all its citizens”“According to the basic nationality law we passed, Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only it,” he concluded.The post was addressed to Israeli model and television actress Rotem Sela who had herself taken to social media to express disgust at anti-Arab comments made by Netanyahu’s firebrand culture minister Miri Regev.Ms Sela had written: “Even the Arabs – believe it or not – are human beings”.Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people – and only itThe Israeli president was not the only prominent figure to criticise the prime minister.Hollywood actor Gal Gadot, best known for her role as Wonder Woman, posted in support of Ms Sela saying late Sunday: “Love your neighbour as yourself.”“This isn’t a matter of right or left. Jew or Arab. Secular or religious,” the Israeli-born actress wrote on Instagram.“It’s a matter of dialogue, of dialogue for peace and security and of our tolerance of one towards the other,” she added.Last month Mr Netanyahu sparked fury in Israel and among powerful pro-Israel lobby groups abroad, when he facilitated a controversial merger between key coalition partner Jewish Home, a nationalist religious party, and the extremist Jewish Power, an offshoot of the banned Kach movement.He also faced backlash for saying Arab parties “not only do not recognise Israel, they are working to eliminate Israel”.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And he has consistently pointed out that the original dream that gave rise to it is under threat.It is exactly 30 years since Sir Tim submitted a paper to his colleagues at CERN, suggesting a way of sharing data across networks,\u0026nbspunder the title Information Management: A Proposal. The humble title belies the importance of what was contained inside, which included a complete sketch for the networked information system that would on to become the internet\u0026nbspwe know today.That would take some time, however. It would take a year-and-a-half for the name WorldWideWeb to be proposed, and it would take many months before the public could actually access a public version of the web even then, it didn\u0027t look anything like the rudimentary graphical pages we associate with the early internet, let alone the huge and complex system you and your computer have navigated to get to this article.That modern web has brought with it a series of technologies that would have seemed impossible and unimaginable at the time the web was first being proposed:\u0026nbspinstant streaming of just about any film you would like to watch and\u0026nbspinternet connections inside of fridges. But it has also brought with it threats, some of which could undermine the very fabric of the web itself.In 2017, when the web turned 28, Sir Tim laid out what he saw as the three challenges that threatened it. All of them are at least as pressing then as they were two years ago, and some were eerily prescient about the ways the web would develop.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe first warning was that we\u0027ve lost control of our personal data. He noted that many websites run on a business model that lets users have free content in exchange for their personal data, which allows them to harvest vast amounts of personal information, which in turn can make the internet a dangerous place to retain any kind of privacy or to discuss important but sensitive topics.Inventor of World Wide Web calls for crackdown on fake newsSince Sir Tim wrote that message, the world was rocked by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and a whole host of other revelations about the amount of data being collected on private people and how it is being used.The second challenge he noted was that it is too easy for misinformation to spread on the web. Noting that most people find news and information on the web through just a handful of social media sites and search engines, he described how websites spreading hoaxes, and false stories can do so relatively easily, and that the system can be gamed to spread that even more quickly.Third, he said that online political advertising needs transparency and understanding. Such advertising is become incredibly sophisticated, he noted, and when combined with the vast amount of data companies like Facebook are tracking can make it very easy to manipulate those people who see it.The scandal over political advertising in events such as the 2016 election and the Brexit vote is still continuing, and campaigners still criticise the relatively limited transparency that has been introduced on platforms that claim to be looking to limit it.A year later, in 2018, he shared another set of challenges, which largely related to the fact that the world has crossed over the point where more people use the web than don\u0027t. That brings a whole host of questions of access and openness, he suggested.The threats that are posed to the web still very much exist, he noted. But I remain committed to making sure the web is a free, open, creative space — for everyone, he wrote last year.By closing the digital ide and helping people get online, stopping the control of the web lying with a small number of very big companies, and by making the discussion around the future of the web more erse, he claimed those threats could be avoided.Sir Tim has been consistent in arguing that the web is really a communal endeavour – and calling on that community to help save it from the threats it is facing.I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what it is today, he wrote in 2017.\u0026nbspAll the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos, applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of millions of you around the world building our online community.That was a vision that was present in the original proposals for the world wide web, begun 30 years ago today. There, Sir Tim described a vision of CERN staff on the web\u0026nbspas several thousand people, many of them very creative, all working toward common goals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Im more motivated to score. We do it for our angels, player Kieran says.The team – which has over  players - was set up by Rob Allen, , after his baby daughter Niamh died in October  at  weeks and  days.While he and his we Charlotte, , had been told at weeks into the pregnancy that she was breach, they had no inkling anything was wrong.Then, days before she was due, a doctor told them there was no heartbeat - and they didnt know why. About one in three stillbirths are unexplained.Our walls just folded in, the carpenter and roofer recalls. It was a horrible, heartbreaking situation to be told that the child you had been planning to welcome home for so long, was not coming.To help him deal with what had happened, Rob started attending his local Sands - stillbirth and neonatal death charity-support group.Then the manager of an old league team he used to play for, Alan, suggested holding a football match to raise money for the charity.They recruited  players who had either lost babies, and raised £,.We saw that it had given those men an opportunity to talk about their experiences, Rob explains. And because everyone had got a huge amount out of it we decided to put the wires out and set up a permanent team.Because were playing in memory of our lost children, theres an extra drive - it gives us that little bit extra in the last  minutes of a game and makes us more of a unit than other Sunday teams who treat it as more of a jokey kickabout, dont mindthey win or lose and might turn up a bit drunk, he adds.Those who have signed up arent just men who have lost their own children, but include a player whose twin was lost at birth, and another whose sister lost a baby. They have very much felt the impact, explains Rob.Then theres those who have suffered from PTSD after nearly losing their partners as well as their baby during childbirth, and have experienced flashbacks and nightmares as a result. One had to seek further help because he was having suicidal thoughts, and his mind was telling him to join his baby.Were now in a time when there is more of a focus on male mental health, and encouraging men to talk and not bottle it up, says Rob. Thats where football comes in - it can feel accessible whereas sitting in a room and being asked whats your name  Whats your story  can feel daunting.The success of the club shows how much this service is needed. Theres already  people interested in starting their own Sands football teams around the UK, and theres been interest in the club in the UK, France, Belgium and Russia.Of Niamhs legacy, Rob - who has a five-year-old son Alfie and has also welcomed newborn daughter Iris - adds: Shes inspired me to do something that has helped local people, and is now touching those across the country and across the world.For Ross Coniam, , from Watford, who joined the team last year, the camaraderie amongst his teammates who have all experienced the loss of a child has been overwhelming.“Some men in the group lost children  years, others in the last one or two years but there’s nothing like being able to talk to someone who knows exactly what you’re feeling when you’re down and having a crap day,” says Ross, who lost his daughter Norah last May just hours after she was born. “It’s still such a taboo subject and some of my friends have never talked to me about it because they don’t know how - but talking about it does help.After a smooth pregnancy, Ross and his we Naomi were excited for the birth of their first baby and had no idea anything was wrong.“But as soon as she was delivered, there was panic,” recalls Ross. “Someone pushed the alarm bell and  to  people doctors piled into the room and started working on her because she wasn’t breathing. It took  minutes to resuscitate her and we knew it wasn’t good.”The baby was taken to the special care unit and hooked up to machines to help her breathe - but the doctors told Ross and Naomi there was no brain activity and there was nothing they could do.“It was so hard to take in,” says Ross. “She weighed lbs and looked absolutely perfect, with a gorgeous smattering of dark hair. After family and friends came to see her, we were taken to a side room so we could hold her for the first and last time.The doctors didn’t think she’d breathe more than a few seconds off the machines, but she lasted half an hour – it was a miracle.They named her Norah Faith, the middle name chosen there and then at the hospital when she was first taken away and there was still some hope. It is the name under the badge on Ross’s team shirt, over his heart, and the name at the forefront of his mind when he meets the team.“Not many people have been through what we’ve been through and it’s such a comfort having them there,” says Ross. “I go to Norah’s grave every week and read her stories like The Hungry Caterpillar, like I would have doneshe had been alive, and it can feel so painful and sad. Naomi is pregnant again now –  weeks – and it’s wonderful but I think I’ll be nervous until we’re out the other side.”Kieran Wright, , a warehouse worker from Northampton, understands all too well what it feels to be nervous about a pregnancy, after his fiancé suffered two miscarriages in two years.“She was eight weeks pregnant when she started to have severe stomach pains,” recalls Kieran. “We got to hospital and after a few tests they told us we’d had a miscarriage. It was so hard. All that good news and excitement about the pregnancy and it had all gone in the blink of an eye.For a while afterwards, I struggled to go to work and didn’t want to leave my fiancé. You can’t even say everything’s going to be alright, because it just isn’t.”The second miscarriage happened a year later in similar circumstances. “This time I could barely eat, didn’t talk. I was just in my own little world. I suppose I’d hit rock bottom, he tells us. We named them Casey and Dot.”He heard about a charity match Sands Utd were playing locally and spoke to Rob the founder and decided to sign up. “The first time I met some of the lads I preferred to listen to their stories than talk, but over time I did open up and let all my emotions out and I’ve never felt so supported, he says.After games we go to the clubhouse and we will talk through how were feeling - other times we will go round each others houses.They’ve since had a rainbow baby – Archie – who is now six months old. “If I feel down, he’ll just smile at me and I cheer up,” says Kieran.When a baby dies the feelings of loneliness and isolation can be overwhelming and having other bereaved parents to talk to is vital, and dads, especially, can sometimes be overlooked.This is why Sands is now working with Rob and the team to develop Sands United FC into a model that can be rolled out across the UK, so that more bereaved families can set up teams to channel their grief and help break the silence around baby loss.Already four new teams have been set up in Kent, Warwickshire, Leicester and Rutland and Grimsby and Cleethorpes and Sands United has a firm social media following, numbering almost  followers on Facebook and almost the same amount on Twitter and Instagram.To find out more about Sands Utd, visit sandsutdfc.

If MPs vote to delay on March , Theresa May will be virtually powerless to refuse France’s demands.

The EU thinks, with justication, that MPs won’t allow No Deal so it feels under no pressure to make signicant concessions.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, is telling the UK thatit doesn’t like the backstop, it can have a Northern Ireland-only version of it — which the UK has already rejected. One minister fully briefed on the negotiations tells me: “We’re at ‘what the hell do we do ’ time.”But without a change to the backstop, Theresa May’s deal is going down to another heavy defeat on Tuesday.That won’t be the end of the matter, though. For the very next day Parliament will vote against leaving on March  with No Deal. Parliament will then almost certainly vote to request an extension to Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU.At this moment, the UK would be in the EU’s hands. As one weary No source admits: “They’d be in a position of being able to dictate terms.”It would be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension, how long it would be for and what conditions would be attached to it. How humiliating: This country’s future would be being determined in Brussels, not Westminster.The EU would almost certainly grant an extension. But what terms it would come with remains to be seen.What should worry those MPs who are voting against Mrs May’s deal because it is not a clean enough Brexit, is what Parliament would do with this extension. I understand that unless the Government indicates that it will allow the Commons to vote on ious Brexit options, an amendment will be tacked on to the extension vote to ensure that “indicative votes” are held.These votes would be on March  and the Commons would move to bind the Government to negotiate what it wants it to.Ministers would have to report back regularly to the Commons on the progress they are making. Mrs May might be in office, but she would not be in power. It is inevitable that the Brexit the Commons would mandate would be softer than Mrs May’s deal.So why, then, are so many Brexiteers not voting for her deal  Well, the problem is that many of them regard it as so flawed that they have no desire to rescue it. They would, in the words of one Cabinet minister: “Rather their hands be clean of all this.”But this isn’t PRACTICAL POLITICS. If Brexiteers won’t back Mrs May’s deal, then Brexit is ONLY GOING TO GET SOFTER.Is there any hope of avoiding this crisis  Today, it looks unlikely. But the DUP does want a deal.While they won’t accept the backstop as it currently is and were, in the words of one source, “not entirely happy” with the proposal Geoffrey Cox took to Brussels, they are eager for an agreement.If progress on the backstop was combined with a commitment from Mrs May that she would step down before phase two of the negotiations, then the deal might pass.I understand that a leading Brexiteer backbencher conveyed this message to influential figures in the Government this week. One normally loyal minister tells me: “If there’s nothing , that is the thing that has to work.”One outcome next week would avoid a crisis: Some progress on the backstop, Mrs May’s deal passing and a new PM coming in to do the next phase of the negotiations. All other roads lead to crisis.But right now, that is where we are headed.LABOUR will, officially, back a second referendum next week.But with as many as  Labour MPs opposed to the idea, it isn’t going to pass the Commons.Jeremy Corbyn has never been enthusiastic about a second referendum – he only backed one to prevent more defections to The Independent Group of MPs.Once he has gone through the motions of supporting one, he will feel free to pivot to other options.This was demonstrated by the fact he had a meeting with the Norway Plus group of MPs this week, who want the UK to stay in the EU single market.A soft Brexit has an obvious appeal for Corbyn. It would offer a solution to the issue while splitting the Tory Party.IT is now looking increasingly likely that the UK won’t be able to get anything on the backstop.“The EU are just not budging,” one of those intimately involved in the negotiations tells me.Bringing back a pretty much unchanged deal for a vote on Tuesday would lead to a heavy defeat for the Government, and probably by a three-figure margin.But there is another option being discussed in government. Gavin Barwell, the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, told ministers this week that one option was to bring to the Commons the proposal that the UK has taken to Brussels. The idea would then be to try to win a vote on that, to prove to the EU that such a change would get the deal through.Right now, one Downing Street source says, there is a “chicken and egg problem” as the EU doesn’t think that what the UK is proposing would get the deal through the Commons, and so doesn’t see the point in engaging with it.Some in government think that doing this would offer a way out of the votes on No Deal and an extension that threaten to create the bitterest Tory split yet over Europe.This strategy is not without risks. It isn’t certain that the Government would win this vote. There is also a danger that holding a vote on a proposal that has been rejected by the EU would end up looking absurd.But walking into a vote knowing that you are going to lose heavily is rarely a sensible governing strategy.ON Wednesday, Alan Duncan urged the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, to have the Government whip against No DealMrs May’s deal is defeated next week.Duncan warned of an eruption from the “moderate” wing of the partythis didn’t happen. Barwell pointed out that Leave ministers have accepted a lot of compromises over the past few years.The exchange demonstrated how dficult the next week will be for the Tories. The votes that would follow Mrs May’s deal failing would make every previous Tory argument over Europe look like small beer.I understand the Government is looking to contain the row through a motion that would say the UK would not leave on March  without a deal, but would try to make clear that it was still an option after that.AS Mrs May was saying there was “no direct correlation between certain crimes and police numbers”, a leaflet from the Tories’ mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey was dropping on London doormats declaring thatthe party took City Hall they would hire , more police “Helping to bring an end to rising crime”.This pledge shows the position the Government has got itself into is politically preposterous.What is needed is more police to deal with the current crisis, then action to stop children from being drawn into these gangs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Great Britain — the world’s fth-largest economy, nuclear power and permanent member of the UN Security Council — has been reduced to an object of international pity.Allies across the Commonwealth, America and even our erstwhile EU partnersare embarrassed to watch a great democracy grovelling before the unelected Burghers of Brussels.EvenAttorney General Geoffrey Cox s today with his famous cod-piece bulging, it’s lose-lose for Brexit.He might persuade enough Tory MPs to vote Mrs May’s botched and rebadged Chequers Deal through Parliament. But it will be at enormous cost.Barring an unlikely last- minute face-saver, Remainers have won this battle and the .million people who voted for Brexit have been comprehensively whipped.We can blame conspirators such as Tony Blair and ex-Chancellor George Osborne. We can point the finger at the BBC, Whitehall and a clutch of Cabinet plotters.We can blame the Brexiteers themselves for tripping over while stabbing each other in the back.And we can certainly blame Phil Hammond for blocking preparations for No Deal — our sole trump card in Brexit negotiations.But in the end, responsibility for this carnage lies with Mrs May. Indeed, thanks to her, Spreadsheet Phil can now bribe MPs with the £billion he saved by selling us down the river.If his chicanery succeeds, there is a remote chance Parliament will support Chequers and sign up to Brino — Brexit In Name Only. It will be a sour “victory”.History might be kind to Mrs May’s decency and her sense of public duty. But it will not ignore the catastrophic blunders which risk condemning this country to permanent vassal status.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt correctly warns Europe has just as much to lose. “This is a moment of change in our relationship between the UK and the EU and history will judge both sides very badlywe get this wrong,” he says.“We want to remain the best of friends. That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn’t poison our relations for many years to come.”Stubborn as she is, Mrs May must know her days as PM are numbered.Losing three babies in quick succession is an unimaginable tragedy in any circumstances.In Shamima Begum’s case it underlines the recklessness of bringing children into the world of terrorist anarchy. Nothing Home Secretary Sajid Javid could have done in the few weeks since she emerged in public is likely to have saved her innocent child.The responsibility lies entirely with Shamima and her jihadi husband, Dutchman Yago Riedijk.There is no chance of her surviving what threatens to be disastrous spring council elections.Certainly there is no question of leading the Government into the next round of EU negotiations, still less risk another general election meltdown.Countless Tory supporters will risk letting Jeremy Corbyn in rather than vote for another May-led government.There is a deal to be had with pro-Brexit MPs who are threatening to inflict a final defeat on Chequers tomorrow.The consequences are unpredictable.If she promises to go by mid-summer, they will vote for her deal. If that works, she will at least be able to claim victory of a kind.It’s a long shot.

If they did, we wouldn’t be in this mess.Some Remainer MPs will back Mrs May’s deal, knowing it’s doomed. It will be their last remotely pro-Brexit act.Once they see Leave MPs pass up perhaps their last chance to secure our exit they will pretend they have done their best by the .million majority and set about defying their will more openly.We wish it were otherwise, but voting down the deal doesn’t lead to No Deal.It leads to Mrs May begging the EU for help which it will not supply because it wants Brexit reversed at any cost.It leads to the panicked postponement of Article , then the softest possible Brexit — unrecognisable to Leavers — or a second referendum the Establishment will do its utmost to skew for Remain.It leads to the upending of our democracy, the possible collapse of the Tory party and the world’s fth biggest economy then being handed over to Marxists and Communists who loathe the West and back anti-Semitic terrorists.Such mayhem should petry everyone. But especially Leave-backing Tories.Yet they are poised to reject a deal which, while very far from perfect, they would have gladly taken had it been offered up before the  referendum.They must think again.ONE thing unites many of Corbyn’s top team: they are rolling in inherited wealth.Take Laura Murray, one of the few self-styled enemies of “the bourgeoisie” who is descended from aristocracy and whose mother sold a Picasso for £million.Or millionaire Seumas Milne, whose papa ran the BBC and sent him to one of Britain’s priciest public schools.Or Corbyn himself, raised in a country manor and sent to prep school.Never having experienced poverty, these super-rich poseurs consider it romantic and noble rather than a trap to be escaped through opportunity.Their failed ideology would turn that poverty into squalor and early graves.But what would these phoney class warriors care  It will never touch them.WE welcome Sajid Javid stripping more terrorist brides of UK citizenship.They deserve nothing from the country they and their genocidal IS husbands swore to overthrow.

Its where we were with the exposure of children to combusted tobacco  years ago.Big tobacco markets e-cigarettes as healthy products without any consideration or warnings about the harms to infants and children.The truth is that all vape products create an invisible plume of nicotine and ultrafine toxic particles that spreads into the air and coats surfaces.Do people really want to wait another  years to see how this corporate experiment ends E-cigarettes are recommended by the NHS as a means of helping smokers quit their habit.The health service states the devices do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the main toxins in conventional cigarette smoke.But studies have found the vapour does contain other harmful chemicals, though at lower levels than cigarette smoke, the NHS states.It adds on its website: E-cigarettes are still fairly new and we will not have a full picture on their safety until they have been in use for many years.But according to current evidence... they carry a fraction of the risk of cigarettes.Last week another expert admitted he has banned his family from using e-cigarettes after his team found they increase the risk of heart attacks and depression.Other studies have shown flavoured e-liquids destroy lungand trigger deadly diseases.While other links have been found between vaping and the risk of stroke.So while they may be safer for smokers looking to quit, theres mounting evidence the devices are not harm-free.The new findings are published in the journal Pediatrics.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Leave won by  per cent to  per cent.People now talk about “soft” and “hard” Brexit in reference to how close the UK will be to the EU post separation.The road to triggering Article  — which saw Britain officially start the process of leaving the EU — was paved with complications for the PM, including a Supreme Court case ruling MPs needed to vote on Brexit negotiations.But it was finally triggered on March , , meaning the official departure date and move into the transition phase is due to take place on March , .EU chiefs are drawing up a plan to delay Brexit until  to do away with a need for any Irish backstop.Under the latest thinking in Brussels, Britain’s  month transition period after exit day on March  would be scrapped for continuing membership instead.The move would mean a trade deal could be agreed by the end of December , leaving no need for a backstop that Brexiteers argue will trap the UK forever.The idea to break the current deadlock is favoured by EU Council President Donald Tusk, but would be bitterly opposed by Leave backing MPs.It emerged as Theresa May held talks with EU leaders in the margins of a desert summit in a desperate bid to show progress before the next showdown Commons vote.In a positive sign for the PM, Irish leader Leo Varadkar appeared to give ground by saying he would agree to offering reassurances the backstop would be temporary.Eleventh hour talks for a new Brexit deal were on the verge of collapse this week as EU chiefs clashed bitterly with Cabinet ministers in Brussels.British and EU negotiators hit deadlock over a compromise on the Irish backstop.No admitted that Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s meeting with Michel Barnier was “dficult” and the pair had “a robust exchange of views” – diplomatic code for a blazing row.Mrs May jetted to Strasbourg for last-minute negotiations ahead of a meaningful vote on March  - the outcome of which could determine the UKs departure from the EU.The transition period is a bridging agreement between the current situation – where we are members of the EU – and our long-term relationship outside the bloc.Also known as an implementation phase, it allows for the UK to keep some of the same arrangements with Brussels on trade and other matters until a new comprehensive trade agreement is sealed.In March , Britain secured a transition deal that will also allow ministers to seek trade agreements around the globe.The UK will also be free to set its own foreign policy as soon as Brexit happens, as well as negotiate and sign new trade deals anywhere in the world – to implement them in .However EU chiefs made it clear the period, which allows the UK to stay in the Single Market and Customs Union, will only come into forcethe Irish border is sorted.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled terms for the  month interim period.The UK will not be fully out of the EU until December ,  – four and a half years after the historic referendum decision.But EU leaders have suggested they could extend the transition period further.The European Union is an economic and political partnership. There are currently  members states including the United Kingdom.It began as a trade group of six nations in the s.The UK first applied to join what was then the European Economic Community in  and finally became a member in .Now called the European Union, it has grown to include former Soviet bloc states and has at its heart a “single market” allowing goods and people to move freely.It has its own parliament, central bank and the euro currency used by  countries, with some members including Britain opting to keep their own money.Eurocrats have been pushing for ever closer political and financial union, which could include a European Army separate from the Nato alliance.Those in favour of leaving said Britain was being held back by EU red tape with too many rules on business.They also campaigned on the issue of sovereignty and said they wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders.Beyond the question of ceasing to be a member of the EU, what Brexit actually means in practice has been the subject of intense debate ever since."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004608994771.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"second eu referendum brexit vote","story":"But how likely is a second vote before the UK leaves the EU on March   We take a look, below.Theresa May has spoken repeatedly against a second referendum, at one point saying it could threaten the UKs social cohesion.She said it would set a dficult precedent and that the implications for the country were serious.In fact at every turn, the Tories have ruled out any possibility of a Peoples Vote.An analysis by Reuters indicated there was no majority in British parliament for a second Brexit referendum among lawmakers.The study came ahead of a crunch meaningful vote on March .On the eve of the vote Mrs May jetted off to Strasbourg to beg the EU to give ground in last minute talks in a bid to avoid yet another humiliating defeat in the Commons.If Parliament fail to reach an agreement this week it could result in a No Deal, or the PM would have to request an extension from the EU - which theyve shown themselves unwilling to do.After months of resisting pressure within his party, Jeremy Corbyn finally said Labour would back another EU referendum after his alternative Brexit plan was defeated on February .His U-turn came after eight MPs quit the party to form the Independent Group.But Labour has now apparently pulled back from pushing for a second referendum ahead of a week of crunch votes on a Brexit deal.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would focus on trying to rule out a no-deal Brexit and the government’s “bad deal”.One way Corbyn might try to achieve a second referendum would be through an amendment drawn up by backbenchers Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson.Mr Kyle however signalled he would not be bringing it to the table on March , saying: “I want to have the targets in my sights before pulling the trigger . . . There is a lot of interest in this but it may be that people come to it when they have exhausted other opportunities, that’s why we haven’t tabled it earlier.”Betfair has put the odds at  evens that there will be another Brexit referendum and   there wont.While Paddy Power has put the odds at   there will not be another referendum and  evens that there will be.A poll carried out by YouGov on March  revealed that  per cent believe Remain would winthere was a second referendum,  per cent say the same for Leave and  per cent would be undecided.From February  to March , the proportion of people who think there will be a second referendum jumped from  per cent to  per cent..The SNP have said they would back a so-called Peoples Vote and a number of Conservative MPs have also backed one.So there could be a majority in Parliament for it but a second referendum will not happen quickly and the first stage is for there to be an Act of Parliament.That will require the backing of a majority of MPs and it took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in .Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February , and the vote taking place on  June.But the Electoral Commission has said in future there should be at least a six-month gap to allow enough time to register campaigns and put counting officers in place.There is also the question of what to do about Article .This could be avoidedthe EU agreed to extend the Article  deadline - but that would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states.Then there is the question of what to put on the ballot paper.If there are three questions - for example accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU or leave with no deal - then just  per cent could decide the winning option.The first referendum on EU membership took place in .Two-thirds of votersbacked the continued membership of the European Economic Community, which the UK had joined only two years before.Under Harold Wilsons leadership, the Labour Party was trying to present to the public a dferent version of EEC membership to get a better deal.The EEC was integrated into the European Union after it was created in .In June , Britain voted to leave the EU after .million people backed Leave compared to .million Remain voters."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004633896091.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what is brexit deal and what happens next","story":"Deal, No deal and extension are all still on the cards -

The former foreign secretary blew more than pound, of taxpayer’s cash on a visit to Kabul, which allowed him to miss a crunch vote on Heathrow expansion in June last year. Officials blamed an “IT issue” after details of the embarrassing trip were slipped out to a member of the public, while journalists’ requests were delayed. And following a six month battle, the Foreign Office was forced to admit they had internally identied requests from “known journalists”, breaking Freedom of Informationrules. And officials refused to reveal details of the ‘IT issue’ due to “national security” concerns. FOI expert Matt Burgess said: “Its outrageous, the law is meant to be applicant and motive blind. “This seems like a cover-up where the government is trying to hide information from journalists because they want an easier ride.”   He added: “Everyone should get the same responses to FOI requests, no matter who they are.” Shameless Mr Johnson travelled to Kabul on an last-minute visit on the same day he would have been forced to vote in favour of Heathrow expansion to keep his job. Mr Johnson once claimed he would lie down in front of the bulldozers to stop the poundbn plan for a third runway. Details of the trip were quietly disclosed to a member of the public in response to an FOI request. But they were not revealed to the Mirror and at least one other publication until a complaint was lodged, days later. The Foreign Office last night denied that it had deliberately held back the information from the media, or treated members of the press dferently to members of the public. But in emails dealing with the request, one official told colleagues: “I’m happy to clear these but can you provide a list of who they are from ”   Another email confirmed an official had “provided details of any known journalists.” The Information Commissioner’s guidance bans public bodies from dferentiating journalists from members of the public when dealing with FOI requests. It’s understood the Foreign Office did suffer an IT problem on the day the data was originally disclosed. But officials have been unable to explain why it affected some applicants and not others. And the department refused to make details of the IT problem public, saying it would be a threat to national security. A further request, for details of how the case had been managed by the Foreign Office, was delayed six time beyond its  working day time limit. Eventually the department revealed some of the information a full  working days late, without providing any explanation.

The standard waiting time for the benefit, paid to .million claimants and counting, is five weeks. The recommendation is made by the liberal Conservative-leaning think tank Bright Blue in a major report on reforming UC.

The case examiner could set standards for the DWP, such as delivering payment on time, as well as standards for the claimants. The amount of compensation issued to UC claimants should to some degree mirror the amount lost by claimants because of sanctions, Bright Blue said. Specically, the financial compensation offered to claimants as a result of non-compliance by DWP should be tiered according to the number of weeks a claimant has waited for their UC award. The Bright Blue report also recommended the DWP introduce a UC phone app and a live chat facility, and cap the number of claimants dealt with by each work coach.   The think tank said a certain amount of overpayments by the DWP should be disregardedthe government made the mistake. And it recommended a relaxing of the Minimum Income Floor, a cap on benefits for self-employed claimants that is currently being challenged in the High Court.  Ryan Shorthouse, Director at Bright Blue and co-author of the report, said: “Universal Credit has plenty of potential. A majority of claimants are coping with and adapting to Universal Credit. There are positive experiences with work coaches. And there are positive attitudes too: especially towards the single payment model and the use of conditionality. “However, as it has gone from idea to implementation, the initial widespread support Universal Credit enjoyed has dissipated. Despite welcome improvements made by the Government in recent years, there are too many examples and too much evidence of signicant hardship experienced by a sizable minority of those on Universal Credit.” A DWP spokesperson said: “We welcome the report’s finding that the majority of people have had a smooth move onto Universal Credit, appreciating the simple monthly payment and work coach support. “Universal Credit is a force for good, supporting over . million people. The majority of claimants are happy with the service and where challenges remain, we will continue to make improvements.” "},{"url":null,"title":"universal credit up 800000 claimants","story":"NewsUniversal Credit: Up to , claimants moved to new regime without full supportSome .million people are now on Universal Credit - and its Director General has revealed \"roughly half\" of those joining are existing claimants in the benefit systemShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video universal-credit-new-regime-move-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA DWP chief tonight appeared to suggest around , benefit claimants have been forced onto Universal Credit without transition cash. Neil Couling, UC Director General, told MPs roughly half of those joining the six-in-one system are existing benefit claimants whose circumstances have changed. As of January this year, .million people were on UC.Existing benefit claimants who are moved to UC will have a transition fund to ensure their income doesnt drop, in a trial that starts in Harrogate this July and only rolls out fully in .But these protections do not apply to people whose circumstances change.   MPs have heard this so-called natural migration is triggered by changes in circumstances as small as a relationship breakup or a childs fth birthday.Labour MP Neil Coyle said the move was having a terrible impact on many peoples lives.Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field said: People moving over are stranded. They dont have enough money.  In a hearing of the committee today, Mr Coyle asked what message the new trial sent to those who have already moved. He told Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd: What are we, five years in  And youre beginning a new pilot to see how Universal Credit works Independent Group MP Heidi Allen added: Its pushing people under the water. Ms Rudd replied to the MPs: It has always been the case thatyou change your circumstances and need to apply for new benefit, you may find that the situation of the benefits that are being proposed have changed. But Ms Allen said it was a problem hitting people whod moved two yards down the road. Asked how many people had had a change of circumstances, Mr Couling told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: “It is hard to give a precise estimate. Because obviously it depends on the number of changes of circumstances that occur in a period, and that itself could be determined by economic and other factors. “But roughly it’s about half and half of caseload growth is through a change in circumstance - and half is through a pure new claim to benefit.  Policy in Practice warned % of UC claimants who move through natural migration lose out by an average of pound a week compared to the old system. Meanwhile % are expected to gain by pound a week, the think tank told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee.Asked to respond to the suggestion , people had moved through natural migration, a DWP spokesperson said: “Only new claimants or people who have undergone a change in circumstances are currently being asked to apply for Universal Credit .Where someone’s circumstances change it’s right that we reassess their entitlement to ensure they’re receiving the right level of support.” Ms Rudd admitted the initial rollout of UC, and the wait for payments, did I believe contribute to the growth of food banks” but insisted reasons are “ied”, and since the period she was talking about there’s been “vast improvement”. Meanwhile, Amber Rudd told MPs the four-year freeze on most working-age benefits will stay until March , but she expected it will end after that. I have private conversations with the Chancellor, she said.And she revealed the DWP have drawn up plans to hire extra staff in a No Deal Brexit .The Work and Pensions Secretary told a committee of MPs: “We have been making preparations for no deal planning. “We are making sure thatthere is an economic downturn, we are prepared to hire additional people should there be fewer jobs available as a result of a no deal exit.” She also confirmed reports the government overall has been looking at the possibility of a “hardship fund”there is no deal.

Chloe Wilkinson, , and Patraic Walsh-Kavanagh, , were travelling back to the UK to tell their parents about the surprise pregnancy. But Chloe went into labour during a stopover in Singapore and gave birth to their son Lorcan, who weighed just .lbs. He is currently in intensive care and will have to stay in hospital for at least the next three months.    Chloe and Patraic took out travel insurance ahead of their once-in-a-letime trip, which began in December . But the policy didnt cover the unexpected pregnancy. Teaching assistant Chloe said: Lorcan’s been fighting with all his might and we are bursting with pride at the strength he is showing so far. “However, we are on our own, a  hour flight away from our family and friends, and it has been a very dficult start to parenthood whilst Lorcan remains in hospital.    Its still such a huge shock to us both that hes here but were doing everything we possibly can to ensure we all get back to the UK. Patraic added: We were in a complete state of shock and fear completely took over as we were faced with a severely premature baby with potentially multiple health issues whilst being stuck in a country with no support. “On top of this I was handed an estimated bill of poundk [, SGD] assuming there will be no further complications with Chloe or the baby. Teaching assistant Chloe and Patraic left the UK in December  to go travelling around Asia.    They then found work together in Australia before discovering Chloe was pregnant last November. The couple, who wanted to tell their parents the news in person, began flying home last month. But during a two-day stopover in Singapore Chloe was rushed to hospital after experiencing bleeding and cramps. Doctors told her she had started dilating at just  weeks - meaning flying home was no longer an option. Patraic, from Nottingham, East Mids, said: All the doctors and nurses seemed very concerned.   After numerous tests it was found that she had an infection so she was started on antibiotics and medication to reduce contractions and prolong labour to give baby the best chance of survival. However, Chloe, from Lincoln, fell more seriously ill and medics decided they had to deliver Lorcan immediately. She said: I was absolutely terried because I knew it was too early. When my water broke the room was quickly filled with doctors, midwives and paediatricians As soon as he was delivered he went straight into an incubator where the paediatricians started to help him breathe and stabilise him before whisking him off to intensive care. Hes fighting and doing his best but we feel so helpless.    Lorcan is currently in intensive care while his parents are living in a shared flat near the hospital. Their lack of working visas means they are unable to seek employment to support themselves. So the couple are trying to raise as close to pound, on GoFundMe to help pay for Lorcans hospital bills. By Monday afternoon they had raised more than pound,. Chloe added: Were professional people who work hard but its obviously a huge sum and anything anyone can offer to help would be greatly appreciated. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at home and across the world for their continued love and support.

Mum-of-three Laura McQueenie has been plagued by the germ-carrying animals at her council flat in Niddrie, Edinburgh, where she lives with her sons and young niece. The -year-old said the living conditions were disgraceful and describing overflowing bins as a health hazard. After the birth of her youngest son seven months ago, the social work student began to realise the scale of the problem. Laura said: Two rats have died in my kitchen sink and there are many more we have seen.   Every evening I hoover and sanitise all surfaces before bed. When I wake in the morning there are rat droppings all over the kitchen workspaces, window sill – they are even inside the bread bag. There are droppings all over the living room window sills, the floors. The young mum lives with her sons, aged eight, two and seven months, as well as her -month old niece. Laura said problems with rats were affecting the health of her youngest child - and said poison poured into the rodents’ holes did nothing to solve the problem. “The flat is absolutely disgraceful and it’s disgusting that we have to stay here because there’s nowhere  suitable for us. It’s been horric living here and it’s heartbreaking that I have no other option.   “I now go to my mum’s during the day because I can’t bear to be there. It’s filthy. The bins outside are a severe health hazard and I’ve been down with rubber gloves trying to clean some of it.” Pest control firm Wee Critters Pest Control estimated that there was a  per cent increase in call-outs year on year, while owner Sylvia Hill said amateur poisons bought by concerned residents would barely make a dference to the problem. Sylvia believes the Gorgie area of Edinburgh could be the worst in Scotland for rat infestations - and described the problem as a plague. She said: “We are struggling with the high demand at the moment. Ive had to share some of our jobs with other pest control companies. The city centre is full of rat problems but Gorgie is the worst area by far and possibly the worst in Scotland. We are honestly never out of there. Some of the problems are caused by laziness to be honest.   Rather than opening the bin lid to throw away the rubbish, people are leaving their rubbish and dog poo at the side of their bins.” She added: I have seen people buying amateur rat poison but although it may kill a mouse or two, adult mice and rats are hardly affected by it. The rats are just a major issue in Edinburgh at the moment. A total of , pest control requests were received by the City of Edinburgh Council last year with the Forth, Sighthill Gorgie and Craigentinny Duddingston wards proving to be the most problematic areas of the city. And there were , complaints about missed bin collections. However, although it appears that the rat population is increasing, the local authority said it had not experienced a signicant increase in vermin callouts. Cllr Lesley Macinnes, convener for Transport and Environment, said: We remain surprised by these comments and would be interested in hearing from the pest control firm, as this information goes against our evidence of what is happening in the city.

The self-confessed health fanatic insists the move is in the best interests of pupils.   She said: First of all, Im not the head teacher of all evil and saying no. Ive banned birthday sweets because they were becoming a huge problem in the school and mean the children were consuming processed sugar almost every day. Mrs Crawford-Usher, from New England, America, admits she wasnt allowed sweets growing up and claims her mother was a Whole Foods mum before it was trendy. She noted that children are provided with healthy and wholesome school dinners such as spaghetti bolognese, shepherds pie and roast dinners - all made with fresh ingredients.The strict head of Wateringbury Primary School also said desserts were on the table but they too were natural and unprocessed.  Despite the drastic measures, Mrs Crawford-Usher claimed students and parents have seldom complained. She said: People are angry about it for about a week and then it just becomes normal. I really havent had much of a backlash. Children can eat and drink whatever they want when they get home, I just want to provide them with healthier choices at school. The dental problems among schoolchildren now are awful and I want to do what I can to prevent it.   Its a terribly traumatic ordeal for a child to have their tooth extracted and its something I want to avoid. It comes after recent figures revealed ,  under-s needed tooth extractions last year. Public Health England estimated that youngsters were eating around eight more cubes of sugar per day than the recommended guidelines.However, Mrs Crawford-Ushers decision has come under fire on social media from Olympic race walker Tom Bosworth.He said: Again, common sense needs to be used here. Really what is happening to society to ban kids from having sweets on their birthday. - ban them every other dayyou like, but let a child be a child on their birthday though. The head hit back and said the Olympian had perhaps missed the point. She said: Yes, I think pupils should be able to eat sweets on their birthday buteach and every child brings them in to celebrate, the children would be eating them nearly every day. Also it puts an unfair pressure on parents to bring in sweets when perhaps they dont agree with them. Wateringbury CE Primary School is based near Maidstone, Kent.   Its mission statement reads: Our vision...to be an excellent primary school at the heart of the community where we inspire, excite and enable children to achieve.

The school had previously banned sugary drinks like fizzy sodas and fruit juices too.

The family would later claim they saw him carrying a girl, wearing pink and white pyjamas, down a quiet street around m from the beach. And US criminal profiler Pat Brown believes the sighting is the key in Madeleines case, which has yet to be solved more than a decade on. This is the number one issue about the whole case, and Ive stuck by this for years, and I stand by it today, she told  News in a podcast. Madeleine was just three when she vanished from an apartment in Praia da Luz, where she had been sleeping with her twin siblings.   At the time, her parents Kate and Gerry were dining with pals nearby.The reported sighting by the Smiths was at around pm on May , . The same night, a friend of Kate and Gerry also reportedly saw a dark-haired man carrying a child away from the direction of the apartment.But this sighting, by Jane Tanner, was reported to be  minutes before the Smiths one and was in a dferent location, the news site reports. Jane claimed she had gone for a walk when she saw, in the darkness and from some distance, a man carrying a child across the road ahead.“What makes the Smith sighting very interesting is that Jane Tanner is a friend, and the Smith sighting is a bunch of people that have no clue who the McCanns are, Pat, from Washington DC, says in the Maddie podcast.   These are not their friends. She adds: I believe the Smith sighting occurred. I believe they saw a man carrying a little girl down that road, which is towards the beach. E-fits of a suspect, based on evidence from holidaymaker Martin Smith and his family, were unveiled years after Madeleines disappearance.Meanwhile, an artist drew an impression of the so-called Tannerman - the man spotted by Jane, who was considered a suspect for years. Pats comments are made in the third episode of the podcast, which looks into the high-profile case and the two sightings that night.According to  News, the criminal profiler has studied the case in exhaustive detail, even flying out to visit Praia da Luz itself. Madeleine would now be , turning  in May this year.In November , Operation Grange, the Met Police investigation into her disappearance, was given a further pound, from the Home Office. This provided funding up to March  this year. The podcast is hosted by Australian journalist Mark Saunokonoko. A Netflix documentary about the case is set to be broadcast next month. Kate and Gerry earlier released a statement about the Netflix show. They said: We are aware that Netflix are planning to screen a documentary in March  about Madeleine’s disappearance.  The production company told us that they were making the documentary and asked us to participate.We did not see and still do not see how this programme will help the search for Madeleine and, particularly given there is an active police investigation, could potentially hinder it.

Kate and William werent far behind them and the two royal women had a sweet reunion when they met inside the beautul abbey. They kissed each other on both cheeks, and both women did the same to their brother-in-law, just as Prince Charles and Camilla arrived.  Meghan wore a cream Victoria Beckham dress featuring a locks and chain pattern, teamed with a chic hat and green suede heels. Kate opted for a bright red knee- button down coat, beige heels and a Gina Foster hat.  The Queen looked lovely in purple with a stunning silver jeweled broach. She praised how the Commonwealth inspires its member states to find ways of protecting the planet and it citizens. In a written message, the monarch said: In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our  nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people.  We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw. With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real.

Alison Whateley, , can now be named as the vile nursery boss who was caught holding a video conference meeting with other child abusers on her mobile phone. The offender was spared jail last week after a y National Crime Agencyinvestigation. A judge today ruled it was in the public interest for the woman to be identied. He told Guildford Crown Court she worked at Bushy Tails Day Nursery and Pre-school in Teddington, south-west London, but none of her offences involved kids from that nursery. The establishment today said it was saddened to hear of Whateleys sick acts.  Whateley told other online child porn users that babies were f****** sexy as she showed the depth of her depravity in recordings and live stream chatroom sessions. She shared her fantasies of abuse of young children online with online lovers with whom she watched graphic images of child abuse online. Whateley, of Farnham, Surrey, used her iPhone to access online chatroom Zoom in , where anonymous hosts had played videos of children as young as three years old being raped. She admitted initiating, encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely the distribution of indecent images of children, but was allowed to walk free from court on Thursday. Sentencing, Judge Peter Moss said: A psychiatrist found that you gave a less than compelling reason for why you were viewing this material, to be seeking to entrap paedophiles as some sort of paedophile hunter. You have accepted that is not correct because of your inactivity in doing something about it. The court had heard an undercover officer for the NCA was deployed in the video conference call Whateley held in . Steven Talbot-Hadley, prosecuting, said: At the relevant time this defendant worked as a manager at a nursery.  An undercover investigation was underway by the National Crime Agency focused on the online conferencing  Zoom, which is otherwise legitimate but known to be used by paedophiles for sharing images of child abuse online. An undercover officer was deployed in the meeting. It was in this way that this defendant was discovered. What the court is concerned with is the involvement in a Zoom meeting on August , . On that occasions the defendant was present for just under an hour under the username XXX. The court heard that during this time  participants viewed  videos showing children as young as three to five being sexually abused and raped. During this time, Whateley actively participated when she typed into the live chat that she liked masturbating over boys and girls, the younger the better, and she particularly liked babies, saying they were so f****** sexy. And she asked the other users: Anybody interested in very tiny children  Caroline Moonan, defending, read out a statement by Whateley, which said: I struggle to explain my actions. One day I accidentally found a chatroom with paedophilic material. I didnt really have a plan, I did not really know what I was trying to do. Ms Moonan said: When she looks back at her actions now she is disgusted with herself. She simply cant understand why she behaved in the way she did. She will never work with children again. She was so good at looking after children and so good at protecting children.  Her job became very stressful and she couldnt sleep. She started using the internet more and more. She saw a chatroom about children and she thought it was something like MumsNet. When she saw went in, she found it was paedophiles talking about abusing children.

Geoffrey Crossland today admitted to storing prohibited firearms in an underground bunker at his home in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. When officers raided the sprawling Padside Green Farm property, they found guns hidden underneath it, along with ammunition. Police had been investigating the -year-old after he was found to have amassed more than . million indecent images. The horric pictures were described by the Crown Prosecution Service as one of the biggest known collections in England and Wales.  North Yorkshire Police said their seizure was the biggest in the county, and included , images in the most extreme category A. Appearing at York Crown Court earlier today, Crossland admitted  charges in relation to the possession of firearms and ammunition. He had previously pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent images between January  and October . And this afternoon, the defendant was sentenced to  years and eight months behind bars by His Honour Judge Andrew Stubbs. Sentencing Crossland, the judge said: A search on your home led to the discovery of an enormous amount of indecent images of children.  In a locked box, devices and hard drives there was also a discovery of carefully stored images of many years dating back to . These were systematic searches, some of which found children between - being raped and others of young girls receiving a signicant amount of sexual abuse. Crosslands home was raided while he was holidaying abroad last year.He was arrested on histo Heathrow Airport in an operation conducted by police and the National Crime Agency . Stephen Wood, prosecuting, told the court: It [the bunker] was fitted with electrics and from there they recovered USBs, sim cards, external hard drives, laptops, computers, tablets, floppy disks and DVDs. Among the evidence there was a worrying document which had been created with login details so he [Crossland] couldnt forget which websites to access.  There was also websites on the documents listed with where he could access the best websites for indecent images of children and where he could share the information without being suspected. He even categorised the websites by the content and who had made them. Susannah Proctor, defending, said: The bunker at his home was made in  from storage containers which he applied for permission. He worked from his home at that time for his business creating manufactured electrical components. He possessed the firearms because he was an enthusiast and had been since he was  years old. This was also a hobby he shared with his father. Former businessman Crossland was jailed for five years for the possession of indecent images,  months for possessing moving images of a young girl, and six years for the illegal possession of firearms.  He was also issued with a ten-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order and placed on the sex offenders register for ten years. Detective Chief Inspector Graeme Wright, of North Yorkshire Police, was the senior investigating officer in the case. He said: This is without doubt the largest ever seizure of indecent images of children in the history of North Yorkshire Police. The investigation as a whole has been on a scale never seen before in our area regarding this type of offending. More than  digital devices were seized from an office area above the underground bunker complex on Crosslands premises. Each device had to undergo painstaking examination by North Yorkshire Polices Digital Forensic Unit supported by a team of specialist officers from the National Crime Agency.  There was also the recovery of the prohibited firearms and ammunition. We knew that Crossland had, legitimately, been an active member of shooting clubs over the years and he had acquired a large collection of firearms-related items and ammunition which he stored in the bunker. Nevertheless, everything had to be seized and carefully assessed to determine what was and what wasnt legally held. Marc Horsfall, of the National Crime Agency, said: A team of specially trained NCA officers spent several months working through Crosslands horric catalogue of abuse images to grade them in order of severity. Crossland and men like him are fuelling the actual contact abuse of children and the sickening distribution of those images. The NCA works with partners at home and abroad to catch child sex offenders and bring them to justice.

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arrived at Westminster Abbey moments later for the Commonwealth event, to celebrate its  countries and . billion people. Meghan and Kate kissed each other on both cheeks and their brothers-in-law, just as the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall arrived. Kate, , was pictured in a knee- button down coat, beige heels and a Gina Foster pillbox hat.   Meghans Victoria Beckham outfit, a chic cream number, is believed to retail at more than pound,. The dress features prints of locked chains. The Queen has also arrived at the service. She complimented her purple outfit with a silver jeweled broach. In other pictures, Prime Minister Theresa May could be seen arriving at the abbey, wearing a feathered hat and a brightly coloured necklace.  She smiled and held on to her hat as she walked towards the abbey.The Queen today praised how the Commonwealth inspires its member states to find ways of protecting the planet and it citizens.In a written message, the monarch said: In April last year, I welcomed the leaders of our  nations to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and we all witnessed how the Commonwealth vision offers hope, and inspires us to find ways of protecting our planet, and our people. We are able to look to the future with greater confidence and optimism as a result of the links that we share, and thanks to the networks of co-operation and mutual support to which we contribute, and on which we draw.   With enduring commitment through times of great change, successive generations have demonstrated that whilst the goodwill for which the Commonwealth is renowned may be intangible, its impact is very real. Earlier today, Meghan and Harry had visited Canadas High Commission in London, where they got an insight into Canadian culture. In a stark contrast, Meghan wore a custom green wool embellished coat and matching dress by Canadian and Turkish fashion designer Erdem for this .  She teamed it with towering black Aquazzura Deneuve bow heels, which she has worn on a number of occasions and cost around pound, a pound, black satin Givenchy clutch, and yellow gold and opal earrings. The couple watched youngsters, whose parents work at the commission, making and eating Canadas quintessential sugary treat - maple taffy. Maple syrup was poured on to crushed ice and, as it hardened, the children rolled it onto a stick and quickly devoured the delicacy traditionally served at this time of year from sugar shacks in the woods.   After watching the youngsters and listening as Harry asked how many of these are you allowed , the Duchess tried making one for herself. She then gave it to nine-year-old Elodie-Rose Dugua-Inegbese. The schoolgirl said about being given Meghans taffy: I was so excited. She said does anyone want one  And she said to me would you like it  Thenhanded it to me. It was really fun meeting Meghan and shes really pretty and was really friendly. The Duchess has an affinity with Canada, having spent seven years working in the country, mostly based in Toronto, when filming the hit series Suits.   Harry and Meghan were invited to Canada House to meet the cream of Canadian talent in the UK, from tech entrepreneurs and artists to business people and fashion designers. Canadas High Commissioner to the UK Janice Charette said: We kind of claim them a little bit as Canadians for two reasons one of course because of the duchess long timeshes worked in Canada both in Toronto and Vancouver. But as well, one of their first outings as a couple was actually at the Invictus Games in Toronto so we like to think of them as having come home here to Canada House. She added that it was signicant hosting the royal visit in the th anniversary year of the formation of the modern Commonwealth.   The high commissioner said: For me, the chance to have them here and focus on Canadian youth, withthe youth ambassador of the Commonwealth and the duchess, who has responsibilities with the Commonwealth Trust most newly, this is about the future of the Commonwealth, talking to the young people. Before leaving, the couple were given clothes for their baby. Meghan said Oh Hudsons Bay goodies when the gt box was opened and she recognised a tiny striped hat and mittens. Harry, meanwhile, made a crowd of high commission staff laugh when he picked up a tiny pair of Manitobah Mukluks - moccasins - and snfed them to seethey were real leather.The final present was an organic cotton Canadian maple leaf decorated baby bodysuit.

Four-star guest house The Lighthouse, in Frome, is said to hosting a group called Universal Medicine. A civil court in Australia found Universal Medicine makes  claims about healing in a defamation case last December, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. It found that cult founder Serge Benhayon used bizarre forms of sexual manipulation and persuaded followers to shun loved ones who wouldnt join his cult. SomersetLive reports that the groups website say UK courses are presented at \u2028The Lighthouse Accommodation and B  B in Frome, Somerset Serge has always denied running a cult and any wrong doing, saying he is the victim of a media witch hunt.  The cult also faced claims that breast massages were used as an alternative to modern medicine. The group was founded in  by Serge - a former bankrupt tennis coach who claims to be the reincarnation of Leonardo da Vinci. Serge now lives as a millionaire in Australia but twice a year he is said to visit the cults BB in the Somerset village of Tytherington, near Frome. Two families have claimed alienated them from their loved ones from them. Kasha said she was  when her mum started following Universal medicine.  She told the BBC: I realised that she wasnt mum any more, so that was quite dficult. Kasha claimed her mum started to act bizarrely after joining the cult She said: She started burping ridiculously and she said Im just burping out bad spirits. Kasha says she realised there was no hope and she would just have to let her mum go. I think Serge is a cruel man with cruel intentions. I genuinely think hes a monster, she said. Shes still my mum and I love her. But shes never going to be the person that she was or the person I even remember her to be. Another man, John, told the BBC that Universal Medicine alienated his we and daughter from him. He said: Its the way they get inside peoples heads and brainwash them into doing this that are not natural.   Members are allegedly told what to eat, when to sleep and who to mix with. Simon Williams, managing director of the Lighthouse, is a follower of Universal Medicine and a friend of Serges. Hes also president of the Frome Chambers of Commerce. He told a BBC reporter that the court ruling in Australia was totally untrue and people didnt understand what Universal Medicine was about. Last year Mr Benhayon took a former patient to court in Australia for defamation. Esther Rockett had been blogging about his practices, claiming he indecently touched her during an oian reading.

As part of this planning, Theresa, who lives in Dublin, knows the event will take place at a castle venue and Christina Perris A Thousand Years is going to be the song she and her husband have their first dance to - as shes been waiting for what feels like a thousand years to find the one.She also knows what food will be served on the day , what kind of shoes shes going to wearand that she wants to spend the honeymoon in Disneyland.And while some may think its odd to have so much planned without even being engaged, the mum disagrees, arguing that its sensible as there will be very little left to worry about when the time comes.  Her idea to plan the wedding was sparked when she and her partner broke up after six years of dating and having two kids together.The pair had discussed marriage, but sadly the relationship just didnt work out the way shed thought it would.Following the split, she decided she wouldnt let her lack of a prince charming stop her from getting on with her le and achieving her dream of getting married, so she started working out what she wanted.

Along the way, Carmine “The Snake” Persico is suspected of killing  people and ordering hits on hundreds more, while surviving attempts on his own le – in one legendary incident by catching a bullet in his teeth.Now The Snake is sleeping with the fishes after dying in jail, aged , on Thursday.He grew up in the golden age of New York’s La Cosa Nostra, its five notorious crime families battling for supremacy. Persico wanted a slice of the action, dismissing his ft in stature and using his razor- sharp intelligence to rise to kingpin of the Colombo family, becoming known as “The Snake” as he double-crossed rival families to slither to power. And even after his luck ran out, and he was jailed for  years in , he continued to rule from behind bars, taking out contracts on those who dared to mess with the master.   He never broke the mafia’s Omertagrave, code of silence, and was “an old-school tough guy”, according to Frank Dimatteo, who grew up in the mob and co-wrote biography Carmine the Snake: Carmine Persico and His Murderous Mafia Family. Dimatteo says: “He’s a throwback to the real gangsters, not like these make-believe gangsters. You gotta give him respect for it.” Carmine John Persico Jr was born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, on August , . His father worked as a legal stenographer, but Persico idolised mobsters. As a kid, he was demanding his peers’ lunch money, as a teenager he formed the Garfield Boys gang. At , he was charged with killing a rival gang member, but the charge was dropped. By , he had been arrested for murder a second time.   He caught the eye of Frankie Abbatemarco, a member of the Profaci crime family – later to become the Colombo family – who hired him as an enforcer. He was in. But how to rise through the ranks  On October , , he was involved in one of the decade’s most famous mafia hits, the killing of crime boss Albert Anastasia, gunned down by the so-called “barbershop quartet” while getting a shave in the Park Sheraton hotel in Manhattan. No one was ever charged, but it’s believed Persico acted alongside one of the Gallo brothers, Crazy Joey. Later, when he learned kingpin Joe Profaci was creaming more cash than he should from his foot soldiers, Persico plotted with Gallo brothers, Joey, Albert and Larry, to take him out. Profaci caught wind of it, and bribed Persico to turn on the Gallos. On Profaci’s orders, Persico lured Larry Gallo to the Sahara Lounge in Brooklyn, and very nearly strangled him.   Luckily, for Gallo, a policeman walked in. Charges against Persico were dropped when Gallo refused to give evidence. The double-cross earned Persico his nickname The Snake, which he did not like. The Gallos tried to assassinate Persico, shooting him in the face. One of the bullets lodged in his mouth, but legend has it Persico spat it out and drove off. A few years later, he took revenge, killing Joe Gallo. When Profaci died of cancer, Joe Colombo replaced him, making Persico a “capo” in . Ten years later, Persico got to the top of the tree after Colombo was shot and paralysed. Michael Benson, who co-wrote The Snake’s biography with Dimatteo, says: “Carmine wanted to do just one thing with his le: be the leader of the gang, Top Cat. He acquired power the way other men breathe.”  Persico was in and out of jail throughout his tenure, but ran his operation from inside, making huge profits from loan sharking and racketeering. FBI wiretaps finally caught up with him and all five mafia families, resulting in the Mafia Commission Trial in the s. The Snake defended himself, and one judge said he was “one of the most intelligent people I have ever seen in my le”. He lost anyway and in  was put away for good for extorting millions. Seven others went down with him. An infection in his leg – for which he resisted amputation – and diabetes, ultimately led to Persico’s death at a federal jail in Butner, North Carolina. He leaves a we, two children, and  grandchildren. The Snake’s second nickname was “Immortal”, but, thankfully, it is only the legend that lives on.

In a statement issued earlier today, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus claimed the threat of pandemic influenza was “ever present”, warning the public not to underestimate the risks. He said: “We must be vigilant and prepared - the cost of a major influenza outbreak will far outweigh the price of prevention.” The last flu pandemic to strike was caused by the HN virus - also known as influenza A - that spread across the world during  and .   According to studies of that pandemic, at least one in five people worldwide were infected during the first year, and is estimated to have caused between , and , deaths globally in the same time. Global health experts and the WHO warn there is a risk that a more deadly flu virus will one day jump from animals to people, mutate and infect many hundreds of thousands of people. Flu viruses are multiple and ever-changing, and they infect around a billion people every year around the world in seasonal outbreaks.  Of those infections, around  to  million are severe cases, leading to between , and , seasonal flu-related respiratory deaths. Vaccines can help prevent some cases, and the WHO recommends annual vaccination - especially for people working in health care and for vulnerable people such as the old, the very young and people with underlying illness. The World Health Organisation’s plan - described as the most comprehensive to date - includes measures to protect the public as much as possible from annual outbreaks of seasonal flu as well as preparing for a pandemic. The plan’s two main goals are to to improve worldwide capacities for surveillance and response - by urging all governments to develop a national flu plan, and to develop better tools to prevent, detect, control and treat flu, such as more effective vaccines and antiviral drugs. During a pandemic, there is little or no pre-existing immunity towards the virus in the human population.  Three influenza pandemics occurred at intervals of several decades during the th century, the most severe of which was the so-called Spanish Flu”. It is believed to have caused an estimated – million deaths in –. Milder pandemics occurred subsequently in  and  known as the Asian Flu”, and the “Hong Kong Flu” in  - they caused an estimated one to four million deaths each.

Jaswinder Paul claims he bought a chunk of meat labelled lamb roast and was horried after discovering that it was actually beef. The barber didnt find out until after he had cooked it and eaten it - and he claims his family hasnt talked to him since. Mr Paul, from Blenheim, New Zealand, is now demanding the Countdown supermarket pay for a trip to his native India so he can be puried by priests after he broke his religious vow. Hindus consider the cow to be a sacred symbol of le. Mr Paul, who runs his own barber shop, told Stuff.co.nz: According to my religion, I have to go back to my country and do sacred things for four to six weeks, and be puried by priests, so I can continue on my religious path. Its a long process. Travelling to Delhi, he said, would require him to close his shop and pay thousands for flights, accommodation and food. Mr Paul said he complained to the supermarket and was offered a voucher as a goodwill gesture.   But he refused and asked the company to pay for his trip instead. That hasnt happened and he is not considering legal action as a last resort. He said: I understand this looks like a simple matter, but for me this is very hard. I break my religion [vows] because of someone s negligence. I know my society back from my home will not accept me with this breach of the religions conditions. It appears Mr Paul wont get his way. A spokeswoman for Countdown told Stuff.co.nz that an in-store labelling error resulted in a pack of beef mince being sold with both beef and lamb labels. She said the supermarket was sorry for the mistake and respects Mr Pauls beliefs, and that the goodwill gesture still stands.

The first-ever footage of the Filin P- in use was broadcast on the Russian Defense Ministry’s channel Zvezda. It was filmed as the defence technology was tested in St Petersburg and shows the light flashing on and off continuously. One of the Filin P-s was said to be on board the Russias missile frigate Admiral Gorshkov which was spotted off the UK coastline last week.The Royal Navy scrambled a warship, HMS Defender, to follow the Russian naval task group, including the missile frigate Admiral Gorshkov.  HMS Defender intercepted the Russian vessels in waters north east of Scotland and escorted them as they passed the UK coastline and sailed through the English Channel. The Admiral Gorshkov, which is on its maiden mission, is alleged to have been fitted with the Filin P- visual optical interference weapon which can blind enemies and cause nausea, leaving them with feelings of disorientation and hallucinations. It is said the non-lethal weapon fires strobe-like beams to disrupt the enemys vision and prevent an attack, and is part of an arsenal that includes guided Kalibr missiles. Russias Ministry of Defence said the Admiral Gorshkov - named after Soviet Navy Admiral Sergey Gorshkov - is sailing with the supply ship Elbrus, the rescue tug Nikolay Chiker and the tanker Kama.   The Admiral Gorshkov entered service last year and is expected to join Russias fleet of ships in the Mediterranean. HMS Defender, a Type  destroyer equipped with a Sea Viper missile system, was scrambled over the weekend to keep watch on the Admiral Gorshkov and three auxiliary ships. The British warship left Newcastle on Saturday to head northeast of Scotland to meet the Russian task group in time for the ships to pass the UK coastline on Tuesday. A Navy spokesman said: Portsmouth-based Defender is monitoring the Russian task group and keeping track of their activity in areas of national interest.   Armed forces minister Mark Lancaster said: The Royal Navy is always standing ready to defend the UK. We will continue to work with our allies to shadow Russian ships passing through international waters close to our shores, to ensure the Russian navy follows the correct protocol on its journey. The Filin P- has also been installed on Russias Admiral Kasatonov frigate.

It took  days for doctors to be satisfied that the twins were strong enough to be reunited, and the emotionally-charged moment was made all the more poignant when Zoe reached out to hug her older sister. The decision to deliver the girls early was made after doctors were concerned that one of them was in distress.Mum Ann Les pregnancy had been a high-risk one, with her precious girls sharing an amniotic sac.Known as monochorionic monoamniotc twins, this sort of multiple pregnancy means there is only  per cent chance the twins will survive past  weeks.   Throughout her pregnancy from  week mark, Ann, from Melbourne, Australia, had had to have fortnightly ultrasound scans to monitor the girls development.On the day of their delivery, Olivia came first - with a loud cry, Ann tells Daily Mail Australia .Zoe came next but was breech, so after a bit of pulling, the doctor managed to get her out. She didnt cry or move which made us really concerned.  Both girls were quickly taken by the midwives to the paediatric team for assessment. Fast forward a month and Ann was finally able to have a much anticipated twin cuddle. We waited  days exactly for our first twin cuddle and it was so much more than we could have expected, she adds. Olivia was placed on me first, then when it was Zoes turn she reached out her left arm and hugged her sister. My tears were flowing, its a moment Ill never forget. The proud mum shared the beautul moment on Instagram .Now Ann is hopeful that she can take her girls home with her by mid-April. It has been emotionally draining for my husband and I, but now that they have passed the one month mark, their chances of survival are now greater than  per cent, she said.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

He was a former member of shinty#s South of Scotland area executive council and did a lot of work for the Referees’ Association.He was probably best known for his work with young players in Mid Argyll, organising qualying tournaments of the Aviemore Indoor Sixes tournament for many years.

He also served on their committee for many years.John had served as a policeman for a short time before working in the quarry at Furnace, then going on to be a very well-known driver with Gleaner Oils, which supported many of his shinty activities with young players in Argyll.John was a great organiser and acted as goal judge in a number of senior shinty finals including the Glasgow Celtic Society Cup and notably the Camanachd Cup Final in Inverness when Gordon MacIntyre of Oban Camanachd scored his famous winner at the Bught Park.John apparently retrieved the ball from the net and lobbed another onto the park for the re-start before presenting the goal-scoring ball to Gordon after the match.John is survived by his brother Jim who played for Glasgow Police and he was pre-deceased by his we Donella.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob sheilds make new recycling","story":"NewsBob Shields: Make new recycling system in South Ayrshire work for usNew leaflets needed to inform the publicShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAfter a first glance at last week’s report on noisy bin men – I had to check out my calendar to make sure I wasn’t getting a month ahead of myself. Let’s face it, stories about a Mr Paine and some broken glass usually appear on April . But no – it really was only March ! Mr Paine’s issue is the emptying of his street’s bottle bins at am. On the morning of his first collection, he mistook the noise of breaking glass for a robber breaking into his house. “I was terried,” he said. And then added, “This is noise pollution and most of the street must have been up.” Well, I too have suffered Mr Paine’s ‘noise pollution’ - perhaps an even noisier version. Chez Shields is no stranger to a well chilled Petit Chablis washing down the foie gras before Eastenders. In fact, I’ve been known to pop a second cork just to recover from Eastenders! Based on Mr Paine’s video recording, the noise made by the emptying of my bottle bin is right up there - somewhere between a small public house and a decent sized restaurant. Andit wakes up my neighbours – I couldn’t give a Chateau Le Clos! On my street’s first collection, I didn’t wake up thinking I was being burgled. House-breakers don’t usually make enough noise to get “most of the street up”. I seem to remember thinking, “That’ll be the bin men . . .” and going back to sleep. And on the  days a year that the glass bins are emptied in “quiet, residential Masonhill”, I respectfully suggest Mr Paine does the same. After all, we’re talking about saving the world here . . . not saving an hour’s kip! Greenhouse gas emissions are asphyxiating the planet. Plastic bags are strangling dolphins and milk bottle caps are choking sea birds. Our little Earth is throttling itself. To be honest, I’d rather be concentrating on ten decades of industrial pollution than Mr Paine’s ten minutes of noise pollution. And meanwhile, still in bin land, South Ayrshire Council is blaming the public for the latest waste collection problems. I can see the point they’re making – but the word “contamination” is a bit strong for Mrs McGuffie putting Tiddle’s empty Whiskas can in the paper and cardboard bin. And the new recycling system is a little too new for the “red tag” bin police to be targeting offenders. By refusing to lt certain bins – South Ayrshire Council is tempting fate. I’ve heard reports of some people using a neighbour’s bin when their own bin is full and red tagged. I’m also told there are increasing incidences of household waste being stuffed in the street bins reserved for pedestrian litter. And stuck in the middle are the bin men themselves. One told me “If we red tag a bin – we get **** from the householder. If we take back a contaminated bin, we get **** from our supervisors. Basically, were in the **** no matter what we do!” My dear old mum used to use a lovely phrase – “There’s a place for everything . . . .and everything in its place”. That’s exactly how SAC’s new recycling system meant to work. But it’s going to take a little time and a little patience – on both sides. The info leaflets sent out to explain the new system were largely ignored or discarded - most people didn’t understand them. But with the new bins now rolled out – a back-up leaflet might help. “You’ve got your new bins – now here’s how to use them”. Rubbishing the new rubbish system isn’t going to make it go away. It’s here – let’s get on with making it work for ourselves, our neighbours and our community.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironment"},{"url":null,"title":"churches facing end era parish","story":"NewsChurches facing end of era as parish minister calls it a dayCrisis in Kirk conregationsShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email There’s no parish ministers round here, writes Edwin LawrenceThat’s the crisis facing Kirk congregations in Girvan and South Carrick. And it becomes reality with the imminent departure of Rev Richard Moffat from Girvan North Parish Church. The area – in the short term at least – will be dependent on the services of elderly retired ministers and lay readers. Mr Moffat has been a popular parish minister at Girvan North for five years. And he was due to become Moderator of the Presbytery of Ayr in April. But he is set to move to a new charge in Morayshire, to be closer to his daughter and her family. He will conduct his last Sunday service in Girvan North on March . Mr Moffat’s departure is the latest factor concentrating minds in the Church of Scotland. For Girvan South, linked with Barr and Dailly is currently without its minister. Popular Rev Ian McLachlan has been on sick leave for several months. And colleagues say he is unlikely toto full-time duties. Rev Stephen Ogston was parish minister at Ballantrae Colmonell from  until August, . But he moved on to Luce Valley Church, and no replacement has been found. The linked charge of Ballantrae St Colmon also takes in services at Barrhill and Glenapp. So communities right across Girvan and South Carrick no longer have a parish minister in their midst. And there is uncertaintly at how things will be resolved. One solution might be a union of the two Girvan churches. And that could leave Girvan North - with its -foot spire – as the last kirk in town. It would presumably also be used as a hub to minister to village churches. The Post understands there can be as few as six worshippers in Barr Parish Church on Sundays. This isn’t helped by Barr being last in the pecking order for services, after Girvan South and Dailly. So it’s virtually lunchtime before a Sunday service gets under way. A Presbytery of Ayr meeting was due in the Carrick Centre in Maybole on Tuesday this week.And the Post understands this will see Rev Ian Stirling Fisherton Kirkoswald appointed interim moderator at Girvan North. Locum minister will be retired minister Rev Edgar Ogston – father of Stephen – who livesin Girvan.The Post has spoken to kirk elders in Girvan who say they’re uncertain about the future. And a retired church minister suspects that the two Girvan churches will be required to amalgamate. He said: “Things are changing. We’ve been a clergy-centred church for  years. “But one positive thing we’re seeing is the rise of worship groups which are prompting people to think about their faith, without necessarily being preached at.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnChurch of ScotlandAyrMoffatGirvan"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"first minister must act over","story":"NewsFirst Minister must act over Tarbolton landfill, says MSPThe South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsBrian Whittle MSP challenges the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore than eight months after Tarbolton Landfill’s owners entered liquidation, MSP Brian Whittle has challenged the First Minister to act, writes Edwin Lawrence. The South of Scotland Tory MSP says he is hearing growing concerns from villagers about the condition of the site. He said: “Since the landfill closed its gates, worries have been expressed about smells and also about contaminated water running off the site.” These would normally be dealt with by the site owner, so Mr Whittle took up the issue with both the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand the Scottish Government. However, in the absence of a clear answer on ultimate responsibility, he decided to raise it at Holyrood, during First Minister’s questions. In response, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said:   “I am not able to give that information to Brian Whittle right now. “I undertake to raise the issue with the environment secretary and to come back to Brian Whittle as quickly as possible about our understanding of the lines of accountability and the action that the Scottish Government can take to try to reach a resolution of what certainly seems to be a deeply unsatisfactory situation. “I can understand that people in the local area will be very concerned about any prospect of contamination and it is absolutely necessary that all relevant agencies and organisations respond as quickly as possible.” Speaking afterwards, Brian Whittle MSP said: “The situation with the Tarbolton Landfill has been allowed to drag on for too long already. “Aside from the obvious concerns local residents have, it’s troubling that there doesn’t appear to be a clearly defined process for when the operator of a site like this is no longer able to carry out their duties to protect the surrounding environment. “I hope the First Minister will be able to provide some much needed clarity on this issue.” "},{"url":null,"title":"giant bins placed right outside","story":"NewsGiant bins placed right outside a restaurant and pub in scenic townAnger in Troon as bin squad set up town corral without asking anyone for permissionShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA council works gang put up a new big bin enclosure – right outside a restaurant and pub in the scenic centre of town. Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

Richard added: “I think it was possibly the highlight of Sooty’s career. It was just an amazing experience to be there at the London Palladium at the request of Prince Charles. “It turns out that Sooty and Sweep have always been personal favourites of the Prince. We also received a lovely personal letter saying how much he had enjoyed Sooty and Sweep’s performance.

close to where he first made his famous Coulters Candy - around August.And he will be joined by two additional bronzes - of a boy and girl - later in the year.The three-piece commemoration is being designed and made by Innerleithen sculptor Angela Hunter.Originally from Galashiels, Angela has worked alongside local historians Mary Craig and Graeme McIver, as well as local councillor Sandy Aitchison to champion Coltartrsquos story.Angela told us: ldquoI am delighted we now have an agreed design we are able to let the Borders public see.ldquoThe agreed design of the Robert Coltart sculpture is based on newspaper cuttings, including an image we have of him.\"While we can never be  percent certain of his appearance, the research by Mary and Graeme and feedback to our appeal means I feel I can now portray his stature and personality.ldquoI will now press ahead with producing a lasting legacy for Robert Coltart that Galashiels can be proud of.Robert Coltart was born in Dumfries and Galloway and moved to Galashiels at a young age, like many at the time, to work in the mills.It was during the s that it is thought the weaver began making aniseed-flavoured toffee at his Overhaugh Street home.As well as doing a fine trade at fairs, he would sell his candy around the streets of his adopted hometown by playing a whistle and singing his jingle - Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

Council is to close two of its waste recycling bin lorry depots as part of its new budget.The plans will see council bin lorries being moved from Peebles and Duns and consolidated in Hawick and Galashiels, leading to longer journey times for bin crews and some other staff travelling to work.The extra travelling times for bin crews operating in the north and east of the Borders could also lead to an increase in the waste disposal servicersquos carbon footprint.A council spokesperson said: ldquoA review of the waste collection service was considered by the council as part of its budget, and the decision was made to progress with operating the waste and recycling collection service out of two depots, Galashiels and Hawick, instead of the current four ndash Galashiels, Hawick, Duns and Eshiels, near Peebles.ldquoThese depots will not be closing as there are also community recycling centres at these sites.ldquoMoving to an operation out of two depots allows the delivery of a more efficient service, allowing the improved management, support and use of staff and fleet resources, and to address workload equality and inequality issues, deliver economy-of-scale efficiency savings, reduce need for and reliance on agency staff, enable more standardised operations and improve communications.ldquoAll changes are made and staff are supported in line with existing human resources

If we did not encourage change, we would still be living in caves.Mr Howardrsquos arguments have not swayed principal planning officer Carlos Clarke as he recommends that councillors reject the application and force him to cease trading from the premises.He writes: ldquoAspects of the development are acceptable, subject to conditions, particularly to rationalise the number and appearance of the ious small structures proposed.ldquoHowever, the joinerrsquos workshop and retail sales would be contrary to the local development plan, and this conflict is not overridden by other considerations.ldquoAs these elements form a signicant part of the development proposal, it would not be appropriate to delete them from a prospective consent by condition.ldquoUltimately, therefore, the application should be refused because of the proposed retail and joinerrsquos workshoprsquos conflicts with council planning policy.The proposed joinerrsquos workshop would be contrary to the local development plan in that there is inadequate justication for the proposed use on this site, which is not located within an allocated employment, mixed-use or redevelopment area, and would be potentially detrimental to the character and amenity of the surrounding area.ldquoThe proposed retail use would also be contrary to the local development plan in that the site is not within the town centre and it is not been demonstrated that there are no sequentially preferable sites closer to or within the town centre or that the proposed development would not detract from the vitality and viability of the town centre, and because the visual impact of the retail use proposed would be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area.ldquoOther material considerations do not outweigh this conflict."},{"url":null,"title":"readers-photo","story":"This photo, entitled lsquoRainy Days... rain drops and reflectionsrsquo was posted by BorderCamera Club member Hazel Dunbar.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"letter 1949 play about europe","story":"Courier readers may be as amused as I was to discover at the commemorative exhibition in Aqualibrium that the winner of the first Kintyre Drama Festival, back in , was Highland Church Drama Club.The club won with a play entitled #Sad about Europe#.

After his first two space launch attempts ended in failure, it is no surprise that Elon Musk#s SpaceX recently took a dummy to the International Space Station.Solo ocean crossings in a sailing boat are another example of a sport that seems too risky to many.Free Solo tells of Honnold#s perfectionism but ultimately he relies on  practice, friction, magnesium carbonate chalk for his sweaty palms and his wits.Throughout the ascent, and the preamble which leads to it, including romance and his girlfriend#s struggle #to understand#, Honnold is filmed by his friends, some of whom cannot bear to watch the final solo.Extreme solo feats have existed as long as humans. The marathon developed in Ancient Greece as a solo running challenge and people still die in the st century emulating those barefoot warriors.Climbing and mountaineering has a long history of solo risk taking and many of its protagonists live relatively short lives.Some though, such as legendary Italian Walter Bonatti, were hard wired for solitary ascents. He shot to fame in the s with a solo ascent of a climb on the Dru, renamed the Bonatti Pillar, in the French alps.Bonatti finished his hard climbing career in  with a solo in winter of the north face of the Matterhorn for the centenary of that mountain#s first attempt. He passed away, aged , in bed.Up till Free Solo, many films about climbing have only been of real interest to climbers and have not made it into mainstream cinema.Using the latest techniques including drones, remote cameras, huge telephoto lenses on digital cameras from the valley floor and cameras wielded by dangling climbers has created a National Geographic movie which has transfixed audiences.Even climbers emerge after an-hour-and-a-half with sweaty palms after the glimpse into Honnold#s seemingly nihilistic world.A still of Alex Honnold during his climb.

I didnrsquot want to be some airy fairy person, running around wanting to be a pop star.ldquoI was on my way to Loughborough University when I met a woman who had her own production company, who was looking for developing artists and I got talking to her.

We had walked away from college courses and university places to join a girl band, and what was our plan B  Was there ever a back-up  I honestly donrsquot think so. It was ludicrous. I think we were so in the moment, so caught up in what we wanted to do, that there was just no option other than it working.ldquoBut my mum always says to me,you wake up every day and it feels right and you are happy, then trust your instinct and do it. And maybe itrsquos because we were so headstrong and focussed that we didnrsquot give up.ldquoPeople try to put you in a box or dismiss you, but what we achieved proves thatyou work hard,you are authentic, then eventhe odds are against you it doesnrsquot mean you canrsquot succeed.The group split in .ldquoThe end of Mis-Teeq felt like the end of a marriage, says Dixon. ldquoIt was amicable, a joint decision, but there was still heartache and a lot of tears.ldquoThings had come to a natural end and we decided to go our separate ways. It was a walk into the unknown ndash and then, I had the dream scenario.Dixon was offered a lucrative deal with Polydor, and she spent  months writing and recording her solo debut album, Fired Up, alongside producers like Richard X, Brian Higgins, Estelle and Paul Epworth. But her joy evaporated when in November , Dixon was dropped by the label just as her one-year-old marriage to rapper MC Harvey collapsed, following revelations he had had an affair with singer Javine Hylton.ldquoIrsquod spent  months working on my solo album, putting all my eggs in one basket and they dropped me, says Dixon. ldquoI was left fumbling in the dark. I lost everything.She adds: ldquoWhen I finally stopped feeling sorry for myself, I realised I had to come up with a new plan. I made some calls, sent some emails.One of those calls was to Charlotte Oates, celebrity producer and talent scout for Strictly Come Dancing.ldquoA lot of people were a bit snobby about reality shows, but I loved Strictly and I told Charlotte Irsquod love to do itI could, she recalls.Dixon signed up for the fth series of Strictly in , partnered with professional dancer Matthew Cutler. She quickly became the favourite and beat actor Matt Di Angelo and Flavia Cacace in the final to win the glitterball trophy.ldquoIt was lovely, she sighs. ldquoIf I ever watch the dances back, it brings up so many emotions and Irsquom in floods of tears. It felt transformational, that show. I got a lot of love and support when I won Strictly and it made me feel, actually, that things were going to be okay after all. Strictly saved me.After a spell as a judge on the dance show, Dixon switched seats to Britainrsquos Got Talent, where she currently resides alongside Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and David Walliams. She has hosted many TV shows, including Alesharsquos Street Dance Stars on CBBC, Children in Need and ITVrsquos Dance, Dance, Dance.Her third book, Secret Supervillain vs Lightning Girl, will be published on March . It is the latest adventure of Aurora Beam, a little girl who discovers she is descended from a long line of superheroes.Dixon has written the books in collaboration with The It Girl author Katy Birchall.ldquoIrsquom really grateful to Katy and the team at Scholastic, they have really helped me bring all of my characters and ideas to le, she says.ldquoIrsquove always loved the idea of writing something. Irsquom not mad about doing an autobiography, but Irsquod thought something on wellness maybe, or a childrenrsquos book. The inspiration came from wanting my daughter to feel empowered. I wanted to create a positive role model, to say that itrsquos okay to be dferent, itrsquos okay to be me.Shaun Ryder: \"If it hadnt been for music I dont think I would be here.\"ldquoEvery single child deserves to feel included. I want readers to see themselves in Aurora, who is dealing with troubles at home and at school alongside finding she has new superpowers.As a child, Dixon read a lot but says no one character struck a chord with her.ldquoI liked Judy Blume, because she was a bit edgy, she says. ldquoWith Are You There God, Itrsquos Me Margaret, you always kind of felt you shouldnrsquot be reading it, and I loved that.ldquoBut there was no single character I really identied with ndash none that stayed with me, that I could see myself in.She adds: ldquoI donrsquot want my daughter to feel like that. I think things are changing, slowly ndash we live in a time where anything feels possible and it is great that underdogs, people who may have once just been pushed aside or overlooked, finally have a voice.ldquoBut only one per cent of British childrenrsquos books feature a main character who is black or minority ethnic, and statistics like that show there is still a long, long way to go.Finding space and time to write can be tricky, Dixon admits.ldquoDo I hide away for hours and write and write  God no, she laughs. ldquoWith Azura about, not a chance.ldquoI write on aeroplanes, or in the car, or at night in bed when Azura is asleep. Itrsquos the same with songwriting ndash I can never do it in the house, I have to go into the studio and physically put some distance between me and everyday le. I love writing, and I hope I always do it now. But finding a quiet place in my house to do it for hours on end  Never going to happen.Away from her multiple day jobs, Dixon lends her name and time to a range of good causes. She is currently working on a documentary about animals being used for entertainment.ldquoIf you are blessed with a , you should use it wisely, she says, adding emphatically: ldquoElephant rides, tiger selfies ndash itrsquos all just wrong. I feel very passionately about animal protection. My mother educated me. She showed me things that maybe people donrsquot like to look at, because they are afraid to. Irsquom the kind of person who looks, evenit hurts, because I believe knowledge is power. If you see it, you can do something about it.ldquoI canrsquot watch distressing videos, like the ones that come up on social media, and then just go about my day as usual.ldquoI have to act. AndI can do something that makes a few people look dferently at an issue, then job done. Irsquom quite a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of person.Itrsquos why, she thinks, audiences have warmed to her as a judge on shows like Britainrsquos Got Talent, where a string of hopefuls put themselves in the firing line in a bid to become famous.ldquoI never forget itrsquos a human being standing in front of me, she says. ldquoI always try to have a connection with that person ndash this is someone who is putting themselves out there, taking a step and we are all dferent and we all have our stories and experiences.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot forget that in the heat of making a television programme.ALESHArsquoS TRIUMPHSMIS-TEEQ: As part of Mis-Teeq, alongside Sabrina Washington and Su-Elise Nash, Alesha Dixon achieved two platinum albums and seven top ten hits, a Mobo award and a Brit nomination.SOLO CAREER: Alesha is the singer and author of nine top  singles and three platinum albums.

It was a family one for more than  years, but the ice cream war between brothers Aldo and Peter Nardini, feuding over the business and its direction, led to court cases, bitter accusations of treachery, plummeting fortunes and the shutters finally going up on the place, the familyrsquos heritage sadly melting away. Aldo Nardini died in , his brother Peter, the previous year. They had never properly reconciled.Only the name remained when Guiseppe lsquoSeprsquo Mirini and David Equi took the business out of receivership, revamped the interior and reopened after four years. Now they, too, have split, although itrsquos not about ldquoice cream dferences, it is stressed, but pursuing their separate businesses. Mirini owns the Tony Macaroni chain, Equi the eponymous Hamilton-based ice cream company.The two were joint owners of Nardinirsquos, but Mirini is now sole shareholder through his company Italgelat, although Equi remains a director. A spokesperson for Mirini stressed that the parting was perfectly amicable and that the two men remain good friends. Equi is in America and out of contact.Nardinirsquos has its roots in the Tuscan town of Barga, where so many emigrants to Scotland come from. In , Pietro Nardini arrived in Scotland with his family. After years of peddling round the country selling from a suitcase, he saved enough to open, in , the Largs cafeacute.It served food, too, but it was the ice cream created there from a secret family recipe which put the place on the map.Nardinirsquos heyday was in the s and early s when hordes of Glaswegians and others from further afield, in flat caps and best dresses, would go lsquodoon the watterrsquo, by train or ferry, to queue for a seat and taste the award-winning ice cream. What started as a humble cafeacute grew into a large space, an ice cream factory and a restaurant. Each weekend it would serve , gallons of ice cream, five tonnes of potatoes and  stone of haddock to holidaymakers.In the s, when cheap package holidays took off, the slide began. It was now being run by Pietrorsquos grandsons, Aldo and Peter, and they struggled to keep the business in the black.The two brothers could hardly have been more dferent. Aldo was tall, handsome and fit ndash the local paper dubbing him ldquothe Sean Connery of Largs ndash whereas Peter was shorter, a heavy smoker with a heart condition.In , they hired a non-family member, a friend of Peterrsquos, to turn round the ailing company, but it soon became clear that there were familial dferences over the appointment. David Hendry was a local businessman, who had built a fortune from a chain of funeral parlours and, to the brothers, at that time, he seemed to be the only hope to stop the family firm spiralling into bankruptcy.Three cousins, and fellow board members with the Nardini name, started legal moves to stop the appointment, but in what was the first of the internecine battles they failed and were quickly purged.The Hendry regime was initially successful and the business seemed to have turned the corner until the brothers fell out over future direction. The plan, resisted by Aldo, was to franchise the Nardini name to  cafeacutes and challenge new brands like Haumlagen-Dazs and Ben  Jerryrsquos, by selling Nardini ice cream through supermarkets.Aldo was implacably opposed. He said that while the firm wouldnrsquot make the profits of yesteryear ldquoit was still a good businessyou retained the family presence. The dference split the brothers. Peter owned  per cent of Nardinirsquos andAldo wasnrsquot coming with it, then he was going. In May  Aldo was removed from the board. He said that he was deeply shocked when his brother lted his hand to vote against him.Aldo set up his own business, Il Caffe Casa, but the family fallout took another corrosive turn which ended in the two brothers facing each other in court. Peter accused his brotherrsquos company of misleading customers into believing they were eating Nardinirsquos ice cream from Largs. The sherf ruled for Aldo but the ide was now unbridgeable.Aldorsquos daughter, the actress Daniela Nardini, stood by his side, fiercely and vocally loyal. She said: ldquoI would quite like to throw a stone through the window [of Nardinirsquos]hellipThe business has been taken over. It is just our name and our reputation.In , with debts of pound. million, Nardinirsquos went into receivership. Aldo revealed his sorrow.ldquoI am absolutely heartbroken. I said when David Hendry was brought into the company that running a funeral parlour was dferent to running an ice cream parlour. Sadly I am right. I have had no control over the company in recent years, as I had just a small share. The company is worth nothing ndash so I have lost nothing. But my children have lost what they should have inherited my grandfatherrsquos heart would break.The Nardinirsquos had lost control of their empire and only the name would survive . In , Marini and Equi formed a consortium to bring the cafeacute back and after four years, along with a pound.m refit of the listed building under the eye of Scottish Natural Heritage, Nardinirsquos reopened.The two partners opened another Nardinirsquos in Glasgowrsquos Byres road but a fortnight ago a lsquoto letrsquo sign was slapped on the window and a poster promising a refurbishment was removed. It had closed its doors just after Christmas, promising to reopen in the spring.The company had been embroiled in a planning dispute with the city council over change of use. A retrospective application for a cafeacute was rejected last year. The outlet had seemed to be popular, with queues out of the door in summer, but when it went down the blame was put on high rents.In recent years, the chain had also opened Nardinirsquos premises in Edinburgh and St Andrews as part of the firmrsquos expansion plans, but they have also since closed.This month a Nardini trading company in which Marini and Equi were directors , NOL Realisations ndash formerly Nardinirsquos of Largs ndash went into liquidation. According to liquidator Ian Wright there were no assets, only stock and cash. Lenders to the company ndash including the Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank ndash as principal creditors, are unlikely to receive much of the loans they made.Nardinirsquos of Largs in now a branch of the Tony Macaroni empire, Viva Italia. Sep Marini, now the sole owner of the business, promised ldquoitrsquos business as usual for the restaurant in Largs going forward.Business, for Nardinirsquos in the past, has been anything but usual. Who would risk predicting the next turn in the ice cream saga ITrsquoS a -minute sail from Largs to Cumbrae, a mile away across the Clyde, and from one of the window tables inside the cafeacute you can watch the CalMac ferry the Loch Shira come and go, while the waitresses, in black aprons, skirt or trousers and white shirts, ply you with coffee, scones or, of course, ice cream.When the actress Daniela Nardini was still a child she scooped ice cream for her dad Aldo in the cafeacute foyer. Although there was a major refit when Sep Mirini and David Equi took over, it remains true to the style of the old deacutecor, one that Daniela would recognise, although she probably hasnrsquot been inside since her father lost the business in the bitter dispute with his brother Peter. What has changed is the Italian restaurant specialising in pizzas, the Tony Macaroni addition, at a right angle to the frontage along Nelson Street.The cafeacute is still bustling,nothing like the fties, middle-aged women sit around sipping their morning coffee, in a space which can cater for , the light from the panoramic windows facing the water reflected off the mirrored glass over the bar area and onto the cutlery and the monogrammed cups and saucers. If you turn your head away from the quay view, a large, metal statue of a stocky Viking dominates, with his eyes focused on the inside of the cafeacute. It marks the Battle of Largs in , the last one between the kingdoms of Scotland and Norway.In , when Aldo was still at primary school, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, General Dwight Eisenhower, later to become US President, and Lord Mountbatten were spotted coming and going at the nearby Hollywood Hotel, which had been taken over by the military. They were holding secret meetings to plan the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Legend has it, whether true or not, that they ordered takeaway ice creams from Nardinirsquos.When Nardinirsquos opened in  a bandstand was included, with a six-piece orchestra playing from it and a male crooner moved around the tables serenading the girls. Then you could get a carry-out fish supper for sixpence, today yoursquoll have little change from a tenner. The cafeacute still serves the famous Knickerbocker Glory which, to day trippers in the early sixties, cost  D.

Less generous pension schemes have to stretch further as people are living for longer post-retirement.ldquoAuto-enrolment is welcome, but will not solve the basic problem of low levels of pension saving.ldquoWe would urge everyone to seek free, impartial and confidential advice from their local Citizens Advice Bureau, so they can make informed choices and plan effectively for their retirement.Mr Holmyard added that CAS is also becoming more aware of people dipping into their pension pots while working as a result of falling into debt.ldquoOur advisers are also increasingly hearing from people who are considering accessing their pension funds to solve debt problems, at the expense of their retirement income, which of course brings the risk of long-term financial problems, he said.Age Scotland argued that Scots should be offered a ldquocareer MOT at age  to allow them to ldquomake informed choices about training, pensions provision and future career options.Brian Sloan, chief executive of the charity, said: ldquoRight now more than half of older people age  and over have not retired because they arenrsquot ready to stop working.ldquoHowever, itrsquos worrying to hear that more than six out of  Scots donrsquot think their state pension will financially support them through retirement and that more than half do not have any plans to financially support themselves through retirement.ldquoTherersquos a clear need for more guidance to help people plan ahead for their working le and retirement.Mr Sloan added that the number of older workers is increasing faster in Scotland than the rest of the UK and called for employers to do more to support them.ldquoIt makes sense to invest in older workers, who bring a wealth of experience and skills and can provide valuable mentoring to younger generations, he said.The new full state pension is currently pound. per week, however the actual amount you get depends on your national insurance record.Under current UK Government plans, the state pension age will eventually extend to  for both men and women.However, the Censuswide survey showed that  per cent of Scots believe it will continue to increase beyond this.The data also revealed that more than a quarter of Scots do not have a private pension, with this breaking down into  per cent of men, compared to  per cent of women.Of those Scots who do have plans in place to support themselves financially in retirement, the majority plan to use savings to fund their lestyle, while others plan to sell their homes or other assets.Jordan Ferguson, of Censuswide Scotland, said: ldquoOur research indicates that Scots, of all ages, have growing number of concerns about their retirement.ldquoThe younger respondents polled seemed apprehensive that retirement age would continue to increase.ldquoWhile older respondents raised a number issues around financing their retirement."},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-independent-group-of-mps-have-become-completely-irrelevant","story":"John McDonnell branded the decision of eight of his partyrsquos MPs to leave and form The Independent Groupldquoabsolutely bizarre, and warned any support for them risked handing power to the Tories.It came as he announced a Labour Government would create , new jobs in Scotland as part of a ldquogreen industrial revolution which would see hundreds of wind turbines constructed north of the Border.Addressing a fringe meeting at the Scottish Labour conference in Dundee, Mr McDonnell said he was ldquodisappointed and to a certain extent perplexed that Labour MPs had left the party for TIG, which is made up of  pro-Remain MPs.:John McDonnell says Labour is preparing for GovernmentHe said one of the main reasons they gave was Labourrsquos failure to support a Peoplersquos Vote.

When he died in , John Buchan was given a state funeral and was revered as a novelist, scholar, politician, publisher, war correspondent and imperial proconsul, but, as with many other great Victorian figures, there has since been a reassessment. Was Buchan just a ldquoScotsman on the make out to use his connections to get on  Was he anti-Semitic  Was he racist  His granddaughter Ursula Buchan has set out to give her answers to those questions in a new biography Beyond The  Steps and, as the title suggests, she also wants to remind us there was more to John Buchan than his most famous book.One of the most surprising episodes in the new biography is Buchanrsquos experiences in the Gorbals as a child. If we think of Buchan, we probably think of him as a slightly grand Victorian figure, but his childhood was anything but. His father was a minister at the John Knox Free Church in the Gorbals and John went to school in the area, at Hutchesonrsquos on Crown Street, where he came to know the population and their problems. Many years later, he featured a gang of Gorbals schoolkids, the Diehards, in one of his novels, Huntingtower, and Ursula Buchan is convinced his time in Glasgowrsquos most notorious slum had a profound effect on him.ldquoIt had a huge influence, she says. ldquoThough Huntingtower, which is the first book where the Gorbals Diehards appear, doesnrsquot come out until the s, hersquos remembering his walking through the Gorbals to school every day.

He never forgot it and it was one of the reasons he could get on with anybody ndash he could walk with kings but never lost the common touch.The other extraordinary thing about Buchanrsquos time at Glasgow University, and then Oxford, was his capacity for work ndash something that never left him. He was studying for a classics degree, but he was also writing short stories, articles for The Glasgow Herald about what it was like to be a student, and a history of Brasenose College. A journalist at the time noticed Buchan and called him a ldquomiracle of precocity. Mind you, the journalist also said that there was no sign that he would ever do much in fiction.Read more: the men and women of Scotland who made a stand against warTo be fair, that was pretty much true until The  Steps was published in  when Buchan was . It was an immediate success and even now,  years on, you can see why: Hannay is hugely likeable, the prose is pacey, and Ursula Buchan believes the modern novel of espionage would not have developed along the same lines without it. Certainly, both Graham Greene and Ian Fleming acknowledged their debt to him.However, Ursula Buchan does get slightly frustrated that the story of her grandfather has become pretty much all about The  Steps. ldquoThatrsquos why I called my book Beyond the  Steps, she says. ldquoI knew I had to have it in there somewhere but he wrote that book in six weeks when he was ill to amuse himself because hersquod run out of thrillers. He never made any literary claims for it, but he realised he could make some money.Ursula Buchan believes her grandfatherrsquos real legacy lies in the fact that he lived a good and useful le and says she has tried her best to emulate it in her own work as a gardening journalist and writer. But just look at the list of what he did and you can see how hard that would be: he wrote more than  books, he was an MP, he was a publisher in Edinburgh, he was Governor General of Canada, he worked as a journalist during the First World War and wrote a -volume history of it. He also worked as an administrator in South Africa on improving the conditions in the concentration camps that had been set up by the British Army to accommodate Boer prisoners. The conditions at the time were a scandal and Buchan managed to get the death rate down by improving sanitation and water supplies.ldquoPeople donrsquot understand that the concentration camp in South Africa is not the same as an extermination camp in Germany, says Ursula Buchan, ldquobut they werenrsquot nice places and when the civil authorities took them away from Kitchener and the military, they were absolutely horried by the death toll. The army werenrsquot, I donrsquot think, actively cruel but itrsquos not what armies do ndash they donrsquot know how to look after civilian populations.ldquoBy the time John Buchan got there in October , there was already deep disquiet in Britain. That was what impelled them to turn it over to the civilian authorities and really try and do something. And they did. Within six months they had cut the death toll substantially and the protests in Britain died down.Ursula Buchan says her grandfatherrsquos approach to the camps was typical of his pragmatic views. ldquoHe was not a jingoist, she says, ldquoand he worried the Empire,clever energetic and public-spirited people didnrsquot continue to be involved with it, would decline to the detriment of everybody. In some ways, he was very much ahead of his time.Read more: The  Steps PlanIn other, more controversial ways of course, he was very much of his time and Ursula Buchan acknowledges this of her ancestor: his occasional use of the n-word, for example, or his use of language, mainly in The  Steps and the other Hannay books, that would now be considered anti-Semitic. His granddaughter points out that there are favourable depictions of Jews where in Buchanrsquos work he also supported the Balfour Declaration and in , less than three months after Hitler came to power, he was one of only  MPs who signed a motion deploring the treatment of Jews in Germany.ldquoThose were dferent days, says Ursula Buchan, ldquoand we have to be very careful about wagging a disapproving finger becausewe do that, we donrsquot allow ourselves to understand people in earlier times. We put a distance between them and us ndash lsquothey use the n word, theyrsquore deplorable, Irsquom not going to connect with these peoplersquo. Itrsquos very interesting that nobody criticised him at the time because everybody was using the same language ndash they generalised about peoples and races in a way that wersquore very much more reticent about.Ursula Buchan also has a warning for Scottish Nationalists who might seek to claim John Buchan as one of them, based mostly on his famous statement ldquoevery Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalist. In fact, Buchan was a ldquounionist nationalist who supported Scotlandrsquos place in the British union and Ursula Buchan is clear about where his loyalties lay. ldquoI donrsquot think he would have supported the modern Scottish Nationalist Party, she says firmly.As for Buchanrsquos Scottish background, his granddaughter says it is the key to understanding him and that the memory of his minister father with his poor, shabby congregation scattered round inner Glasgow influenced him hugely and drove him to push himself. Ursula also laughs about him being a hard act to follow. She never met her grandfather but having him as a relative, she says, meant writing was always considered a good and worthy thing to do.Ultimately, she would like to encourage people to read some of her grandfatherrsquos lesser-known works and find some of the gems embedded there. Such as this one about the fragility of civilisation: ldquoThere is a narrow line between the warm room and the savage out-of-doors hellip You call it miles of rampart I call the ision a line, a thread, a sheet of glass.And this one about his fears for the consequences of scientic development. Everybody in the future will be comfortable, he said, but easily distracted. ldquoTheir shallow minds would be easily bored, he said, ldquotherefore unstable. Their le would be largely a quest for amusement. In other words, John Buchan predicted the effects of the internet. It seems there was no end to his genius.Ursula Buchan is appearing at Aye Write at the Mitchell Library in Glasgow on March  at .pm. See ayewrite for more details.

We need to fund our NHS, our schools, our local authorities, build infrastructure and homes. We need to build the Scotland we want and we should not give that vision up.The Commissionrsquos six tests would assess whether Scotlandrsquos economic record was credible and sustainable whether markets had faith in a new Scottish Central Bank and its ability to issue debt whether the public and business wanted it whether Scotland had adequate reserves whether it would improve trade and whether Scotlandrsquos economic cycle was ldquosignicantly out of phase with that of the rest of the UK to make it ldquofeasible and desirable.Andrew Wilson, the former SNP MSP who authored the Commission, said explaining these tests to voters before a second referendum was an ldquoabsolute necessity.But Mr Kerevan said: ldquoThe views of international markets and corporations should always fall behind that of the people. The sovereign will of the Scottish people and Parliament should be the ones to make decisions on our currency to benefit our economy.ldquoIf certainty and stability is the aim, we should not leave the creation of independent currency to be open ended.

Thatrsquos why only Labour in Scotland is standing on an anti-austerity  offering hope and investment.TheScottish Socialist Party last week saidit would boycott any cross-party campaign in a second referendumthe Commission becomesSNP policy.Pamela Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, said:\"The SNPrsquos plan to ditch the pound and put mortgages, pensions and salaries at risk is reckless, and this splinter group now wants to impose the pain on the people of Scotland even earlier.\"The splits within the movement to leave the UK are growing because there is no coherent currency proposal for an independent Scotland, just like Alex Salmond found in . There is simply no better arrangement than the one we currently have as part of the UK.Tory MSPMurdo Fraser said:\"This simply demonstrates the splits that run through the SNP from top to bottom.ldquoThe Finance Secretary and the SNP deputy leader have already put forward a motion to create a new Scottish currency, but that clearly isnrsquot enough for these nationalists.ldquoNicola Sturgeon knows that there is no majority for independence, but she will not be able to appease her activists for much longer.ldquoWhile the SNP continues to argue over fictional currency, Scots want action on health, education and roads now.LibDem spokesperson Wendy Chamberlain said:\"In the midst of the Brexit chaos, as we face the very real danger of a no-deal exit, the SNP are focusing on their pursuit of another independence referendum.ldquoJust like Brexit, there isnrsquot a crumb of certainty about what you would actually get.ldquoThe SNP really have learned nothing from the past two years of constitutional turmoil. Breaking up is costly and hard to do.MrBrown said: \"I welcome any debate on the proposal that I and Derek Mackay and I have put forward. However, I believe it is essential that our proposal to move to a new Scottish currency has to take place at the best possible time for the people and economy of Scotland.ldquoIt is absolutely right that that decision is one for the first sovereign parliament of an independent Scotland to make, after all, the point of independence is to that decisions about Scotland can be taken in Scotland.

WonderBall, not to be confused with Wonderwall, Thunderball or whatever Head the Ball dreamed it into being, was hosted by Catriona Shearer, former Reporting Scotland anchor who fancies a walk on the lighter side of the broadcasting street.Ms Shearer introduced viewers to three teams of two, all standing. Between this, and The Ninersquos standy-uppy desk, someone at Pacic Quay has a downer on folk sitting down. The reason for keeping everyone on their pins soon became clear.First, Ms S explained the rules. There was a pot containing  coloured balls. If one team picked a ball belonging to another team and answered a question correctly, the ball was taken out of play. Last ball remaining would win the jackpot of pound. Simples, as PM Meerkat May would say. Except it was not. After ious additions to the rules in a doomed bid to liven up matters, WonderBall made -- look like two plus two.First week figures revealed With everyone standing behind a bench, how would the balls get to the players  Over to Ms Shearer. ldquoIrsquom going to wheech the pot down to you Bruce and Lindsey, she said, sending the receptacle on its way via a hidden rail cut into the desk. When Bruce and Linsey were done, they ldquowheeched the pot to the next contestants and so on. Genius. That is why they were all standing: as any wheecher knows, it is hard to get enough oomph in your wheech while sitting.Bruce and Linsey were lovely, as were Glasgow Yooni student pals Hannah and Asit, and Aberdeen father-daughter combo Kenny and Lesley. When anyone took another teamrsquos ball away they apologised. Not to be outdone, Ms S said she felt ldquohorrible for making the game harder half way through.Bruce and Linsey, saving for their wedding. Wee Hannah and Asit, poor students. Kenny, wanting to go on a family cruise with Lesley and the grandchildren. They were so nice I almost phoned up to pledge money. Evena team had won, they would have probably shared the jackpot with the losers, or given it to charity.Seriously, what is wrong with this country  Quiz shows today need ice in their hearts. Everything has to be all or nothing. Take Pointless, presided over by Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman, the Darth Vader and Voldemort of daytime TV. If the final answer is not pointless the Pointless jackpot stays in the pot.Magic or mince But what was this on WonderBall  Ms Shearer wandering around with fistfuls of twenties, tempting teams to ldquosell their balls. As a result, one losing pair walked away with pound. Anyone would think it was licence fee cash Ms Shearer was hosing around.With her sparkly top and laughing eyes, Ms S made Carol Smillie look torn-faced, though her one and only attempt at a catchphrase - ldquoAre we backing it or cashing it in  - rolled across the studio in true tumbleweed fashion.The market for quiz shows is becoming more crowded than that for cereals.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

We have been sharing information to help the sector prepare for that scenario.#However, Mr Carmichael is standing by his claims, saying behind the scenes analysis is a totally dferent level of depth than the full impact assessment expected to be done on such a massive change.He has branded conservative ministers #woefully irresponsible# for #failing to safeguard the sector from the impact of Brexit.#Speaking while making his claims, earlier in the week, prior to the response from DEFRA, Mr Carmichael said: #When Conservatives think of farmers, they think of the big landowners and the estates This [FOI] response shows that they have no interest in, or concern for, the hill farmers and crofters whose businesses are the backbone of so many of our remote rural communities.#To run their business, farmers need certainty. They need to know what funding is available, what standards must be met and what tarfs need to be paid.#It is therefore appalling that Conservative ministers have failed to conduct an impact assessment on the impact of Brexit on sheep farming. These ministers are woefully irresponsible. Farmers deserve better.#“Behind the scenes analysis falls well short of the in-depth impact assessment that farmers and crofters deserve. It is like not doing your homework, but trying to cover the fact by saying that you put together a mind map. Simply unacceptable. By the government’s own admission, they have done nothing, and know of no work to do an impact assessment on the industry.“They have let the industry, and our farming and crofting communities down.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She has now written to those involved to let them know the outcome.“My conclusion is that St Colm’s has a valuable role to play in the services we provide for people in our community with learning disabilities,” she said.“I believe that St Colm’s has a positive impact not only on the people who use the centre, but also on their parents and other family members. I can therefore confirm that St Colm’s will continue to be part of the services we provide for iniduals with learning disabilities for the foreseeable future.”She added: “I am very aware that this matter has been a source of upset and anxiety and I have apologised for this.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

FACT: Scotland has a mandate to pursue independence.” Ignoring the obvious hood that the SNP is not Scotland and cannot speak for it, it is important to establishthe Scottish people – whom the SNP says are sovereign – have authorised a second referendum in pursuit of independence. It will, after all, be upon the back of any such mandate that denial of the legal process of a Section  order from Westminster will be turned into the mother of all grievances.The chronology for the SNP claim starts six years ago when, in January , David Cameron promised a referendum on EU membershiphe were to command a majority following the  general election. As the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, the party published in June  a private member’s Bill to emphasise its intentions. It passed its first and second readings in the Commons but was stopped in the House of Lords.When the  Scottish independence referendum came along the following year, there could be no doubt in anyone’s mind that a referendum to leave the EU could take place and that it would be possible for the UK to vote to leave. Nor could there be any doubt that it would be an issue for the UK to decide as the member state – and so Scottish voters might take a dferent view from the rest of the UK electorate.Indeed, so likely was this scenario to become reality that during the independence referendum the Scottish Government warned Scottish voters that remaining in the UK could mean Scotland would leave the EU against their will. It was also clear during that referendum that, were Scots to choose independence, Scotland would leave the EU the same day that it left the UK – which was being suggested by the SNP would take place before the next general election. By the SNP’s own words, it is beyond challenge that the “circumstances” of the  referendum were that the SNP was willing to take Scotland out of the EU as a price for achieving independence, and that, were Scotland to remain in the UK, it might still leave the EU later, irrespective of how Scots voted. Scots voted to stay with the UK.Once the Conservatives’  general election victory arrived, it was announced that the promised referendum would take place in June  and would be a UK-wide decision.Nicola Sturgeon, by then First Minister, had the opportunity to put at the centre of her May  Holyrood election campaign a promise to hold a second independence referendum. Instead she relegated the idea as a priority, burying it on page  with the caveat there would need to be “a signicant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in , such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will”.The Scottish public was by then getting fed-up with Sturgeon’s fixation with holding a second referendum and in May  she lost the SNP’s overall majority. The unionist parties won . per cent of the constituency vote. Together this meanteven her caveat was rejected – she had no moral or legal claim and no public mandate to hold a referendum.The next month the UK voted to leave the EU, but a majority of Scots preferred that the UK should stay. This has been claimed ever since as a “material change” of circumstances that justies the SNP Government demanding the authority to call a second independence referendum. Only it is no such thing.As I have explained above, the possibility of the UK leaving the EU with the majority of Scots opposed was already well known and foreseen the fact that it materialised was not therefore a change – the circumstance had always been there. Furthermore, the SNP had advocated the very same outcome as the price of Scottish independence two years before . The following June, we then had the  general election, by which time Sturgeon had gone on, and on, and on about a second referendum. The result was her party lost . per cent of votes and  MPs. There could be no doubt that with some . per cent of votes going to unionist parties the Scottish public was in no mood for another referendum – be it about Scotland in the UK or the UK in the EU. It is said there is a mandate because the Scottish Parliament passed a motion in favour of being able to hold a referendum, but MSPs voting for their own policies does not make it a mandate from the Scottish people.There is a way round the claims and counter-claims about the existence of a mandate for a second independence referendum. All Sturgeon has to do is go to the country. She can call time on her minority administration and hold fresh parliamentary elections to show once and for all that the Scottish people will not put up with being “dragged” out of the EU. Every party will need to state, for the avoidance of doubt,they will subsequently vote in Holyrood to call a referendum.If Sturgeon is then able to form a new administration, with or without the support of the Greens, she will have an unimpeachable claim that a Section  order to hold a legal referendum should be granted. Westminster would find it dficult to deny one in such circumstances. If Sturgeon is defeated then a new administration could be formed – but without the prospect of a referendum dominating every issue to the detriment of Scotland’s governance.So, what’s it to be, First Minister  Will you put your faith in your fellow Scots to back you ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit theresa may heads for last ditch talks in strasbourg","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa May has set off to Strasbourg for last-minute Brexit talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on the eve of a crucial vote in the House of Commons.The last-ditch bid to make progress in talks, which Downing Street admitted overnight were \"deadlocked\", comes amid predictions that the Prime Minister is headed for a second humiliating defeat on her Withdrawal Agreement unless she can secure legally-binding changes to its controversial backstop.Sources in London played down suggestions that Mrs Mays departure for France was an indication that a deal is ready for signature.Mrs May is likely to arrive in Strasbourg in mid-evening, and a statement to the Commons by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has been put back to around pm.: Downing Street says Brexit vote will go ahead despite uncertaintyThe Government must table its motion for Tuesdays debate by the end of the day, alongside the publication of any relevant documents - including Attorney General Geoffrey Coxs legal advice on the deal.Earlier, the Irish Deputy Prime Minister had revealed the Prime Minister would be going to Strasbourg.At press conference in Dublin, Simon Coveney said: “I don’t think it is helpful to go into the detail of what the obstacles are to getting agreement but there are some.“But our approach remains the same, consistent.

However, we must not be complacent and allow for Scotland’s revenues to be used to cover the costs of Tory tax cuts for rich.“A portion of oil revenues should be invested in a fund for future generations, as most other oil-producing countries have done – something which will ensure there is a positive economic and social legacy from our oil wealth.“Of course with a host of industries booming across Scotland, like our food and tourism sectors, Scotland is a hugely wealthy country even without oil and gas. But the only way to ensure that Scotland’s valuable natural resources are invested here in Scotland, and not squandered by Westminster, is through independence.”However Colin Clark, Scottish Conservative MP for Gordon, said the SNP had “learned nothing from recent history”.“Whenever there is a boost in production, we are all expected to believe independence is nigh. Yet when there is a downturn, it is the UK Government that must absorb the drop in revenue. - Tribunal rules that councillor’s views on Scottish independence are ‘philosophical belief’“The Scottish people rejected independence when oil was  a barrel – they are unlikely to change that view at .“The fact is that the policies of this Conservative government have kept taxes stable and encouraged investment in the North Sea.

Almost , jobs were lost due to the collapse in oil prices since  and the response from both governments was nowhere near good enough.“Instead of going back to the fantasies of the referendum campaign, the SNP should focus on supporting the jobs and prospects we actually have in this vital sector of the economy.”While UK oil production rose last year, gas production fell by three per cent.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"new recycling centre to create 50 new jobs","story":"Fty new jobs are being created in a new recycling centre in Ballymena by a leading social enterprise that finds work for people with disabilities and long term health conditions.Ulster Supported Employment Ltdhas opened new , sq. ft premises in Ballymena as part of its continuing growth in recycling, creating environmentally friendly products and sustainable employment.The new venture will expand the company’s recycling capacity by  per cent, increasing from , tonnes of material each year to  tonnes.

He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat.

This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

In doing so she also spearheaded the attack from her team and led them to the Ulster Inter Girls’ team title in the process. A first Ulster team title at any level for Banbridge Academy. Her teammates were equally determined and with Nadia Radclfe placing th, Ruby McNf st and Lucy Bradshaw th they ran out comfortable winners by some  points from their nearest challengers. A truly awesome effort from a very talented and committed group of girls.Pictured at the Ulster Schools Cross Country Championships is champion Bethany Nixon from Banbridge Academy.Bethany set the tone when she ran hard from the start at the Mallusk Playing fields venue and took the race by the scruff of the neck. Over the course of the race she kept up the pressure, and the pace, and left everyone trailing in her wake. Despite a late attempt at a comeback by her nearest rival, Bethany responded with a kick at the end and won the race by some  metres. A truly outstanding race from a dedicated and hard-working young girl. It was made all the more special as older sister Rebekah, who won the Senior Ulster title last year, was spectating and was on hand for a celebratory hug at the end. When Nadia, Ruby and Lucy followed in high places there was jubilationwhen the girls realised they had achieved their own bit of history by being the first Banbridge Academy team to claim a Gold in the long history of the championships. All four girls will now travel to Clongowes Wood College near Dublin on Saturday, March  for the Irish Championships and they have every reason to believe they have a medal shot therethey emulate the fantastic runs they all achieved in the Ulster Finals.In the boys races, the Academy had two other athletes who also qualied for the Irish championships with brilliant runs of their own. In the Junior Boys’ race Simon Ferris ran strongly to finish th in a huge field and in the Minor Boys’ Matthew Stevenson fought off many challengers to finish th and claim his spot.

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

The school, which is still teaching children and young people the precise skill and technique of Irish dancing, was founded by Moya Connnolly who told the Andersonstown News that this year’s reunion is very much “a celebration of the school and friendships that were formed”.“Initially we had pupils from the circle of streets in the Andersonstown area,  pupils at the beginning, and we taught from the ages of four up to ,” she said.“The classes just grew and grew and spread down to Clonard.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time. Confidence in the building of a truly human rights-compliant system of law, order and justice relies on the rule of law winning against politically motivated vested interests. Some will try to portray these developments as uneven or unbalanced. Quite the reverse is true."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"two more people to stand trial linked to meli case","story":"TWO more people are to stand trial on offences arising out of the murder of Christopher Meli.-year-old Daniel McManus, of Springbank Drive, and Shannon McIIwaine , of Glenalina Park, both in West Belfast, appeared at Belfast Crown Court on Friday for a ruling on their case.Mr Justice Colton dismissed applications by their legal teams to have charges of affray dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence.The senior judge said that although they were not accused of engaging in violence on the night of Mr Meli’s murder in December , he had come to the conclusion, “that their conduct taken at its height is sufficient to put each of the defendants on trial for affray.”Dismissing the application, Mr Justice Colton added: “I am satisfied that the affray took place in a public place and in such a manner that a bystander or reasonably firm character might reasonably expect it to be terrying.” Following his ruling, both defendants were formally arraigned on a single count that they “unlawfully displayed force and made affray” on December, , .Both replied “not guilty” and were released on continuing bail ahead of the start of their trial on September .In January this year, six other people were ed for trial in connection with Mr Meli’s murder.Three are charged with murdering the -year-old father-of-one, while their co-accused face other charges linked to alleged incidents on the evening.Mr Meli was beaten to death at Doc’s Path in the Glasvey Close area of Twinbrook.At the time police, believed up to  young people were involved in a number of violent incidents that culminated in his death.All six accused appeared at Belfast Crown Court where they heard the trial could last up to  weeks.The trio accused of murdering Mr Meli are Caolan Lavertyof Belfast Road in Glenavy, Stephen McCannof Dundrinne Road in Castlewellan and -year-old Lee Smyth, who was living at an undisclosed address in County Antrim.

With a decision due on prosecutions later this week, Lord Ramsbothan, who was military assistant to the British Army’s Chief of General Staff at the time of the massacre said putting ex-soldiers on trial \"would set a dangerous precedent.\"Mr McCartney said: “These comments are yet another attempt by figures within the British establishment to influence the due process of law, specically in relation to Bloody Sunday prosecutions and more generally in relation to the wider legacy process.“We have heard similar outbursts from the British Secretary of State Karen Bradley and her Prime Minister Theresa May who repeatedly and ly claim that legacy investigations are unfairly weighted against State forces.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"The British Government’s intent is about protecting British soldiers who were responsible for killing Irish citizens and who colluded with loyalist death squads throughout the conflict.“That is completely unacceptable. There can be no immunity of impunity for British soldiers guilty of crimes in Ireland.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay accompanied the PM to the talks.A Government statement is set to be made to the Commons later on Monday night.Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliment’s Brexit co-ordinator, confirmed he and EP president Antonio Tajani will also meet Mrs May on Monday night.In other diplomatic moves, an emergency meeting of Irish cabinet ministers was called for Monday night.Irish premier Leo Varadkar, who was due to begin a journey to America for St Patrick’s Day, ed from Dublin airport for the cabinet briefing.Time is running out for any new assurances or clarications to the deal which was resoundingly rejected by a -vote majority by MPs in January.The Government must table its motion for Tuesday’s debate by the end of the day, alongside the publication of any relevant documents.MPs have also been promised that they will be shown any updated legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox before the debate begins.Mrs May’s efforts to secure new assurances appeared to have hit stalemate on Monday morning, as Mr Barnier said discussions were now taking place “between the Government in London and the Parliament in London”, rather than the UK and Brussels.RHI: Government pulls vote after Lord Empey makes last-ditch bid to delay huge subsidy cuts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But Downing Street insisted that “talks continue”, after Mrs May held a phone call with Mr Juncker in early afternoon.Reports suggested that EU ambassadors were told the PM came close to signing off a text with Mr Juncker on Sunday evening, which would have given new assurances on the UK’s right to seek arbitrationBrussels was not using its “best endeavours” to seek a trade deal which would bring the backstop to an end.Number  dismissed reports that Mrs May might pull Tuesday’s meaningful vote, insisting it would go ahead as planned.The PM’s spokesman cautioned against “speculation” that Mrs May might ask Parliament to vote on a “conditional” motion expressing its readiness to support a form of deal other than the one agreed with Brussels.Mrs May ducked a demand from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to update the House of Commons on the progress of negotiations, sending Brexit minister Robin Walker to respond to his urgent question in her place.Mr Walker was jeered by Labour MPs as he explained he had been sent because negotiations were “at a critical stage”. The absence of the PM was branded “an outrageous dereliction of duty” by backbencher Angela Eagle.As MPs debated Brexit, Mrs May was on the other side of Parliament Square at Westminster Abbey taking part in a Commonwealth Day service.She read a Bible lesson on the importance of solidarity, stating: “The body is not one member, but many ... And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.”Mr Corbyn told MPs that “the Government is in chaos and the country in crisis”.If her deal is rejected again on Tuesday, the Labour leader said the PM should “sht her red lines and show not just that she is willing to meet with members of this House, but that she is willing to compromise with them too”.Mr Walker confirmed the meaningful vote will take place on Tuesday, and said it was “incumbent” on MPs to take the opportunity to “deliver on the will of the British people and to provide certainty” by backing Mrs May’s deal.The Prime Minister was warned that her position could be in jeopardy unless she stuck to commitments she made about this week’s votes.If her deal is defeated for a second time on Tuesday, she has promised to give MPs a vote on whether to accept a no-deal Brexit on March  or to extend Article  in order to delay the UK’s departure beyond the current deadline.Tory former minister Nick Boles said: “I am sure that the Prime Minister will honour these three commitments. If she doesn’t she will forfeit the confidence of the House of Commons.”Senior Labour backbencher Yvette Cooper said the PM would be guilty of a “straight-up lie”she failed to go through with votes allowing MPs to delay Brexit.Brexit-backing Conservative MP Anne Marie Morris said she did not expect any concessions secured by the Prime Minister in Strasbourg to alter her intention to vote against the Withdrawal Agreement on Tuesday.The Newton Abbot MP told BBC Radio ’s PM: “The reality is we’ve taken almost two years to get here and I cannot see that in these twilight hours, suddenly something is going to come back and is going to satisfy concerns that I have - which I share with, I’m sure, many members of the public and many members of the ERG .“This deal is a bad deal and what we need is for the Prime Minister to stick to her word that she would accept that no deal is better than this deal.”Remain-backing Tory MP Sam Gyimah said he could not vote for the PM’s deal.“If there hadn’t been a referendum and this deal had been presented to us as a template for our future relationship with the EU, it would have been rejected out of hand because we are essentially choosing a third-rate future for our country,” he told PM. “That is why I can’t vote for it.”Ed Vaizey, who backed Mrs May’s deal in the first meaningful vote, said: “I am going to vote for the deal. I find it intensely depressing to think that yet again it seems likely that the deal is going to be voted down.”Mr Vaizey saidMrs May’s plan was rejected “all bets are off - it will engender complete parliamentary chaos”.Although MPs would then be right to vote for an extension to Article , “all Hell will break loose”, he said.try catch  TrendingRoad reopens after collisionStorm Gareth worse than originally thought -

Social media was abuzz this morning as pictures emerged of travellers standing in security lines stretching outside the terminal building.It comes after the airport last month said it was expanding its security area from six to eight search lanes to improve wait times at security.However, in order to facilitate the expansion work, the airport has temporarily reduced the number of lanes to five.Some passengers caught up in the delays took to Twitter to vent their frustration.Paul Fitzpatrick tweeted: “Was here in plenty of time but not even in the airport yet. How will I make my . flight ”Mr Fitzpatrick ended up missing his plane to Edinburgh after queuing in security for over an hour, and had to transfer to another flight at George Best Belfast City Airport.He told the News Letter he would never use Belfast international Airport again, describing the situation as “farcical”.The airport’s managing director Graham Keddie revealed that around  passengers had missed their flights as a result of the security delays.Speaking on Radio Ulster this morning, Mr Keddie apologised to those affected by the situation, but asked passengers to be patient as the airport implements its improvements.He added that the airport currently has % less queueing space in the search area due to the ongoing constructions work.“We dropped the number of lanes to five to facilitate our construction work about  days ago and phase one of this is due to complete by Thursday night when we go back to six lanes. Phase two is due to complete before Easter,” he added.He acknowledged that the reputational damage to the airport was signicant, but added: “We will get it right and by Easter we will be on eight lanes fully manned.Security alert: Suspicious object was ‘nothing untoward’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“It is embarrassing and humiliating for us as a team.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The condition can go undetected for years, and by the time of diagnosis one in three people already have complications with their eyes, feet, kidneys or nerves.With , people in Wales at risk of developing Type  diabetes, Diabetes UK Cymru wants to raise awareness of the risk factors so people can take steps to look after their health and prevent or delay the onset of the condition and serious complications.Dai Williams, national director, Diabetes UK Cymru, said: ldquoDiabetes is Walesrsquo biggest and fastest-growing health crisis.It costs the NHS in Wales over a pound billion a year, the majority of which is spent on treating largely preventable complications.ldquoWe urge everyone to find out their risk of developing Type  diabetes with the Know your Risk tool.To find out your risk of developing Type  diabetes, go to https:www.diabetes.org.uk riskscore article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20190201_0983.jpg","title":"pwc investing in people purpose and belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business Almost  years after it moved  staff and , paper files into Waterfront Plaza, PwC will move again – this time taking around , people and some very smart technology to Merchant Square in the heart of Belfast Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business locally.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC. Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.
