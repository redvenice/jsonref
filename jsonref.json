Supermodel Kate Moss, a friend of Sir Philip Green, was pictured cracking a smile out in London today but has yet to say anything about the bullying accusations against the businessman\u0027The problem is there is no way to force him to do it as it\u0027s a private company.

He doesn\u0027t contact us. John was quite delicate all along.\u0027Indeed his lifestyle in South London is so reclusive and quiet — and his attitude to fame so hostile — that the band apparently don\u0027t expect him to respond when they contact him.His wife sometimes tells callers to their home that he \u0027doesn\u0027t live here\u0027, or that she \u0027doesn\u0027t know where he is\u0027.Neighbours say that they are aware that he lives next door, but they barely see him from one year to the next. The only exception was the local pub, where he used to call in three times a week for a glass of white wine with his wife — but it has now become a supermarket.So why is he so reclusive?          This week, just a few miles away, his former friends Brian May (left) and Roger Taylor (right) strolled up the purple carpet at the premiere of the film Bohemian Rhapsody (Rami Malek, centre, who plays the role of Freddie Mercury)Drummer Taylor describes him as a \u0027sociopath\u0027, while May suggests that Deacon has never recovered since a booze and drug-soaked period which he implies led to a breakdown more than 35 years ago.Extraordinarily, Taylor says they haven\u0027t spoken in more than a decade. \u0027I haven\u0027t heard a squeak from John, not a single guttural grunt,\u0027 he adds. \u0027We\u0027re not in touch but John\u0027s a sociopath, really, and he\u0027s given his blessing to whatever Brian and I might do with the brand — and we\u0027ve done rather a lot.\u0027May says he contacts Deacon often to ask permission for various commercial enterprises to do with Queen (Deacon remains a quarter shareholder in Queen Productions Limited) but it\u0027s not clear how much of a response he gets.The company is blue-chip to say the least — turnover was recorded at £18.5 million in 2017, with that figure set to swell thanks to the new film.Not that you would suspect such riches from his unassuming home in Putney, which he bought with his first royalty cheque.He\u0027s never moved, because he didn\u0027t want to disrupt the schooling of his six children. This quiet living is the exact opposite of the showy excesses of Queen.          John Deacon, left, Freddie Mercury, centre, and Brian May, right, pictured in 1979The band were famous for always demanding the best, for spending more than anyone else on private jets, stretch limos, fleets of assistants, hairdressers, designer stage costumes and the rest.There were four-course backstage feasts with candelabras, orgiastic parties involving dwarves and bowls of cocaine and appearances by performance artists, like the man who lay naked under a pile of chopped liver and was ordered to make the meat twitch when people walked past.The band was formed in 1970, originating from a band called Smile which included May, then a student at Imperial College.A fan of the band was Farrokh Bulsara, a student at Ealing College, who joined as the vocalist and changed his name to Freddie Mercury.They had a number of bass players before settling on Deacon. Legend has it that he was the seventh one they auditioned.          Queen were, of course, shattered by Freddie Mercury\u0027s death in 1991, but since then, May (right) and Roger Taylor (centre left) have continued to record, tour and perform, both as solo artists and as Queen\u0027We were so over-the-top, we thought that because he was quiet, he would fit in with us without too much upheaval,\u0027 recalled Taylor. May agreed: \u0027He\u0027s very solid and no-nonsense. He\u0027s always got his feet firmly on the ground.\u0027Deacon grew up in Leicestershire, the eldest child of an insurance broker, Arthur, who died when John was 11.He had been encouraged by his father to take up music, and formed his own band at 14. Deacon was, like May, a technological pioneer.He has a first-class degree in electronics from Chelsea College, and used to build equipment for the band, his most famous creation being the \u0027Deacy Amp\u0027 amplifier.Worldwide fame came in the mid 70s, with Bohemian Rhapsody. Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make.Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour.\u0027John is one of those guys who will say nothing and then he will crack a joke, something really near the knuckle, and you will think: \u0027Did I really hear that right?\u0027 says Jacky Smith, who runs the Queen International fan club. He and Freddie were particularly friendly and would hang out together between gigs.Manager Chris O\u0027Donnell says: \u0027Brian May and Roger Taylor, who were the real rockers in the band, would slip away to hang out at some club in town leaving Freddie and John behind. John gradually started leaving too, and Freddie would go off to prowl the gay clubs.\u0027           Deacon was known to hang back on stage, and those who remember him from this time say he seemed cripplingly shy — although with a dry sense of humour. Left to right: John Deacon, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor and Brian MayPhil Sutcliffe, author of Queen: The Ultimate Illustrated History of the Crown Kings of Rock, said: \u0027John Deacon was very much the silent bass player which is why these days he can go around practically incognito, which is just the way he likes it.\u0027He was always ambivalent about the attention.\u0027Queen was a very volatile partnership between three explosive personalities, and then you had John, who was the still point. He had his family early on, from 1975, and was very much a family man.\u0027Deacon married Veronica Tetzlaff, a pretty blonde Polish Catholic trainee teacher, in January 1975 when she was pregnant with their first son, Robert, and Queen were just tasting global fame. They went on to have four more sons and a daughter. May said in an interview last year that the band  out of control while recording in Munich in the early 1980s. In a book he said that the band were: \u0027Living in a fantasy world of vodka and barmaids.\u0027He added: \u0027We all lost our minds . . . we were all in a perilous place where our emotions were out of control.\u0027It manifested itself in way too much drinking, a certain amount of drugs, which I didn\u0027t share — but certainly an awful lot of vodka went through my body. We all fell to bits.          Their touring was legendary and their studio albums were complex and expensive to make\u0027We overreacted with each other at times. We all left the band at some point. The studio\u0027s a hard place for a band anyway, but in our case all four of us as writers had had worldwide hits. The lifestyle we led magnified that conflict.\u0027May said it ended with \u0027John disappearing to Bali and seeing God or whatever\u0027. He added: \u0027He could be very outgoing and very funny, but I think some of the stuff that happened in Munich gave him a lot of damage, and I think losing Freddie was very hard for him as well. He found that incredibly hard to process, to the point where actually playing with us made it more difficult.\u0027In a rare interview, Deacon said he found the band\u0027s hiatus in 1985 hard to cope with. \u0027I went spare, really, because we were doing so little. I got really bored and quite depressed.\u0027Queen reformed the following year and continued to dominate the charts, playing sell-out stadium tours for the next two years.In July 1986 they threw a famous party at the Roof Gardens in Kensington to celebrate a gig at Wembley. The serving staff were entirely naked apart from body paint.Mercury, tortured by his promiscuous homosexuality, arrived with former girlfriend Mary Austin — his lover Jim Hutton nowhere to be seen. Deacon was overcome by booze. Fan club boss Jacky, who was on the same table, says: \u0027At one point late into the night John just slipped quietly off his chair, and ended up underneath the table. After a while he came back again. That was very John, he liked a drink.\u0027But Mercury\u0027s failing health began to cast a shadow. In 1987, not long after that party, Mercury was diagnosed HIV positive. As his health failed, the band made one final album. Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon.Robert Ahwai, a friend of Deacon\u0027s from college, recalls: \u0027Maybe he thought, \u0027Freddie was the band, so what\u0027s the point?\u0027          Mercury died in November 1991, and the band members were devastated — none more so than Deacon\u0027He suffered from depression after Freddie died and I am not sure he has ever come out of it.\u0027Deacon played with May and Taylor at the Freddie Mercury Tribute concert in April 1992 and again, in January 1997, to showcase the final Queen song No-one But You (Only The Good Die Young) — a tribute to Mercury. Since then, he\u0027s barely been seen in public.When the musical We Will Rock You opened, May admitted that Deacon had not been to see it — although I\u0027m told he has been spotted in the audience.Queen author Sutcliffe says: \u0027After Freddie died, John withdrew more and more. I think Brian May once said that they tell John everything they are doing, and take his silence as acquiescence. He is an enigma.\u0027Jacky Smith agrees. \u0027John just gave up after Freddie died. He and Freddie were opposites really, because John is so shy and he was the youngest in the band. Freddie took him under his wing and they were very close for all those years.\u0027Freddie drew the attention away, and without Freddie there, I don\u0027t think John could face any of it.\u0027There was a short-lived scandal when it emerged in 2002 that Deacon had been visiting a strip bar and formed a friendship with lap dancer Emma Shelley, with whom he was photographed in central London.Those who know John say the episode seems out of character, and are dubious about how far these proclivities went.One neighbour said this week: \u0027You are wasting your time if you are trying to find John. He does live there, but he doesn\u0027t talk, not to anyone.\u0027I haven\u0027t seen him in a long time, he is fine, just private. The last time I saw him was a few months ago, in the summer.\u0027In an interview with a fansite some years ago, Deacon said his hobbies were drinking tea and having children.These days John Deacon\u0027s great passion is said to be golf — hardly the soul of rock \u0027n\u0027 roll. A desire for anonymity seems to be a recurring theme.The barman who used to serve him at his local pub revealed that he\u0027d been warned by Deacon\u0027s wife Veronica who the musician was — and was told not to mention Queen.So what next? Maybe John Deacon will go to see the new film, in which he is played by American actor Joseph Mazzello.But if he does, you can bet he will do his best to slip into the local cinema as just another anonymous face in the crowd."},{"url":null,"title":"Dont forget clocks TONIGHT British Summer Time finally comes end 2am","story":"At 2am last night (Sunday October 29) the time in the UK will go back to being 1am as Greenwich Mean Time replaces British Summer Time This is because Britain has come to end of British Summer Time, also called BST.By moving our clocks forward in the summer every year, in a tradition marked with the Summer Time Act 1916,  farmers and workers are given another hour of daylight to work, and output would be increased.Originally, this was to contribute towards the war effort, since there was more light in the evenings. It had been discussed for a number of years beforehand by the Government but many people opposed it the first time around.A man called William Willett wrote a whole pamphlet about it in 1907 called \u0027The Waste of Daylight\u0027 about how people wasted valuable hours of light during the summer.          Founding Father of the United States Benjamin Franklin first had the idea to change the clocks while he was in Paris in 1784He was also a keen golfer and would become rather annoyed when it got too dark for him to continue playing in the evening.Sadly he died in 1915, a year before it was introduced in the UK.When the clocks went back last night, Britain reverted to Greenwich Mean Time. However, night workers may have had to work an extra hour, and those working on Sunday morning may have got confused with the time."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/28/11/51B826F000000578-0-image-a-8_1540725089731.jpg","title":"Harry pregnant Meghan attend Invictus Games basketball match","story":"    All smiles: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle addressed the packed closing ceremony of the Invictus Games on Saturday night    Jubilant: The pair are pictured at the Invictus Games on Saturday night in their last engagement in Australia before heading to New Zealand on Sunday morning          Meghan addressed the buzzing crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena which can hold 21,000. Meghan said: \u0027During this year\u0027s games in Sydney, I\u0027ve witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors.\u0027  In a short speech to the 12,0000-strong crowd in the Qudos Bank Arena, Meghan thanked organisers and athletes for making the Games so special          The Duchess said: \u0027It is such an honour to be here tonight, celebrating all of you and supporting my husband in the Invictus Games which he founded four years ago.\u0027    Prince Harry took the stage to rapturous applause.

The choir sang at the Invictus closing ceremony          As always when these Games close, I would like to start by saying thank you.To PK and Lieutenant General Peter Lay and the whole Sydney 2018 team - the vision and hard work has paid off and you have put on a truly magnificent Invictus Games.Thank you for being our partners over the last couple of years, and our team at the Invictus Games Foundation, especially Dominic Reid and Rose Hall, for their tireless efforts and hard work.To the people of Australia who filled the stands and cheered on the sidelines - thank you so much. Your energy powered our competitors all week and you made these Games your own by creating a typically Aussie atmosphere.To the friends and families who got our competitors to the start line and applauded them all the way to the finish line, thank you. You are all part of one big Invictus family and none of us would be here without you.And to the competitors goes the biggest thanks of all. You have once again left us humbled and inspired by your example, by your determination, by your service and by your sense of humour.Last Saturday, I spoke about how you were part of the Invictus generation. Your choice to serve your nations places you alongside those storied generations that have come before you, that fought two world wars and then secured a world order built on freedom, democracy, and tolerance.And of course this choice to serve - this choice to put yourselves at risk for the benefit of others - is at the very heart of what I founded these Invictus Games to celebrate. I wanted your service to be recognised.But what we saw again this week is that Invictus is so much more. Your example goes beyond the military community. It is about more than just your inspiring stories of recovery from injury and illness.It is about your example of determination, of optimism, of strength, honour and friendship, or as the Aussies call it \u0027mateship\u0027, as a core value that has the power to inspire the world.When we saw Paul Guest and Edwin Vermetten support each other through Paul\u0027s struggle with Post Traumatic Stress on the tennis court in front of a large audience, we saw what mateship really looks like.When Jakub Tynka fought through excruciating leg pain for the final 20 minutes of his cycling event, and let the cheering crowd and his fellow competitors Benjamin and Cedric push him over the finish line, we saw the definition of strength.When you saw Hannah Stolberg crossing the finish line on a bike which belonged to a late fellow serviceman whose values she strives to emulate, you witnessed the real meaning of honour.

She is pictured putting on  parachute with the US Army in Italy          Meghan Markle shakes hands with a group of sailors and gets a tour of the USS Ross in Spain when she visited bases while working on Suits  Ryan Patrick Novack of the United States competes in the Mens 400m in Sydney. Meghan referenced his courage in her speechIn travelling to these military bases, I was given a very special glimpse into the lives of those who serve our countries. I was able to see the unshakeable bond between servicemen and women on the ground together, but at the same time to feel the palpable longing for family and friends while deployed. Once home, the need for that anchor of support from loved ones, especially given how much it accelerates recovery and rehailitation is immeasurable. I\u0027ve been reminded of those memories here.During this year\u0027s Games in Sydney, I have witnessed the most amazing support networks that surround competitors, and I\u0027ve had the privilege of meeting several of these family and friends. The Novack family from Chicago is a prime example of this very thing. When their son, Ryan, suffered a severe injury leaving him paralysed from the waist down, doctors said he would never be able to walk again, but after speaking to his mum, Kerry, it was clear that it was through Ryan\u0027s strength of spirit and with the unwaivering support of his parents that he was able to prove all of those doctors wrong.Not only has Ryan competed in sailing, swimming and athletics this week, but when Harry and I saw him at the finish line of the sailing competition, he literally jumped into our boat, with dexterity and ease by the way, to give both of us a hug.Seeing Ryan\u0027s mum on the water that day, waving a flag to cheer him on was a moment I will never forget. The support system on the ground here in Invictus is something unlike any other because it\u0027s not just cheering on your own, but realising that by the end of this week, your own becomes everyone in the Invictus Family.It was, after all, only within 24 hours of meeting other families at the Games that another competitor\u0027s little girl was calling Kerry Aunty Kerry. This is what the Invictus Family is all about.On that note, I would like to invite everyone to please join me in a huge round of applause to thank all of the friends and family who have helped make these Games possible. Meghan turned heads in tuxedo-inspired Antonio Berardi halterneck in a green hue with a buttoned wrap detail around the waist that perfectly skimmed her growing baby bump.She accessorised with a crescent-shaped clutch bag and added a dazzling touch to the ensemble with statement earrings beneath her delicate chignon while Harry looked dapper in a light grey suit and white shirt.The couple earlier returned to Sydney just in time to watch the final day of the Games before heading to New Zealand for the last leg of their Commonwealth tour. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex  arrived at the wheelchair basketball final just after the match started at 2.10pm, receiving a standing ovation from the crowd. After the final whistle, pregnant Meghan went on court to give the Netherlands and USA players their medals and one cheeky Dutch player kissed her on the cheek.The bold move was technically a breach of protocol because the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with a neck bow (from the head only) - but informal Meghan touched the player on the shoulder and smiled as he kissed her. The Duchess was glowing in a $550 maroon crepe knit wrap top by Australian designer Scanlan Theodore. She wore a Remembrance Day poppy on her left side and paired the top with black tapered trousers and high heels.           A cheeky Dutch player gave Meghan a kiss on the cheek after the final whistle. According to Royal.uk the correct way for men to greet a member of the royal family is with \u0027a neck bow (from the head only).

Kalin said on Friday that the primary goal would be to \u0027clarify the steps to be taken for a political solution and to determine a roadmap\u0027. The steps could include a a commission to create Syria\u0027s post-war constitution, seen as a stepping stone to staging elections in the war-torn country. A United Nations plan for a committee to draft a new constitution ran aground this week after Damascus blocked the proposal, provoking anger among western powers.The Istanbul talks will also discuss extending the ceasefire around Idlib, where aid groups have warned that a military offensive could spark one of the worst humanitarian disasters of the seven-year war.Moscow and Ankara agreed a buffer zone as Turkey sought to avoid an attack leading to a further influx of people across its

He\u0027d put his hand up the back of her skirt – apparently getting a kick from both her boyfriend\u0027s ignorance and her powerlessness to stop him.\u0027Why did no one challenge him sooner,\u0027 the buyer asked me. \u0027Who\u0027s to say a hand cupping a buttock is worse than being shouted at while you\u0027re on the phone to a supplier in the Far East – yelling that you must make them drop their prices.\u0027It got to the point I felt sick every Sunday night at the prospect of going to work.

I met him in his boardroom at Arcadia HQ on Berners Street with its view of the London Eye before his chauffeur and bodyguard, Kevin, drove us to the Royal Academy, where his brands – Topshop, Evans, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton – were showing their wares to the press. In the limo, he chain-smoked Philip Morris – \u0027I have to have one pleasure in life\u0027 – and slagged off every designer store we passed. \u0027Stella McCartney? Never made two bob.\u0027 When I asked about his employees, his reputation as a rottweiler, he told me: \u0027I give a straight yes or no. They are empowered.\u0027He introduced me to his wife, Tina (who owns 92 per cent of Arcadia shares) and 14-year-old daughter, Chloe. When I later wrote that Chloe was wearing mukluk boots, which are made of fur, something banned in his stores, he complained to my editor, a soignee woman who that morning had no need of a blow dry.But he could be loyal.

He called me, swearing, and told me I was \u0027anti-Semitic\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 I said. \u0027These girls don\u0027t have much money. You were grooming them.\u0027 As, over the years, I refused to fawn over him, his mood swung between extremes. After I wrote a rave review of one collection, he sent me a gorgeous olive greatcoat, still warm from the model who\u0027d worn it. Later, after a bad review, his right-hand woman called me. \u0027He wants his coat back.\u0027The last time I spoke to Green was at an Evans show in the autumn of 2014. He\u0027d sat me front row of this plus-size show (now that\u0027s a laugh in Oliver Shah\u0027s biography, he is reported to have told a female buyer: \u0027You\u0027re absolutely f****** useless. I should throw you out the window but you\u0027re so fat you\u0027d probably bounce back in again\u0027), as I\u0027d been at the vanguard of a campaign to give big women the fashion they deserve. Afterwards he asked if we could pose together for the paparazzi. I said no. Unlike every female glossy editor in the land, I felt to do so would betray my readers. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to stand next to him, gurning.          I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening). Above, at Tate Britain in 2016Everyone in fashion knew he was a tyrant, but it\u0027s unreasonable to expect teenage models and junior employees to stand up to him you might wonder why anyone would sign a gagging order, but this was a seriously powerful man.So it was the responsibility of the senior company executives, editors, publishing directors and model agents to be on the side of the women who toil in low-paid jobs in stores and factories and lap up glossy fashion magazines.I can\u0027t help but remember the image, at his show inside the old Eurostar terminal in Waterloo, of American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, looking like the cat who got the zero fat cream because Green had arranged for her own personal escalator on which to glide in, and glide out (when approached for this story, her silence was deafening).I can\u0027t help but think back to the meetings of magazine editors and London Fashion Week bigwigs in the boardroom of Vogue House, where not one woman had the courage to say, \u0027What can we do about Philip Green?\u0027Or, later, as the BHS scandal erupted and the pension hole gaped, why even then did not one of them take him to task over the number of employees his greed was condemning to penury?My guess? They were too busy counting his advertising spend, and nursing their 40 per cent Topshop discount card.Even today, when I ask Caroline Rush CBE, chief executive of the British Fashion Council, who will have had more dealings with Green than most, if she ever took him to task, I\u0027m told her PA is away on honeymoon. I email the British Fashion Council press office and ask them to call her on her mobile. How bad is this for British fashion? Will he show next season? She doesn\u0027t ring back. It is her job to reply. This is what she is paid to do.Or Baroness Karren Brady CBE (don\u0027t you love all these titles?), who has been vocal about fighting sexism in business, and has been chair of Arcadia\u0027s parent company, Taveta, for eight years.I ask if she knew of allegations that Green gave female staff \u0027lingering hugs\u0027 and asked if they wanted their \u0027bottoms slapped\u0027 or, indeed, had paid substantial sums to settle complaints. Only her PA gets back to me: \u0027Karren is away until next week.\u0027 But this is important! She\u0027s got a phone, hasn\u0027t she? I visit her glorious villa next to Harrods no one answers the door.How about Naomi Campbell, who publicly attacked former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman – now a Mail on Sunday columnist – for having too many white staff? Did Naomi ever find Green racist? No reply.How about Kate Moss? Would she like to offer her support to him, given he\u0027d been so loyal to her in the past? She was \u0027about to get on a plane\u0027, apparently.Or Edward Enninful OBE, new super-erse editor of UK Vogue? No reply.Come on, then, Natalie Massenet, Net-a-Porter founder and one-time chair of the British Fashion Council? She can\u0027t be scared of anyone. She\u0027s a bleeding Dame! I get an email. \u0027Natalie is going to reach out to you.\u0027 I\u0027m still waiting.Isn\u0027t it telling that the only powerful person in British fashion I can find who is willing to speak out about Green is a man – although he doesn\u0027t want me to use his name.No longer employed by Topshop, he tells me: \u0027He\u0027s outrageous. This is all typical of him. Doing it in the first place is unacceptable, covering it up is ridiculous.\u0027Is he a sexual predator, a racist? \u0027The real issue is this: he will never be aware that he has done anything wrong. He just doesn\u0027t get it, he will never change.\u0027Is that why he left Green\u0027s company? \u0027I left because I didn\u0027t like the way he treated people. My mum told me that we are all equal, and that we should treat everyone with respect. He didn\u0027t treat anyone with respect.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Doctor sparks fan backlash Time Lord branded TVs politically correct show","story":"    In last Sunday’s episode, the Doctor and her companions travelled back in time to the moment black bus passenger Rosa Parks ignited the US civil rights movementMiss Whittaker’s Doctor is a hands-on feminist role model with extraordinary engineering skills. Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor is proving to be a stridently feminist role model who’s more than a match for her male predecessors when it comes to the worlds of science and heavy engineering. In her debut episode – set in the steel city of Sheffield – she donned industrial goggles and expertly wielded a blowtorch to knock up her own sonic screwdriver. One of her three companions, Ryan Sinclair – played by black actor Tosin Cole – is a dyspraxia sufferer, while even the token white middle-aged male, Graham (Bradley Walsh), is a cancer survivor.

I haven\u0027t had the life I should have.\u0027 Cardiff Crown Court was told the couple acted together to \u0027fulfil their sexual fantasies\u0027 by grooming the girls for sex before they were raped and assaulted. Their sickening campaign of abuse saw them ply one victim with vodka before forcing her to pose for indecent photos with them while they were naked.One of the three victims had made a complaint to South Wales Police in 2000 but the force chose not to take up her allegations.Judge Jeremy Jenkins QC said: \u0027The offences were committed against young, vulnerable and impressionable girls. \u0027The two of you had few, if any, sexual boundaries.\u0027          Ms Ambridge said Avril Griffiths (pictured) and her husband had begun grooming her when she was 13 buying her cigarettes, calling her pretty and making her feel \u0027noticed and grown up\u0027The court heard the couple took one victim \u0027dogging\u0027 in their A-Team van and passed her around other men.The girl was also raped during a sex party on a boat in the Bristol Channel. After the trial Ms Ambridge said: \u0027I don\u0027t trust men - in fact I hate them.\u0027I wanted more than one child but could never bear the idea of having sex. I hate to be touched. I know this has stopped me from having any meaningful relationships. I just feel so angry.\u0027Now that the trial is over and they are in prison I want to at least feel safe to walk out my front door again.\u0027I have flashbacks. I don\u0027t want to be tearful and scared. Even now I feel powerless by what they did. It has affected me so hugely.\u0027 Peter Griffiths was sentenced to 21 years in jail for eight counts of rape, three of indecent assault and two of taking an indecent photograph of a child .His wife was sentenced to 15 years in jail for five counts of rape, two of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two of indecent assault.   Ms Ambridge suffered a horrific attack in 1991 when she was given a spiked bottle of beer and woke up to find Peter Griffiths (left) on top of her with his wife (right) pinning her downBrave mum says she was groomed, drugged and raped by \u0027Welsh Fred and Rose West\u0027 couple - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/28/05/51B6D47800000578-0-image-a-31_1540704909112.jpg","title":"Halloween revellers enjoy frightfully boozy evening streets Britain","story":"    A couple dressed as Harley Quinn and the Joker are pictured on a night out in Manchester on Saturday evening  Some committed to their portraying their characters, including a couple dressed as Harley Quinn and the Joker (right), while others simply dressed to impress (left)Halloween costumes give customers a fright as big name...Trick or fail!

She tells us about her meditative approach and why ‘thinking too much is boring’A translucent bubble floats in the air next to a picture of a baby’s head cradled tenderly in an adult’s arms. Nearby, among an arrangement of similarly intimate images, an infant’s tiny hand is gently enfolded in an elderly grandparent’s grasp. On a single wall in the National Portrait Gallery, amid the contrasting styles and subject matter of the 2018 Taylor Wessing portrait prize, Rinko Kawauchi’s vivid images of four generations of her family create a quietly intense space in which to pause and ponder the beauty and fragility of the everyday.Recently, that sense of life’s frailty has become more acute for Kawauchi following the birth of her daughter, whose first few years have been captured in characteristically hypnotic images. Since Kawauchi’s arrival on the art scene in 2001 with the simultaneous publication of three photobooks, Utatane (“Catnap”), Hanabi (“Fireworks”) and Hanako (a Japanese girl’s name), her family have featured in her work alongside often breathtakingly beautiful photographs of the natural world – insects, rainbows, clouds, butterflies and, of late, sacred rituals and ancient sites in her native Japan. She is an artist of the quotidian sublime, creating a world in which the tiniest details – a slice of watermelon on a plate, a bird’s egg cracking open – are imbued with meaning as part of the greater whole, the great interconnectedness.The images on show at the NPG are a continuation of an ongoing project that began with her 2005 book, Cui Cui, which comprised photographs of extended family taken over the previous 15 years. In that time, she witnessed the death of her grandfather and the birth of her nephew. It is not, though, she insists, a work of “personal disclosure” – rather a visual contemplation of the cycle of life in all its sadness and wonder.She is, she tells me in her faltering but often poetic English, “in sympathy with small things in the bigness of nature”. Her approach is patient, deeply attentive, akin to a kind of heightened meditation. “It’s about finding a certain space of mind, if that makes sense. When I am shooting, I am following my intuition without thinking. Thinking too much is boring, not good. It stops the surprising from coming through. When a picture happens, I just say ‘thank you’ and move on. It is only afterwards that I become an editor and impose the meaning on the work.”In person, the diminutive Kawauchi is quietly spoken and self-contained one senses that her work is an extension of her self. It is difficult to imagine her operating in the combative world of commercial advertising photography, which she did for several years after graduating from college in the early 1990s. She cites the American master of the everyday William Eggleston as a formative influence, alongside the younger Japanese photographer Takashi Homma. Her early images, which often seemed like deftly composed snapshots, were bathed in natural light and washed with bright colour tones that added to their almost dreamlike quality.In 2004, Martin Parr gave her two gallery spaces when he guest-curated Les Rencontres d’Arles, and in 2006 she had a solo show at the Photographer’s Gallery in London. Back then, I noted that her work “might initially appear to approach the deadpan detachment that characterises so much contemporary art-photography, but on closer inspection there is always some glimmer of hope and humanity, some sense of wonder at work in the rendering of the intimate and fragile.” That remains the case, but, of late, her vision has widened and deepened. In 2013, her series Ametsuchi announced a departure of sorts. Using a large format camera mounted on a tripod, she shot from a distance, creating panoramas of the stark, elemental, volcanic terrain around Japan’s Mount Aso, a sacred site for Shinto pilgrims who gather there to perform often spectacular fire rituals.Last year, Halo continued her exploration of these bigger themes. In rural Japan and China, she photographed other religious fire rituals and the vast constellations above. On England’s south-east coast, she captured the wondrous natural spectacle that is the murmuration of starlings. The private and the everyday had suddenly given way to the celestial elemental, the tranquil to the spectacular. And yet, they remained Rinko Kawauchi photographs: striking, luminous, poetic.“Halo is really about the relationship between nature and the manmade,” she says, “There is something about time passing in all the work and, with Halo, it is about a practice that is unchanging for hundreds of years while the world changes around it.”Her work is changing in other ways, too. When she began making work, Kawauchi gravitated towards the photobook as the perfect medium for her closely observed images of the world around her. Now, she is intrigued with the possibilities of the moving image. To this end, in 2015 she created an installation in a gallery in Shinjuku of video works mounted on 30 monitors, her images, both intimate and elemental, unfolding to an ambient soundtrack of natural noises – wind, insects – and “music created on real instruments”.I ask her, in conclusion, if being a mother has changed her approach to her work. She thinks for a long moment. “I would say yes, but not in the expected way. In my personal life, it has been amazing of course as a photographer, I am not so sure.

The right soundtrack has the power to transform even a burger and chips into a fine-dining experience, at least according to research by Cornell University. Why? Because the music makes us eat more mindfully and even perceive our food more favourably.“Dinner parties are essentially about communication and the mingling of several different conversations, so you want background music that’s sophisticated enough to spark conversation, then melt away rather than competing with your chat,” says composer Oliver Davis, whose 2018 album Liberty recently topped the iTunes classical charts. So what music works best with different dishes? We spoke to a range of experts – from restaurateurs to party planners and composers to find out.Soundtrack for starters“I put as much thought and care into the music I play at a dinner party as I do into my cooking,” says restaurateur Asma Khan of the Darjeeling Express in Soho, London.Her favourite starter is a mutton shikampuri kebab, a recipe from the Royal Kitchens of Hyderabad. “It has a uniquely layered shah-jeera flavour,” she says. “You think it’s mild at first, then the cardamom and cumin spice blend hits you. Most people don’t recognise all the flavours, but this starter never fails to impress.”While guests dig in, Khan plays the classical Indian Sufi song Maula-e-Kull, sung by Abdida Parveen. “It has a very deep rhythm,” she says. “You don’t need to understand the words to feel the emotion in the voice of the singer: it starts off with the love between two people, then becomes deeply complex. Both the song and the starter have this incredible hidden layering, and together they set a rich, serene tone for your evening.”Your musical main“The right music helps the conversation flow, which is particularly important when your guests are meeting for the first time,” says Alice Matthews, founder of MotherHustler supper clubs.“I love the classical guitar interpretation of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Air on a G String, by Richard Mollenbeck,” she says. Like the vegetarian tagine she serves her guests, the music is about different interpretations of a classic, melodiously coming together to create something new. “I’ve discovered guests relax and enjoy themselves more when eating familiar food and listening to familiar music, but in a heightened, luxurious atmosphere,” she says.Sweet symphony“I love to cook with seasonal, locally sourced ingredients, and my taste in music reflects that too,” says Henrietta Inman, author of The Natural Baker: A new way to bake using the best natural ingredients.“For a dinner party I’ll make my plum, blackberry and blueberry crumble, served with a rosemary and lemon syrup. The topping is crunchy and decadent, made with wholegrain spelt, oats and almonds.” And the perfect accompaniment? The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, says Inman.“It’s a beautifully tranquil piece by an English composer and it brings to mind a dusky evening eating outdoors, with birds singing in the hedgerows and trees hanging heavy with ripe fruit,” she says.The tune for cheese“The cheese course comes at a perfect moment to steer conversation into another direction,” says La Fromagerie’s Patricia Michelson, author of Cheese.She recommends presenting a five-strong board with Sinodun Hill, a nutty goat’s cheese the creamy, sweet and aromatic Beaufort Chalet D’Alpage Lincolnshire Poacher Double Barrel, a hard cheese with a distinctive savoury acidity from the chalky soil where the cattle graze a decadent Brie aux Truffes and Regalis, a ewe’s milk blue that combines sharp mineral qualities with a rich, floral taste.On the playlist is a classical composition with a jazz vibe, such as the Jacques Loussier Trio playing Bach. “It’s reflective and stimulating but soft and flowing, and these are words I often use when describing cheese too,” says Michelson.The finale Just as a digestif serves to calm the mood at the end of the meal, music plays a similar role. “One of the wonderful things about music is it fills in any awkward silence at the end of your dinner party, when everyone’s said an awful lot,” says Davis.“I love an Amaretto, but I wouldn’t be as didactic as to suggest that a sweet liqueur goes with sweet music,” he says. “Go for something cosy that welcomes guests into your own personal comfort zone.”For that, try downloading Rêverie Nocturne by Giulio Regondi or Liberty by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing.

His consort song for five voices and five viols is effectively an early 17th-century rendering of the sounds of Cockney stallholders advertising everything from “lilywhite mussels and new fresh herrings” to “roasted sausage, hot puddings, fresh cheese and cream, and ripe strawberries”. It may well have been inspired by Clément Jannequin’s Voulez ouyr les cris de Paris – similarly including the everyday sounds of a Renaissance French street market.While today there are a few restaurants in which music students will entertain you with arias between courses, in centuries past musical accompaniment to dining was a common phenomenon. The concept only became formalised in the 18th century and the best-known collection of such work is Telemann’s Tafelmusik, (Table Music). Published in 1733, it is a traditional set of suites to be played by a small group of string players at banquets.A musical work inspired by food, which became a popular sensation following its 1898 London premiere, is Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The cantata for tenor, mixed chorus and orchestra sets part of Longfellow’s epic poem, delighting in the lush and sensual choral description of the sumptuous menu: “First they ate the sturgeon … and the pike … then on pemmican they feasted … and buffalo marrow, haunch of deer and hump of bison, yellow cakes of the Mondamin, and the wild rice of the river.”Belshazzar’s Feast (1931) depicts another impressive meal, this time a lavish banquet thrown by the hedonistic and hubristic Babylonian king. In the biblical cantata by William Walton, apart from generous libations of wine drunk from sacred goblets looted from the Temple of Jerusalem, Osbert Sitwell’s libretto does not tell us what was on the menu. However, a clue is given in a description of the city’s resources for such a meal: “fine flour, wheat, beasts and sheep”, which we might conclude, like the score, was lavish.On a smaller scale, Erich Korngold’s Die Gansleber im Hause Duschnitz, (The Goose-liver in the Duschnitz House) is a song written spontaneously by the Austrian composer following a meal in 1919, thanking his Viennese hosts by honouring their delicious main course, with his lyrics declaring: “Because a goose liver like this is a wondrous thing … when it’s browned, when it’s crisp and crackly …”In a rare instance of music from the perspective of the food itself, there is Olim lacus Colueram. Known as the Song of the Roasting Swan, the exquisite aria for tenor and chorus comes from the pseudo-medieval secular cantata Carmina Burana (1936) in which composer Carl Orff manages to create a sense of dizzying musical rotation as the roasting bird delivers its, er, swansong, with the tenor singing at the top of his range in sympathetic anguish.Turning to something more sugary, Hansel and Gretel, Engelbert Humperdinck’s 1893 operatic retelling of the Grimm fairy tale, features a gingerbread house covered in sweets. Tchaikovsky’s festive ballet The Nutcracker (1892) is also filled with confectionary, in which, following mice eating gingerbread soldiers, young Clara and her prince are whisked off to the Land of Sweets, which is ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy, an otherworldly character represented by a brand-new twinkling keyboard instrument, the celesta.Then there are cookbooks set to music. La Bonne Cuisine (1947) was inspired by Emile Dumont’s culinary guide. From it the American composer Leonard Bernstein arranged four recipes for mezzo-soprano and piano. The gastronomic delicacies are Plum Pudding, Ox-Tails, Turkish Delight and Rabbit at Top Speed – the last well-named, as the entire song-cycle is under five minutes. Three years later with Ode à la Gastronomie (1950), composer Jean Françaix showed that the French can also have a sense of humour when it comes to food. His lighthearted satire punctures the pretentious solemnity of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin’s 1825 tome La Physiologie du gout, offering a both comic and exquisite paean to the sensual pleasures of eating, setting the gastronomic ruminations as a choral work for 13 a capella singers.Eating, of course, provides a backdrop for dramatic action and consequently it often crops up in opera. A great example is Giacomo Puccini’s La Bohème, which migrates from a cold and empty flat in Montmartre to the local Cafe Momus. There, among the riot of life, street vendors shout their wares: “Oranges, dates, hot chestnuts, trinkets, crosses, nougat, whipped cream, fruit pies, toffees, finches, sparrows, dates, coconut milk, carrots, trout and plums.” The friends enter the bistro and order sausage, roast venison, table wine, dressed lobster, creme caramel and chicken, before leaving the bill for hapless sugar daddy Alcindoro.Finally, there is food inspired by classical musicians. French modernist Erik Satie ate only white foods, so for more mouthwatering invocations one must look to the Italians and dishes created in their honour. Neapolitan tenor Enrico Caruso had a sauce named after him by Uruguayan chef Raymundo Monti. Salsa Caruso is a warm sauce for pasta consisting of cream, onions, ham, cheese, nuts and mushrooms. Meanwhile, Tournedos Rossini is a steak dish created by French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in collaboration with the famously food-loving composer. It consists of beef tournedos pan-fried in butter, served on a crouton, topped with hot slice of foie gras, garnished with black truffle and Madeira demi-glace sauce.And for afters? How about peach melba, the famous dessert of peaches and raspberry sauce with vanilla ice-cream, created in 1892 by French chef Auguste Escoffier at London’s Savoy Hotel for the Australian soprano Dame Nellie. Quite a final movement, that is.Waitrose \u0026amp Partners know that food and music are the perfect pairing. Feeling inspired to cook your own masterpiece tonight?

Such is the interest in his new biography of Frederick Douglass, a book 10 years in the writing and a whole career in the making, he will be on the road till December.He takes off his lovingly battered Michigan State cap, picks up a coffee and sits down for another conversation.“I’m lucky there’s so much interest,” he says, “and I’m lucky to have a publisher that really cares to send me around. I’ve never done a book tour like this.”Not many Yale professors have. But Blight’s perseverance is entirely befitting of his subject. Douglass’s struggle against slavery and for black equality threads through 19th-century America, from plantation to whaling port, from the pulpits of Boston to the battlefields of bloody Virginia. In stunning detail, with literary verve appropriate to his subject, Blight has written a scholarly biography that often reads like a novel by Melville.Now he’s riding the rails, speaking from town to town. It’s easy to imagine his subject saying as he does: “There are times I wonder, ‘Did I already say that to this audience? No, I said that yesterday.’”Blight laughs. He laughs again when I mention Donald Trump.I have to, really. In February last year, marking Black History Month, Trump said: “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more, I notice.”As with anything the billionaire tweets or blurts, ballyhoo and controversy followed. Blight has already given his take: to the Washington Post on “the dangers of presidential ignorance” for the  on Trump as “the gift that keeps on giving”. In conversation, he duly concedes that the work of any historian is now coloured by the trials of the Trumpian age.“He’s the subtext of almost anything,” he says, “whether we like it or not. And I get asked this at talk after talk: ‘What would Douglass do about Trump?’ Or, ‘What about Douglass can we think of and use now?’”Such questions are valid. It may be a cliche to say history teaches us to avoid the mistakes of the past, not least because we never do. But it’s also true that readers always seek parallels with their own lives and times. The life of Douglass, Blight says, contains “a tremendous set of lessons for today, whatever issue we’re discussing in this wildly erse and amazing country we have here but a country completely ided.“‘Polarized’ is our new word. In the 19th century they called it “disunion”, in the civil war. Hopefully, we’re not going there.”We’re not – at least not now, over espresso on West 36th. But our subject matter remains explosive.Many Americans, Blight says, know the story of Douglass the slave, the fugitive, the campaigner for abolition. But most know less of his third act, the 30 years after slavery’s end in which white America lashed back and he saw much of his work torn down. Blight deals with this period at length on the page, fascinated by “this question of the radical outsider who becomes the political insider and what does that do to his own psyche, his own mentality, and his own sense of himself over time?”He finds a modern parallel: “Think of John Lewis and many, many other leaders of the civil rights movement … They’ve lived the same trajectory for more than 50 years, from ’64 and ’65, the civil rights acts, the Voting Rights Act. We have, ever since Reaganism, frankly, lived through a sustained reaction.The current president’s “conservative populism”, Blight says, “is a whole set of reactions to the great changes, to generalise, of the 1960s: the various liberation movements, women’s rights, gay rights, gay marriage, and then of course all of the great changes in race relations.“Douglass lived that very trajectory in the 19th century, as did others. But he is the most visible prototype of that.”Douglass was born in 1818, escaped from slavery in 1838, met Abraham Lincoln in 1863 and died in 1895. Writing his first full-length biography in nearly 30 years was never going to prove a simple task. Blight missed his first planned publication date, 2015, in part thanks to open-heart surgery.Now the book is here and it is the result of 40 years’ study, from Blight’s student days at Michigan State and Wisconsin-Madison through a spell as a high school history teacher and appointments at Cambridge, Harvard, Yale and elsewhere. And yet, as Blight says, it still “came about by sheer blind luck”.About 10 years ago, Blight “went to Savannah, Georgia, to give a talk to high school teachers on the Narrative” – the first of Douglass’s three autobiographies, published in 1845. It was something he had done many times. “But this time the host, the Georgia Historical Society, said, ‘There’s this local gentleman here who is a collector and he’d like to go to lunch afterward and meet you.’ And I said, ‘Eh, fine.’“And I met the most extraordinary man that day: Walter Evans. He took me over to his house, a big, beautiful, four- or five-story brownstone in Savannah, and it was absolutely chock full of African American rare books, manuscripts and art.”On return visits, the historian sat at the dining room table, drinking coffee, as treasures including Douglass family scrapbooks were brought out and spread before him.Such rich material, Blight says, “made me realize that if I don’t attempt to do this biography, somebody else will. And in fact, at first, I didn’t want to. It’s so daunting to take on the full life of somebody so complicated, so important and well-known. But I just decided, why not?”A decade on, the biography is dedicated to Evans and his wife, Linda. Reviews have been overwhelmingly positive, many noting Blight’s attention to Douglass’s development as a writer and speaker, his biblical language, his place as an American prophet. Some, though, have also highlighted the due diligence Blight performs on the more negative sides of the man.“There’s been a lot of work on Douglass going on,” Blight says, citing books by John Stauffer and others, “but not a full life like this. So that’s what I was attempting to do. And of course, you know, when you’re doing the full biography, cradle to grave, public and private sides of the life, there are things you’re gonna treat extensively and things you’re not gonna treat extensively. That was always the trick, how to balance.“I’m not letting him off the hook on his many human flaws. I call him ‘beautifully human’, whether that’s in his private affairs, his domestic situation with two marriages, his relationships with his children, which are fascinating. And revealing, because there a lot of letters between Douglass and his sons and his daughter.“There are times when he’s obstinate and arrogant and also hypersensitive, with good reason, to slights, whether they were racial or slights about his lack of any formal education.“He’s also, for vast parts of his life, an absent father. This is a man who could only make a living by travelling, by being a lecturer. So he’s gone most of the time his kids were growing up. They never, as far as I know, publicly complained about it, but you can sense it in some of the letters.”Blight senses a lot in Douglass’s letters, extrapolating, for example, a picture of a difficult relationship with his first wife, Anna Murray-Douglass. She helped Frederick escape from slavery, kept his house and raised his children. She also remained illiterate and increasingly slighted. Blight also discusses Douglass’s relationships with other women, controversial in their own time. And he considers Douglass’s attitudes towards Native Americans, Catholics, the Irish.“When he needed the argument, especially after the civil war, that black people were honest, thrifty, hardworking American citizens, he would say, ‘We have joined you in America. We are one of you. As opposed to the American Indians who just want to huddle in their blanket and go off to their hills.’“I’ve had students who when they read that, they say, ‘Oh, my God.’ They say, ‘Frederick Douglass thought that of them?’ Well, I’m sorry, he did.”In other words, Douglass was a man of his time, which was every bit as unforgiving as ours. Blight points out that though Douglass was an ardent supporter of women’s suffrage, the sole male speaker at the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, the question of the black vote prompted a split and “some brutal racism” towards Douglass from Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan Anthony, pioneers of women’s rights.And with that we are back where we started, discussing lessons that might be learned by Blight’s readers, particularly students, particularly those ranged against Trump and Trumpism on the political left.We discuss Douglass’s intellectual and political development, first under the influence of the great abolitionist William Garrison, through an extensive relationship with John Brown, the great insurrectionary dreamer, and on through civil war, Reconstruction and the violence of Jim Crow.In the years before the war, Blight says, what Douglass “really most fondly wanted was for something to happen, either politically, legally, or violently, that would cause some kind of breakup of the union, and some kind of sanctioned attack on the institution of slavery by federal action”.That breakthrough came with the founding of the modern Republican party.“He begins to learn hard the pragmatism of politics,” Blight says. “That you’re going to have to make deals. That you’re going to have to make relationships that aren’t comfortable. And that is what he ends up doing with that thing called the Republican party, which was born in 1854 and ran its first presidential candidate in ’56.”Perhaps with a mild rejoinder to Republicans under Trump who claim Douglass – like Lincoln – for their own, he adds: “Douglass was never comfortable with the Republicans. They weren’t radical enough for him in those first six years before the civil war. But he came to not only accept, but even welcome and admire the fact that the Republican party was devoted to stopping the expansion of slavery. They were not morally abolitionists as much as he wished, but nevertheless, they were threatening the south. The enemy of my enemy can be my friend.”Conversation done, coffee drained, Blight heads back to his book tour. Throughout all subsequent drafting and redrafting of this interview, two of Douglass’s most famous remarks demand inclusion, surviving every recasting and cut.In 1857, in Canandaigua, New York, Douglass delivered a speech marking the anniversary of emancipation in the British West Indies. “Power concedes nothing without demand,” he said. “It never did and it never will.”But in 1855, in Rochester, he said: “I would unite with anybody to do right, and with nobody to do wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d15f9a410a13b56a58bddbfefd654a7db9e6fcfd/0_275_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89dea75505faef782aad0f18d6c263b7","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

LAPFF has not received a response to the letter, sent on 12 October.The growing pressure on the Ryanair board follows a torrid year for the budget airline. During the summer and early autumn, staff across Europe staged a series of strikes in disputes over contract terms, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights.Ryanair last week officially recognised unions in Belgium, Spain, Portugal and the UK in a bid to improve relations with workers.“Ryanair faces a prolonged transition to a more stable employment model and improved industrial relations,” Greenwood wrote in his letter to Ryanair. He said the firm’s “governance has not kept pace” with changes needed in its operating model.“We consider that more genuinely independent representation on the board could have ensured that these changes were achieved more smoothly,” he wrote.Bonderman has spent more than two decades as chairman of the Ryanair board, after joining in 1996. The billionaire private equity investor was last year forced to resign from the board of the taxi app firm Uber following sexist comments about the gender balance on the US company’s board. He has indicated that he intends to stay on for another year, but investors want action sooner.LAPFF said it had concerns over Bonderman’s ability to challenge executives’ decisions, although his presence is considered to be emblematic of a broader lack of independence on the board. Kyran McLaughlin, another member of the board, was also the target of a rebellion at the September meeting on the grounds of independence. Almost a third of investors voted against his reappointment.Disquiet among investors grew last year when a rostering blunder forced the airline to cancel thousands of flights, denting the reputation of the hard-driving management team.Ryanair has since endured more unwelcome media coverage in the last fortnight, after a man allegedly racially abused a fellow passenger before takeoff from Barcelona.The firm was also forced to issue a profit warning last month, blaming the effects of strikes as well as rising oil prices for lower earnings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc8e857d5446df4a5ce52ac7321f9d85419c8c95/1_0_4546_2729/master/4546.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=215fda346b92113cfc9dc55e21ed565d","title":"has apple given its iphone xs camera worthy of its name","story":"At up to 5 trillion operations a second, the new XS model allows you to customise your ‘bokeh’ to perfectionIf you’re a keen photographer (which this columnist is) one of the things you prize most is a strange property called bokeh. It’s the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the parts of an image that are not of central interest – the way a lens renders out-of-focus points of light. You often see it in great portraits: the subject’s eyes are razor-sharp but the – potentially distracting – background is fuzzy.In the era when all photography was analogue, the only way to get good bokeh was to use lenses that produced narrow depth of field at wide apertures. Since the optical performance of most lenses decreased at such apertures, that meant that serious photographers faced a trade-off: their lust for bokeh involved compromising on overall image quality. And the only way round that was to spend money on lenses of complex design and exceedingly high optical quality. Neither of these came cheap: a photo-buff of my acquaintance, for example, recently laid out a small fortune for a Leica Noctilux f0.95 aspherical lens, which, its manufacturer claims, provides “unique bokeh”. (At a retail price of £9,100 it jolly well ought to.)Good though the iPhone camera became, however, it never impressed camera buffs, who disdained its small sensor, relatively poor performance in low light conditions, sparse manual controls, etc. And, of course, it couldn’t give good bokeh. So while it fulfilled the first law of photography (which says that the best camera is always the one you happen to have with you) the iPhone couldn’t be taken seriously as an actual camera.Until recently, this was my view too. But the recent arrival of the iPhone XS has sown serious doubts. The key moment came when using it in “portrait” mode. You take the photograph as usual: the person you’re snapping grins inanely in the time-honoured way and – bingo! – there is the image. The exposure is perfect and the subject is razor-sharp – but so is the irritating background, including that hot-dog vendor you hadn’t noticed at the time. But under the image there’s a graduated scale labelled Depth and a slider. Move the slider and gradually the vendor goes out of focus until he’s satisfactorily fuzzy. You’ve suddenly got good bokeh! But whereas in the analogue days, whatever bokeh you got was immutably fixed the moment you pressed the shutter, now you can adjust it retrospectively.Welcome to the world of computational photography. One of the most astonishing revelations of the recent past was that Apple had 800 engineers working just on the camera for the iPhone – which led one to wonder if Nikon or Canon had anything like the same level of R\u0026ampD effort. Now we are finding out what all those geeks have been doing. Essentially, they have added a second camera (with a telephoto lens), upped the quality of the sensors and harnessed the power of the phone’s A12 processor and a specialised machine-learning module (called the “neural engine”, if you please) to analyse everything those cameras see.In “portrait” mode, for example, the neural engine can do up to 5 trillion operations per second. (Yes, you read that correctly.) Firstly, it uses machine learning to distinguish faces in the frame. Once a face is detected, facial analysis enables it to apply appropriate portrait lighting effects to it. The A12 processor then teams up with the neural engine to separate the subject from the background, so that when you move the slider the rendering of the background becomes increasingly fuzzy.This is computation on a dizzying scale, happening in milliseconds on a device that you hold in your hand. Professional photographers will still say that while the results may be electrifying for amateurs, you still can’t get acceptable billboard-scale images from an iPhone. And maybe they’re right. But I suspect that many photographers will come round to seeing things Apple’s way – that “a picture is worth a trillion operations”. Especially when it’s got good bokeh.Rebel without pawsEver wondered how Julian Assange is getting on in the Ecuadorian embassy?

Something with a late-capitalist theme, perhaps? Something that leaves you feeling just a little bit empty inside? Well, I have just the series. I recently discovered Stay Here, a property programme with a modern twist. Instead of featuring hard-to-please couples searching for their dream home, Stay Here features a couple of extremely irritating real estate experts, who are helping people optimise their homes for Airbnb. The hosts traverse the US giving homeowners design and marketing tips so they can “succeed in the world of short-term rental”. A sample soundbite: “If you can rebuild it, I can rebrand it.”What’s so wrong with succeeding in the world of short-term rentals, you may ask? If you listen to Airbnb, the short-term rental market is a brilliant way to foster community, revitalise neighbourhoods, help ordinary folk make ends meet and bring about world peace.Not everyone is of this opinion, of course. In recent years, as Airbnb and other vacation rental platforms such as HomeAway have exploded in popularity, there have been increasing concerns that they are exacerbating the unaffordable housing crisis. Various studies support this idea, and there is also plenty of anecdata: I have a friend who was just about to sign a lease on an apartment in Brooklyn when the landlord decided it would be more profitable to turn it into an Airbnb instead.Don’t expect to find stats about dwindling housing stock or stories about gentrification in Stay Here. The series, which is classified by Netflix as a “feel-good” show, does not delve into the dark side of the short-term rental market. Rather, it is more focused on parroting the Airbnb message that short-term rentals are a lifeline for the struggling middle class.In the first episode, for example, Stay Here’s roving realtors revamp a houseboat owned by a married couple in Seattle. The couple (who don’t live on the boat, but in a non-floating home nearby), are eager to stress that the boat isn’t a luxury they’re milking for as much as possible. “I run a non-profit, she’s a professor,” the husband says. “We’re not real-estate tycoons.” Rather, they say, they are renting it out to help pay their bills. They have a small daughter “whose childcare costs as much as college costs in Seattle”. It is truly heart-warming when untrammelled capitalism can help solve financial problems caused by untrammelled capitalism.There are a few moments in Stay Here, to be fair, when the show hints at the fact that short-term rentals can do long-term harm to communities. In one episode, set in Bed-Stuy, a rapidly gentrifying part of Brooklyn, the homeowner being profiled makes it very clear that he is trying to keep his rental prices down because he wants to ensure the neighbourhood he has lived in for decades remains a “working-class community”. For the most part, however, these glimpses into the more problematic aspects of the sharing economy are rare. The overall moral of the show is “monetise, monetise, monetise”.It’s this obsession with monetisation that bothers me most about Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms. The so-called sharing economy is more accurately the monetise-everything-you-can economy. Your home used to be a place where you lived. It represented security and stability. Increasingly, however, as shows like Stay Here underscore, home is no longer where the heart is it’s where the monetisation opportunities lie.One of the best things about being in a relationship, I have decided, is no longer having to go on dates where you are asked the inevitable question: “What do you like to do in your spare time?”It should be an easy thing to answer, shouldn’t it? It’s not as if someone is asking for a mathematical explanation of the mass gap. It’s not as if someone has asked you to describe, in iambic pentameter, why Ed Sheeran is so popular. They are just asking you what you like to do in your spare time.The problem, however, is that I have no idea how to answer. When I was a child, I had hobbies. I liked to collect rocks. I liked to go rock climbing. You know, all the normal things a socially awkward child likes to do. But hobbies are more complicated as an adult. The things I enjoy doing most (sleeping, mainly) can’t really be classed as hobbies. They are just normal human activities that normal humans do. When I cast around for the slightly more unusual pastimes I enjoy, they are not exactly things you can share with first dates. For example, I really enjoy making bonfires. But telling a girl you just met off Tinder that you love starting fires generally does not result in a second date.For anyone else who may be struggling with this issue, I have got your back! I have recently come up with a brilliant (if I say so myself) hobby-hack. If you want to turn the most mundane of activities into an impressive-sounding hobby, just put the words “intermittent”, “extreme” or “experimental” in front of it. Saying “I enjoy napping”, for example, makes you sound lazy. But saying “I enjoy intermittent napping” sounds science-y and intriguing. Experimental napping is even better.Disneyland, it turns out, is not just the “happiest place on Earth”, it also is a very popular choice for the afterlife. According to a recent Wall Street Journal investigation, an alarming number of people want their ashes scattered at Disney World or Disneyland. Apparently, an ash-scattering incident happens about once a month. What’s more, the Haunted Mansion (a spooky ride full of fake ghosts) “probably has so much human ashes in it that it’s not even funny,” one Disney worker told the Journal. I don’t want to take the mickey, but come on – that is quite funny, isn’t it? At the very least, I would say it is ironic.

First comes the revelation. Then days of salacious headlines. Then the moment of reckoning: a powerful man either loses his job. Or he doesn’t. And on we go until it all happens again. When #MeToo first exploded, I shared the optimism about its capacity to create change: not just for the victims of the rich and famous, but also for those whose transgressions are never going to be newsworthy. Today I’m much warier.It’s undoubtedly satisfying seeing some big cheeses get their richly deserved comeuppance, but it has its limits. Sometimes a genuine expression of remorse and a promise to do better might be preferable. And the very thing that has made #MeToo impactful – its short-circuiting of the due process that has failed women for decades – was only ever going to work against a handful of predators, in part because the more revelations that emerge, the more they lose their capacity to shock. But also because exposing a few famous men for what they are is probably not the most effective way of reshaping what men can and can’t get away with in workplaces far from the media glare.That’s not the only thing holding back the movement. In recent months, it’s become clear that people who are no allies of #MeToo are all too keen to marshal it for their own ends. We’ve seen that happening in the US, where alt-right bloggers have pledged to use it to bring down liberal opponents of Trump. And we’ve seen it here, where John Bercow’s longstanding critics have used serious (and as yet uninvestigated) allegations of bullying against him and findings that the House of Commons – of which he is chief officer – has a toxic culture of bullying and harassment to call for his resignation.In theory, there’s no problem. Who cares what’s motivating someone else? Judge each case on its merits. But it matters psychologically: the bandwagon-jumping morphs the debate so it’s no longer about what happened to the alleged victims but about something else altogether. It pushes people into ignoring the transgressions of their allies out of distaste at the prospect of lining up alongside their foes.That way lies hypocrisy. And if by any chance you think it is limited to one side – Republican senator Susan Collins casting her swing vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court after delivering an impassioned speech on why #MeToo is long overdue – think again. Two weeks ago, Hillary Clinton – she of the “I’m with her” slogan – was questioned on whether her husband should have stood down over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. No one was expecting a yes. But this self-professed feminist, the first major-party female candidate for US president, couldn’t even rouse a “no comment”. Instead she defended the indefensible, perpetuating the myth that it’s OK for the most powerful man in the world to accept oral sex from his intern in the Oval Office, because it was “consensual”.It would be unfair to single out Clinton. The Labour party – the clue’s in the name: it’s there to champion workers – has utterly failed to hold Bercow to account for his leadership of the Commons. A Labour MP, Kate Green, cast the deciding vote to block an investigation into the allegations that he subjected some of his staff to severe bullying, leaving one suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – accusations that he denies. In a recent Commons debate about bullying and harassment in parliament, Labour MPs had the gall to accuse Bercow’s critics of bullying him. And what a great takeaway for abusers this was, from the veteran Labour campaigner Margaret Beckett. In defending Bercow’s position, she said “abuse is terrible”, but that Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”. You can’t (rightly) pooh-pooh Brett Kavanaugh for wheeling out irrelevant character witnesses (would-be rapists aren’t necessarily awful to all the women in their lives) and then proclaim: “But John Bercow’s been such a great reformer!” There isn’t some utilitarian calculus that means abuse gets outranked by other considerations. And it’s wrong to call out the hypocrisy of others without confronting your own cognitive dissonance about friends who may also be bullies and harassers.So long as we judge the predators we like differently, we’re all, to some extent, complicit. Only when people feel able to call out those they like and love will we see progress. If not, we’ll at best be stuck in a holding pattern of revelation then resignation for years to come. At worst, #MeToo will be discredited through its capture by those who don’t give two hoots about what it stands for, so long as they can use it to take down their supposed enemies.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5887ca3f1208c95f107041f882b057a964902770/0_19_2222_1333/master/2222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de321fdab8423e8c922d1077227a8d06","title":"the guardian view on the 2018 budget end austerity for the nations sake","story":"When Theresa May addressed the Conservative party conference earlier this month, her audience were primed for what she had to say about Brexit. But the most interesting part of the speech was when she pledged to “end austerity”. The British public are fed up with the idea that after the financial crash the country could cut itself to growth. But the state has been deliberately rolled back, reducing aggregate demand when the economy would have benefited from it. The result has been an immiseration of ordinary people and the forced decay of the public realm. Austerity failed as it turned a nascent recovery into stagnation.The problem for Mrs May’s Treasury is that it has to square two conflicting aims: that of ending austerity and that of meeting self-imposed fiscal targets. By borrowing more, and with stronger than expected tax receipts, there’s a possibility that the chancellor, Philip Hammond, could in Monday’s budget ensure that no government department need face any drop in its real-terms spending per person after 2020. That might be construed as ending austerity. Getting to that point depends largely on whether Mrs May is capable of successfully navigating the intellectual and political minefield that is Brexit.Suppose she does, and remains prime minister, Mrs May will probably be able to say that the Tory target to lower debt as a share of GDP can be reached if we define the end of austerity in these terms. But the current Conservative policy of reaching overall fiscal balance over the medium term could not be met – it would still require further cuts or tax rises. That is why without a radical shift in policy the prime minister’s rhetoric of ending austerity is fundamentally disingenuous.Governments are not like households, which are unable to continually spend more than their income for fear of becoming insolvent. Yet Conservatives have falsely claimed for a decade that bankruptcy was a possibility. Whether or not it is a good time to increase deficit spending is a question of how much slack there is in the economy. In the UK there is a good case for fiscal expansion. Politicians need to start relating public spending to the size of the economy. The deficit on current spending has been eliminated.There are genuine sharp political choices to be made about economic direction. Tories might favour tax cuts. But a fairer economy requires broad-based tax rises. Public attitudes are shifting towards accepting higher taxes and spending. Whether the chancellor can meet the nation’s mood will be crucial in deciding if the Tory party can defuse the economic crisis – or intensify it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fba43cfe6edcd7393bbb7385aee5936d1162b8f3/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=769ea0650555483a1f7d5bd674c259e8","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of towering","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘towering’The closing date is Wednesday 31 October at 10am.

Mention that the Bard of Salford was to visit the Observer office for this interview last week immediately prompted snatches of extemporised quotation from some of Clarke’s more famous lyrics – I Wanna Be Yours, Evidently Chickentown, I Married a Monster from Outer Space – from those colleagues who had some grounding in his snarly Mancunian vowels and those who were not afraid of pretending. Nick Cohen, our columnist, broke off from columnising to recite extended passages of Clarke’s verse first committed to memory when the poet was sharing spittle-flecked stages with Buzzcocks and the Sex Pistols back in the day. Dr Clarke, as he styles himself, wearing his honorary doctorate from Salford University with pride, has always had that effect to the many devotees of his live performances over five decades, he is both much imitated and inimitable.He arrived in traditional garb: pointed boots, strides clinging to stick-insect legs, dark jacket, buttoned-up white shirt, generous shades, Ronnie Wood hair beneath a tall grey felt hat. He will turn 70 next year. One of the more fortunate breaks in his poetic career, he suggests, was that he looked like a punk before punk rock arrived. He had fixed on his sartorial style in the unlikely arena of Bernard Manning’s Embassy Club, where he acted as compere in the early 1970s, warming up an audience united by their shared antipathy to performance poetry. The outfit was another form of fighting talk, one he has stuck with in a journey that has seen some extremes.Clarke lost much of the 1980s to a heroin addiction, when he lived in a flat in Brixton with Nico, the late singer and muse of the Velvet Underground he dislikes any attempt to glamorise that period, and is reluctant to discuss it in detail.A long renaissance in the years since has resulted in perhaps greater popularity now than ever. His perennial UK tours – he is just about to embark on another – are invariably sold out to audiences of all ages. There have been some landmark events to prompt this: Arctic Monkeys’ dreamy 2013 cover of I Wanna Be Yours the use of Evidently Chickentown as the backing in one of the most memorable sequences in box-set TV, at the end of an episode of the final season of The Sopranos the fact that his poems have made it on to the GCSE syllabus. But mostly it is down to his brilliant rambling dramatic monologue of a stage show, which has become less staccato over the years. He used to have to fight his audiences to be heard now they hang on his every inflection.Clarke has lived for the past 25 years in Colchester, Essex. He speaks with love of the life he has created there, referring often to his wife, Evie, and daughter, Stella, his guiding lights. Though he has travelled a long way from his native Salford, it has never left him. It was once observed of Alan Bennett that the world invariably becomes an Alan Bennett sketch around him. Much the same is true of Clarke, from the other side of the Pennines.I’ve interviewed him once before, that time on the telephone, and was struck how – just as on stage – there appeared no subject under the sun which he could not bend to his comic will. Much of that gift lies in his voice: you can’t help but smile when he talks. He came into the office pulling a suitcase and immediately he sat down he was unzipping it to reveal his latest pride and joy, a handsome hardback collection of his poetry, entitled The Luckiest Guy Alive. The cover features a Peter Blake painting of his stick man profile, and embossed graphics in Scrabble tiles. “Kind of literate punk,” he said.I explained to him the format of this interview. Some questions have been submitted by famous admirers of his, others by Observer readers.“Fire away at me at random, Tim,” he said. “Give me what you’ve got.”I began with a question from one of the many performers who, no doubt, owe just a little bit of their style and delivery to watching Clarke with an audience, seeing how it might be done.Where do you get your trousers from?The short answer, Jarv, is River Island or Marks \u0026amp Spencer, the skinniest they do. For a while, though, I have had some problems with the craze for the low-rise pant, the hipster. Now, I’m no expert, but I think when it comes to guys, the less said about the hips the better. To make the hips the focal point of a pair of trousers is, to me, a fashion mistake. It was a mistake in the 60s and it doesn’t look any better on some fat fuck in Shoreditch now.My trouser needs are simple: a narrow leg in a dark colour, with jean detailing. That’s another thing I have always avoided: peg tops. I learned a long time ago that if you wear trousers where you can put something in the pockets, you will put stuff in those pockets – and before you know it you are clad in jodhpurs. Capacious trouser pockets are like a new living-room shelf: the moment you put it up it becomes occupied not only by favoured “ornaments” but by half-squeezed-out tubes of Neutrogena hand cream and stuff. And you will live with those items for years, halfway up the lounge wall. It’s the same with trouser pockets in my experience.So, to answer Jarvis’s inquiry: by default, during the low-rise years, I strolled the feminine range on the ground floor of Marks \u0026amp Spencer. I like a high waist if anything, like a flamenco dancer… that rakish, swashbuckling look. I have to confess that jeggings were one solution. A much underrated garment, the jegging: they never need ironing and they hold their colour.I found your poem Kung Fu International on one of my dad’s punk CDs when I was eight (I’m 33 now), and I remember listening to it over and over, and pausing so I could write each word down and learn to recite it. I credit this experience as one that led me to a lifetime of writing. What was the first song or poem you remember learning the words to?That’s a good question, Michael, because that is exactly how I did get introduced to poetry – at school, Michael Gove-style. We had to learn The Lady of Shalott, by the late, great Alfred, Lord Tennyson, which was 12 pages long, and I have to say I am all the better for it. The way poetry works is this: you learn the sound of the words first. You are not going to understand The Lady of Shalott – you are a 10-year-old boy in Salford and it was written by a 33-year-old bloke 150 years ago. But that’s the secret: the sound of the language, those sonorous words.To approach a poem as if it is a puzzle to be understood is to miss the point. And we had to know the whole 12 pages, because on command, at any moment, you might be called on to stand up and recite a particular verse. I am sure some of my classmates felt their time could have been more profitably spent. But I have to say that view was by no means unanimous. We had a brilliant English teacher called John Malone, who somehow conveyed his love of 19th-century poetry to an entire class of rough kids at Higher Broughton secondary modern school. And it caught on. He brought about this hothouse atmosphere of competitive poetry recital. In the way I imagine that rappers subsequently did in Compton, Los Angeles. Erstwhile louts trying to out-verbal each other, in a flamboyant, slightly foppish way.Tim Adams: I imagine you held your own in those battles?Oh, I was the king of the block. It goes without saying. Those English periods were a happy time. Apart from them, I hated every second of school.Who were the lyricists who inspired you to write the way you do? That’s an intelligent question too, from Ben, because lyricists have probably influenced me more than any other poets.TA: You were more Sinatra than Elvis back then?No. I mean Elvis was a world-changing event for me. Elvis and Frank, though, was the first glimpse of an eternal conflict I could never resolve. I will never resolve.What are your recollections of touring with the reggae poet Linton Kwesi Johnson?They are only good, put it that way. One thing: when I met Linton, I knew I had to tighten up my game in the wardrobe department. He set a very high bar. Back then there was only me and him doing poetry on stage, so we cranked it up a gear, not least because our audiences often had no prior interest in poetry.I have another reason to thank Linton: we went on tour together in 1981, all around the UK, and when we appeared in Essex, that is when my wife was first introduced to my work. I didn’t meet her then, but she was in the audience. So: thanks, Linton! I can’t talk that guy up enough.Have you realised you would have to change very few lyrics of your poem The It Man for it to be a rant about President Trump. Are you a soothsayer? Have you ever seen Our Cartoon President? It runs every teatime on television in the States. It is sensationally good, in the manner of Family Guy or King of the Hill. It is merciless about Trump, but even so, you can’t ignore the fact that even then he somehow still tends to come out on top. That is the story of the Donald, and because in this business I learned long ago you should never knock success, I can’t help admiring the crazy fucker in some way. Is that the crime of the century? He has at least stopped Kim Wrong Un from exploding his bombs.What is it that mono can do that stereo can’t?Hi Lauren. Well, for one thing, mono could produce the Phil Spector “wall of sound”. You couldn’t have that in stereo. That glorious bank of french horns bleeding into a mess of cellos and strings. I tend to live by the dictum “less is more”, but that mono sound proved more can be more. It is also more true to life. If you went to see a band, the Beatles, the Stones, they were up there on the stage you would naturally expect all the sound to come from their general direction. What do you want to listen to the bass player over your left shoulder for? Stereo is some nerd twiddling his knobs. The only stereo I like is a jukebox: two speakers but both on the same piece of furniture. Phil Spector is obviously out of circulation right now, but I am keeping the faith alive. Stereo, my ass.What is the worst act you opened for, and why? Caius Caligula? Is that a stage name? I hope so. Worst act? I wish I had an answer. Show business isn’t easy and it instinctively goes against the grain to do my fellow performers down. But let’s rack our brains. Surely there’s some dead bloke? No. The truth is, Caligula, if I was opening for them, they were better than I was. Otherwise they would have been opening for me.Which of your poems are you most satisfied with?Well, that is a typically clever question from Christopher, who did a memorable performance of Evidently Chickentown in that Danny Boyle film Strumpet, written by Jim Cartwright. And since you ask, Chickentown is among my favourites, not least because of that and its appearance in the penultimate episode of The Sopranos. There is no greater accolade for me.Is Chickentown about Stevenage? I never put a geographical stamp on it. I figure any town in the whole world has an equivalent of the fictional neighbourhood I describe. I wasn’t thinking of Stevenage, though I did live there for a couple of years. People used to go on about how soulless life in those new towns was, but that was not my experience of Stevenage. I thought it was fabulous: great amenities and lavishly fenestrated new houses, with generous garages. That movie, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, starring Barry Evans, for which Traffic did the theme, was set there. Barry Evans and his young friends were all mods in a mod town.I was in Salford when I saw that. And I thought: “Wow, imagine being young and living in a mod town like Stevenage!” And then I did for a couple of years. And the people weren’t “soulless” at all they were quite chummy in my recollection.I hardly ever get the trains these days, but I know one thing for a fact: they should spend a few billion on improving the current network rather than on HS2. Who on earth needs to get to Manchester 15 minutes quicker? No one can be that busy. And then when you arrive at the so-called Northern Powerhouse, you will find you can’t get a train to Blackpool or Burnley for about two years. It will be Murder on the Bus Replacement Service. There they are, bulldozing these beautiful villages so someone can get to Manchester quarter of an hour earlier. Who ever asked for that? I’m thinking of withholding my tax until they call a halt to HS2. Why not Skype if you are that keen to connect at speed?TA: Do you do much Skyping?Never. I don’t possess the equipment. But theoretically, on planet Bizarro, where Superman is bad and Lex Luther is good, that is what I would do.I discovered your music and spoken word when I was a teenager, and it was very inspirational to me. What wisdom would you impart to young girls who look up to you in 2018?Young girls who look up to me? Well, Kate, my first thought is: they should find somebody else. I’ve never been good at advice. I’ve done everything the wrong way. If you had any sense you wouldn’t look to me for any life lessons.What’s your favourite word? Mine is “arbitrary”… I keep meaning to get a favourite word. Everyone seems to have one. My answer is this, though: they all have their uses it’s invariably a matter of context.Was Jon the Postman the real voice of Manchester?I’d obviously argue not, Jason. Jon the Postman would climb up on stage at any gig he attended and do an impromptu a cappella version of Louie Louie by the Kingsmen. That performance undoubtedly made him a popular figure in the Manchester pub scene of the mid-1970s. I think he moved to the States for a while, but I’m not sure the act travelled with him. He knew my brother, who still works for the GPO, the Royal Mail, so we have a bit of baggage, you might say. For that reason, perhaps I am not best placed to objectively gauge the enigmatic appeal of Jon the Postman.You helped the Fall in the early days, letting them rehearse in your house, and you were a lifelong friend of the other Bard of Salford, Mark E Smith. Was there ever any talk of you joining the Fall?Are you kidding? I’m self-employed, my friend. I didn’t get into show business to be pushed around by the likes of Mark E Smith. Having said that, every incarnation of the Fall had something different, but the one thing they all had in common was the sensational live act that was Mark Smith. He was a magic realist right to the end. He had it all.I should say that all my characters are an amalgam or something, Craig, but Vince was the bloke in the downstairs apartment when I lived in Plymouth for a while, real name Frank. Every time I saw him he had a meat-cleaver in his hand and the look of a man who might have been Henry Cooper’s psychotic kid brother. It is fair to say we were not on expansive speaking terms. I believe he remained unaware of my poetic tribute.Was Nico easy to live with? Yes. She was exemplary. You wouldn’t have known she was there.When you first started out, did you get stage fright? And if so, how did you combat it?I didn’t get it too bad. Partly that was because ever since I was a teenager I had been taking what you might call pep pills, so I was invariably a little bit artificially jazzed up when I walked out on stage. This was at Bernard Manning’s Embassy Club in Manchester. It wasn’t easy: it is an unnatural act to get out there and draw that much attention to yourself. My answer back then would be, as they say, to be hopped up on goof balls. But since then, now I don’t get a bad time from hecklers, and invariably enjoy the love of the poetry-reading public, it has become a much more relaxed affair.As an audience member I know what I get from watching you perform. However, I am interested in what you get out of it. Do you get some element of therapy from writing and performing your poetry? No. No way do I ever approach my work as a way of working out my own problems. Many people have told me that they do use the writing of poetry to concentrate their mind on some pressing metaphysical problem. But not me. I think of it more like Tin Pan Alley work.The truth is I’m not just a practitioner of poetry when I am on stage… I am like the police: never off-duty. It is a romantic picture, that idea of Cole Porter always writing lyrics on the back of cigarette packs and menus. But that is really the way I do it, keeping that dream alive. I don’t try to explain it. As the great Bill Withers once said, “the writing of songs involves a kind of magic I don’t mess with”.TA: Would not doing it ever be an option?Not for me. Writing is the prism through which you see the world. Anything can kick you off.To take one of my more popular poems, Beasley Street: I worked my way back on that one. I had the last line. The template was the 1933 Busby Berkeley movie 42nd Street. The big production number at the end concludes, you recall, “Naughty, bawdy, gaudy, sporty, Forty-second Street”. And I thought I would do that, but with a lousy street. I spent quite a while thinking of the right adjectives: greasy, cheesy and so on, and then looked for a street name that toned in, but was credible. And there it was: Beasley, asking for it.I really like the idea of being a poetic hack. I believe it’s the kind of thing Charles Baudelaire aspired to: you know, the guy with the overview, a mirror reflecting the entire Parisian crowd.Every man Jacques of them.Have you ever been offered an honour by the Queen, Sir John? I’ve never been offered an honour by the Queen, but I’d be happy to accept.How do you feel about Brexit… not the crap leading up to it, but the actual exit?I don’t even want to talk about it, to be honest. I hate the word itself. When it first started to appear on the front of the paper – the  was the worst offender – by the time I found out what it meant I was too annoyed to want to think about it. I know for many people our departure from the EU is the worst thing that’s ever happened. For me, I think it might turn out to have some gifts – but don’t get me wrong, my wife is French and half of my daughter’s relatives live in France. We go and see them and they come and see us and we benefit from frictionless border controls. But if you ask me, I do think the free movement of working people has impacted badly on the poorest members of our society, which is bad for both the immigrant workers and bad for our workers, because it has driven down wages and conditions.What are your feelings about Jaywick?Don’t get me started on Jaywick. It is a kind of a dream town, as I’m sure Wilko knows, coming as he does from nearby Canvey Island. Jaywick is next to Clacton on the Essex coast. It was created originally as a holiday place. Every style of English suburban house is represented there, but all at two-thirds scale. They were built as holiday chalets, but people now live permanently in them. The Kray family had a bolthole there. When I moved to Essex, among the first things everyone said was “Don’t ever go to Jaywick, it’s a toilet”. But I persuaded my wife to drive me there one weekend and on arrival I turned to her and said: “We’ve never been here before, sweetheart, but I sure have dreamed about this place.” The streets are all sand. There are two pubs: the Three Jays and the Sheldrake. If memory serves, you are marginally safer in the Three Jays. The theme of the big estate is the great British automotive industry: Wolseley Drive and Morris Road and Austin Crescent. Keep it quiet, but I plan to make a movie in Jaywick some day.What’s your favourite gig venue, and why?It has to be the London Palladium, at which I have the honour of appearing again next month. That’s the gold standard, not just for me, but worldwide. Look who’s played there: Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra, Bob Hope, you name them. When Lenny Bruce was reduced to doing little 100-seat nightclubs he had this whole brilliant routine about a washed-up comedian who’s given one last bite of the apple. His agent’s saying: “Don’t go screwing it up again, you’re opening for Doris Day at the London Palladium.” And why did Lenny choose the Palladium for that routine? Because he was confident that in whatever borscht-belt e he found himself they’d immediately get the reference: “Hey, that’s the place the Queen of England goes.” What a thrill walking out there. If it’s true, as I claim in the title poem of my book, that I am the Luckiest Guy Alive, it’s for two reasons. First, there’s my domestic situation, my wonderful wife and family. And then this other life where I am appearing at the Palladium. The Luckiest Guy Alive? I rest my case.• The Luckiest Guy Alive by John Cooper Clarke is published by Picador (£14.99).

A red silk velvet bag found in the attic of West Horsley Place, former home of Raleigh’s son, could have been used by Raleigh’s widow to carry around his embalmed head, according to the stately home and a historical costume expert. Accounts of the beheading in Whitechapel, London, on 29 October 1618 record that the head was placed in a red bag, and that it and his body, wrapped in his nightgown, were taken away in a mourning coach by his widow. While the body of the soldier, poet, explorer and courtier is believed to have been buried in St Margaret’s Church in Westminster, the subsequent whereabouts of his head are less certain, according to historians. One biographer claimed his widow, Elizabeth, formerly Bess Throckmorton, a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth I, had the head preserved in a case, while other accounts claim she kept it in a bag until her death at West Horsley Place, where she lived with her son Carew Raleigh and his family.Mark Wallis, co-director of Past Pleasures costumed historical interpretation company, who inspected the bag at the manor this month, said: “It’s clearly a bag of the period. Whether it held the mummified head, I couldn’t say. But that Lady Raleigh lived there means that it’s much more likely than it would be otherwise. “If it did hold the head it would have been when it was mummified, and not covered in blood and gore. I doubt this was the bag that Lady Raleigh took away from Whitehall where he’d been executed.”The Mary Roxburghe Trust, which manages the manor, is commissioning further analysis of the bag, according to director Peter Pearce.But historian Anna Beer, author of Patriot or Traitor: The Life and Death of Sir Walter Ralegh, cast doubt on the discovery, which she likened to other posthumous myths about Raleigh – such as those wrongly crediting him with introducing the potato to Britain and placing his cloak over a puddle for Queen Elizabeth. “It’s almost definitely not the bag,” she said. “Almost every source on Raleigh’s execution has wonderful detail of the full horror of it, and that Lady Raleigh took his head away in a red leather bag.”Although Beer said the widow might have used the mummified head as a visual aid to rehabilitate her husband’s reputation, she had not come across “any eyewitness account from the time of when Lady Raleigh whipped out her husband’s head”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f6aa2ae03dc6b6c6f17c462e3ba0ff9bf28931/0_21_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d2797f88b2d55fb56e7e4a6b9e539c","title":"the forgotten cinemas of baltimore in pictures","story":"Since the 1890s, the city in Maryland has been home to more than 240 cinemas and while many of these buildings have survived, only a few of them still show films.

Shopping done. Oven on. Camera primed. Notebooks at the ready. We then sit down to that first meal. There might be mushrooms on toast, Cumberland sausages from Mr Godfrey or cheese sandwiches, their filling dripping out on to the grill, sending out a ribbon of savoury smoke to set off the fire alarm.There is the inevitable request for ketchup. Sometimes we have a bottle of commercial stuff, other times we make our own. A sweet-sharp-spicy dollop, thick enough to need help out of its bottle, but soft enough to stick to whatever is dipped in it – a chewy crust the tip of a glossy sausage. The balance is achieved by a careful juggling of the sugar and some form of acidity. The sweetness can come from brown sugar, honey or from the fresh ingredients themselves, and the acidity from various forms of vinegar. The essential spicing could include mustard, ginger or chilli.This week there was horseradish-hot beetroot ketchup for sausage sandwiches, but we made another, too, a silky, ochre dip with bananas and ginger that was destined for grilled fish, but would have been just as welcome for a massaman curry or a bowl of steamed white rice.A lump of cheese, broken off and dipped sleepily into the ketchup at midnight isn’t too shabby a ritual either.A ketchup that is good with beef, duck, pork but also with cheese.

Place a piece of kitchen foil in a large roasting tin. Wash the beetroot and trim their stems, taking care not to puncture the skin. Add the thyme sprigs, water and 2 tbsp of the oil, then loosely scrunch the edges of the foil to make a parcel. Bake for 45 minutes until the beetroot is just showing signs of tenderness.Peel and roughly chop the onion and garlic and mix with the remaining oil. When the beetroot has been cooking for 45 minutes, add the onion and garlic mixture to the roasting tin around the foil parcel and return to the oven. Continue cooking for a further 40 minutes or until the beetroot is tender and the onion mixture is sweet and caramelised.Unwrap the beetroot, let it cool briefly, then peel off the skin by rubbing with your thumb. Put it into a processor or blender with the onion-mixture vinegars, a generous seasoning of salt and the horseradish, added to taste, if you like. Check the seasoning for vinegar. Process to a coarse purée. The ketchup will keep in a sealed jar for up to a week in the fridge.To cook the chops, put the peppercorns and salt in a mortar.

He scored a beautiful goal. He’s a very good technical player. He’s improving very much in the physical condition and the defensive understanding. He’s complete now.”Sarri’s Burnley counterpart is held in such high regard in this part of the East Lancashire that a local pub has changed its name in his honour. Just down the road from Turf Moor, the Princess Royal has become the Royal Dyche and its patrons would surely have been cheered by the home team’s initially ferocious tempo.When Kepa Arrizabalaga flapped at a couple of Robbie Brady crosses in the early afternoon sunshine Dyche’s ultra aggressive tactics looked to be paying idends. Chelsea appeared rattled, Sarri cut a pensive technical-area figure and those long diagonal balls which kept arrowing through the bluest of skies stretched David Luiz to the limit.Then the visitors began pulling themselves together and, as if anxious to issue a reminder that they are far from a one-man team, started showing precisely how good they could be in the injured Eden Hazard’s absence.By the time Joe Hart did very well to palm away an Álvaro Morata header, Chelsea were settling into a convincingly cohesive pass ’n move groove. Within minutes of Willian hitting a post, Sarri’s side were ahead as Hart proved powerless to repel Morata’s right-foot shot unleashed in the wake of Barkley’s spendid through pass.As a Morata shot whizzed marginally wide of a post, the rugged moorland beyond Burnley’s terraced streets turned increasingly clouded. It seemed a metaphor for their team’s afternoon.Turf Moor’s collective mood was hardly improved by Morata’s penchant for falling over at the most fleeting of brush contact. Otherwise, the Chelsea striker played very well but how locals booed as Morata collapsed in the face of a strong but decent looking James Tarkowski tackle and immediately demanded a penalty. Un-amused Tarkowski and Matthew Lowton immediately squared up to him.Craig Pawson promptly booked Morata and Tarkowski and the referee was soon reaching for his yellow card once more as Willian was sanctioned for a comically blatant e.Perhaps channelling mounting annoyance, Burnley upped their concentration levels and began closing Chelsea down rather more assiduously. Albeit briefly, they succeeded in turning the game scrappy.Unfortunately for Dyche, Jorginho and, in particular, N’Golo Kanté responded as if deeply insulted. This reaction saw the two enforcers seize an iron grip on midfield and, having done so, the impressive Kanté cued up Barkley for an immaculately struck goal, shot left-footed from 22 yards. Granted it helped that Burnley’s defence stood off but it was a stunning finish.On this evidence the £15m Chelsea invested in Barkley looks a bargain. It was an impression intensified as he created the third goal, his delivery prefacing Willian cutting in from the left, shifting the ball on to his right foot and sending a shot curving imperiously beyond Hart from just outside the area.When the substitute Ruben Loftus-Cheek extended his left foot and registered a stoppage-time fourth the contest was long since over. “Chelsea punished us,” Dyche said. “Their technical quality made it very difficult. They’re in unbelievable form.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec6e14d3325ab0aed94cd07686b069ef1bb86413/0_47_3308_1986/master/3308.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eab5249d2f61ee24b2f1fc48ec5185ec","title":"barcelona v real madrid el clasico live","story":"Let’s talk about Barcelona for a moment, who have had a fantastic few days. They played really well against a compliant Inter, and started today in the proper manner, hung in there when Madrid got excited, then displayed a total absence of ruth in kicking them when they down. Arthur and Lenglet have rejuvenated a midfield and defence that was looking tired towards the end of last season, Suarez looks fitter than for ages,, when you have Messi you can win any game, and 4-3-3 suits them better than 4-4-2. Which is to say that it’ll take a phenomenal effort to stop them domestically, they’ve a really good chance in Europe, and Ernesto Valverde is settling in nicely.I suppose Madrid can look on the bright side: how many would it have been had Messi been fit? “Just use manotazo!” emails Henry Carter. “Which means five goals!”I suppose we need a terrible pun forced into that, though - Madridtazo Manotarez Manotagui. I am in so far over my head and so far out of my depth I’ve just changed my name to Julen here’s Adolfo J. Bengoechea‏: “‘Anotar o Marcar” in the context of sports specifically futbol (soccer) is understood as to score. So no worries we understood. Now there are some people that think that their version or point of view is the only one. Don’t pay attention to that.”“When Lopetegui goes, could he please take Benzema with him?” asks Gene Salorio. “The blame for this situation really is on Perez, who again is managing a delusional transfer policy.”The problem for Madrid is that their main currency is prestige which, in the end, cannot compete with sovereign wealth. It can work long-term, but at Madrid nothing can stop the time because time is illmatic, so they may need to take some pain until Asensio, Ceballos and pals are ready. And even if they’d bought a centre-forward, you can’t lose Ronaldo and just get on with things - if you could, he wouldn’t be as good as he is. “You’re good Daniel, it’s perfectly fine to say ‘anotar’,” advises Ben Simmons. “Stick it in, score a goal, notch one, marcar, anotar, meterlo, there’s as many ways to say it as there were goals today. My personal favourite is ‘golear”, which is ‘to thrash’.” Back to the important business of the day, here’s Graeme Thorn: ‘In highlights I’ve seen of the Mexico 1970 World Cup, the captions used ‘Anotado’” to mean scorer, so I’m guessing it might be a EuropeanCentral American Spanish difference between ‘marcar’ and ‘anotar’.”So that’s that one cleared up, then. Perfect. Ok, I suppose we should have a go. Barcelona are quite good, Madrid are a mess, and will surely be seeking a new manager from right about now. The thing is, when you have as many good players as Madrid do, you can produce decent passages as they did: the test is when it gets on top, which it did in the first half and after the third goal. On both occasions, they had absolutely nothing. And for that they earned their kicking, despite having the good grace to perform for 20 minutes or so. That might be Julen Lopetegui’s fault in many aspects, but he had absolutely nothing to do with the inability of repeat European champions to maintain their disci0line and dignity.What words can elucidate those above? 90+1 min What a strange, absurd ridiculous game this is - both generally and specifically. As I ponder that, Benzema drags wide of goal but back to the point, Madrid have actually played quite well for a bit here, but the sense is still of one side on the way up and the other on the way down, which is how you get the defensive collapse we’re witnessing. it reminds me a bit of the 6-1 Manchester derby, though United were down to 10 men and chasing the game, rather than giving up on it. 90 min There’ll be two added minutes. 90 min AND HERE COME BARCA AGAIN! MADRID HAVE FALLEN APART! Sergi Roberto again goes down the right, he clips over a cross, and again Suarez takes it from behind him ... but this time Courtois parries! Barca get bored of possession and find Dembele, who nips inside then outside, sending Nacho for nachos before standing up a cross to the far post where Vidal nods home and celebrates like a meshuggener. This is now one of the great humiliations, where it’s actually sort of a close game but sort of actually not and, well. Which is to say WHAT IS GOING ON?87 min More humiliation as Barca knock it about and the crowd cheer-laugh. Football is beautiful. 86 min “Ahem, that should be ‘tienes que marcar’,” advises Kurt Stengel. “Anotar is to sum up, to annotate.”I’m afriad my Spanish is only as good as Google Translate’s. 85 min How many can Barcelona now score? They replace Arthur with Vidal.Madrid have disintegrated, it’s a hat-trick for Luis Suarez, and what a finish he delivers! But not before, in a moment to savour for everyone who loves the joy of humiliation that is what football is all about, Sergio Ramos chests down, dithers, and is robbed by the excellent Sergi Roberto. He slides through a pass for Suarez, who draws the keeper - it’s a pretty good likeness too - then beardsleys a finish over him as he goes down. I think this might be over, and Julen Lopetgui, who just four months ago was manager of Spain and Real Madrid, is now struggling for anything. Suarez, meanwhile, revels a t-shirt to celebrate the birth of his new son, Lautaro earlier in the week. Disgracefully, he wasn’t booked - what’s become of the game we love so?82 min Off goes Marcelo, replaced by Mariano. 81 min More fantastic new for Madrid: Marcelo tries a backheel and diddles his hamstring.80 min Assuming Madrid lose today, that’s five defeats in seven, with their only win coming over Plzen. They’re ninth in the league, and it’s very hard to see how the manager is getting away with that, though they’ve been quite good since half-time. 78 min “When visiting Los Angeles, be sure to make time to take in the La Brea Tar Pits,” tweets Whitliño. “Of course, ‘la brea” is ‘the tar’ en Español, which means that I would advise you not to miss an opportunity to visit the The Tar Tar Pits...”Lopetgui might just be visiting the ta-ta pits later today. 78 min Change for Madrid: Asensio replaces Bale. 77 min Suarez has a shy at one of Nacho’s angles, misses, stamps on his other calf, drags a leg over him as they fall, and is booked. Dembele floats through midfield and finds Sergi Roberto, who digs out a solid cross to Suarez only a few yards away he contorts brilliantly to cushion, crash and guide a header past Courtois at the near post with ludicrous, mortifying, affirming ease. 75 min Dembele could be such a player if he can harness his easy brilliance. 74 min Another change for Barca, Dembele replacing Coutinho. 73 min Vazquez loses it to Alba, but Isco can’t manage to get a hold of it when the ball comes across and Barca break, Semedo leading the charge. But he can’t find Sergi Roberto, and the chances goes. 70 min Suarez spreads to Sergi Roberto, but he can’t take the ball at a helpful angle so that when it comes back inside the chance to do something good with it has gone, and Suarez gives it away cheaply.69 min Semedo replaces Rafinfa Barca are sort of protecting their lead, except Semedo has plenty to offer going forward. 68 min Tienes que anotar! Ye’ve gottae score! Madrid move the ball out quickly for Vazquez, whose cross is brilliant, early, swerving and precise ... Benzema is there, but can’t quite get over it, and the ball goes over the top. I think we might see a goal or two more here. 66 min Just looking at that Marcelo goal and wondering where he stands in the all-time lost of left-backs. I know there’s a recency bias, but it’s hard not to see him on the level of Maldini and Roberto Carlos, not as a defender but according to his overall contribution to a team. 64 min For the first time in the match, both sides are at it, Busquets finding that switch to Coutinho, who crosses quickly and gently for Jodi Alba, who turns it goalwards on the volley, but Nacho is there to block. The corner comes to nowt. 63 min Rafinha decides to seek attention outside his own box and Bale robs him, finding Kroos, whose through pass is taken by Isco ... but his touch isn’t up to it. And yes, i feel better about myself typing those words, as should you reading them, which why I’m waiting until this point to tell you that he was offside. 61 min But have a look! A clip over the top from Rakitic sees Sergi Roberto absolutely bousting to the far post where, on the stretch, he volleys a ball back for Suarez, who somehow, on the charge, brings a foot up from behind him to hip level and crashes against the post with the outside of his boot! Fantastic play, and what a half this is!

It might not be the most clear cut penalty but it was a legitimate foul. Alex Scott explains that Xhaka is clumsy on the penalty, so I am being proven right on the pen. I am claiming it. Milivojevic showed some bottle today.“I think at least we deserved a point,” he told Sky Sports.“I didn’t have doubts but you feel more pressure after last week when I missed. “I think I decided good, I put good power through the ball. These two goals I dedicate to my teammates.”Andrew also asks: “Will, but it is cheating, isn’t it? Let’s call it what it is.”It’s professional football, you do what you can within the law. Xhaka will get his plaudits for his free-kick, which was superbly struck. Hennessey didn’t seem to anticipate it coming his way as it flew into the top corner. We are probably going to have to talk a lot about Zaha’s efforts in the box. Xhaka was static when Zaha went past him, fully knowledge that making contact with the makeshift left-back would give him the chance of a penalty. In the top level of the game, where small margins matter, I think it is pretty clever and was a penalty. Crystal Palace get their first goals at home to earn a point and Arsenal end their winning run in an entertaining game at Selhurst Park.Milivojevic showed his courage to step up and score the opener from the spot after last week’s vital penalty miss at Everton. Arsenal only played in stages and did not deserve a win here, if we’re all being honest and the second penalty allowed Palace to collect a fully merited point.Will asks about Zaha being “clever”: “Is it though Will? It’s cheating pure and simple - will he get a ban? Doubt it.” There is a leg there to go over, he makes contact and a penalty can be argued. He won the penalty, so he has done it well. 90+2 min: Xhaka lines up a free-kick form 30 yards but he fires it well over the bar. 90+1 min: Emery gets the ball back into play as he urges his players forward. Torreira shows similar determination to get the ball back from Van Aanholt before being fouled by Puncheon.89 min: Xhaka decides to show his right foot works by cutting in from the left to curl in a lovely cross which an unmarked Ramsey dips under and the ball just calmly bounces into Hennessey’s waiting arms.87 min: Van Aanholt lines up a shot from 25 yards, which he drags wide. I think it hit Mustafi but the referee does not think it did and does not award a corner. Puncheon on for Kouyate here. 85 min: Zaha knows what he is doing in those positions, doesn’t he? He has had a tough day against a number of Arsenal defenders who have been pretty physical with him. He knows how to win a penalty and that was a prime example of seeing the leg stuck out and going over it. Clever, really.The Palace skipper smashes the ball just a few inches above Leno’s left hand as he es to his right to level the scores. 82 min: Meyer attempts an overhead kick but misses the ball, allowing Arsenal to clear and instigate a counterattack, which breaks down in the Palace box.The Palace run down the other end, with Zaha being taken down by Xhaka in the box for another penalty. He bought that one, I think. 80 min: Finally Lichtsteiner goes into the book. Naturally, it is for a late foul on Zaha. The Swiss defender was never going to catch Zaha there and just took him down around the ankles to make sure he didn’t get past him. The free-kick comes to nothing after Van-Aanholt smashes a shot out for a throw-in. Arsenal try to claim it was a free-kick in a cheeky, time-wasting fashion. Nice try, lads.78 min: Appeals for handball after Wan-Bissaka gets round the back and sends in a cross which hit Holding right in the hip. Good call from the officials. Aubameyang exits the pitch, through the pouring rain, to be replaced by Ramsey.76 min: Zaha is taken down by Torreira and then has a few verbals with Martin Atkinson who points out it merits nothing more than a foul. Lichtsteiner is then called for a late challenge on Meyer but is once again not booked.74 min: Sorloth puts Mustafi under pressure, which is a wise thing to do, forcing him to play it back to Leno, who clears up field.Down the other end, Iwobi fires in a shot from 20 yards, which is deflected just wide of goal for a corner. Duncan has been in touch: “I’d find it very frustrating to play with Zaha. He seems to have a need to stop every time he loses the ball, miskicks, or something else goes wrong, which is often.”Being Jordan Ayew must be pretty frustrating in general.72 min: Things are hotting up at Selhurst Park. The sun is out and the home fans are trying to will their team on for an equaliser. 70 min: Wan-Bissaka’s cross is cleared out to Milivojevic 25 yards out but his volley goes well over the bar. Ben ponders: “Apart from the occasional banger from 25 yards, what exactly is it about Xhaka that gets him into the team every week? I feel like I’m missing a subtlety of his game that only a Wenger or an Emery could understand.”To be fair, he is only playing today as no other left-footed players are available.68 min: Zaha is once again the man causing trouble as he commits a number of defenders inside the box, but his shot is blocked by Lichtsteiner. He then retrieves the loose ball and tees up Meyer but he volleys over from close range.Welbeck comes on for Ozil, who has been very quiet. 66 min: Arsenal are set to bring on their midweek matchwinner, Danny Welbeck, as they look to stretch the Palace defence for the remaining 25 minutes. 64 min: Zaha is unhappy with the treatment from Lichtsteiner, after the Swiss fouled the winger from behind. Zaha squared up to his opponent but things quickly calm down. The resulting free-kick ends up with Meyer inside the box after Arsenal fail to clear but from an acute angle all he can do is hit the outside of the post.Ayew is off, which is a relief. 62 min: A first change for Palace as Meyer comes on for McArthur who really has made no impact today. He should provide a bit more energy to the midfield. Sorloth is also readying himself. 60 min: Arsenal are now looking a bit more relaxed on the ball at Selhurst after manic five minutes or so.

He does well to hook it back from the by-line but none of his team-mates expected him to do so, so nobody profits from his efforts.65 mins: Manchester United take off Rashford, and bring on Romelu Lukaku.64 mins: The atmosphere has turned febrile in the last few minutes, thanks partly to Pogba. Coleman wins a free kick for Everton on the right flank.63 mins: Pogba backs into Gomes, who pushes him in the back. The Frenchman goes down and feigns serious injury, forcing Everton to kick the ball out of play. Everton’s fans boo furiously both then and when the Frenchman promptly stood up.62 mins: Bernard, author of the miss of the match, is the one to go off.60 mins: Lookman looks to be getting ready to come on for Everton, for whom only Richarlison is causing the home defence regular headaches.57 mins: And another chance for the home side! Martial picks out Pogba, whose first touch is excellent, and whose second sends the ball arrowing low and hard towards the near post, where Pickford saves!54 mins: Now Rashford is played through, but his first touch takes him wide and his shot hits Pickford’s foot!51 mins: What a miss from Bernard! Incredible scenes! He’s played in by Richarlison, with Walcott free to his right. Instead of giving his team-mate a tap-in he jinks to his left and goes past De Gea, opening up the goal but giving him a less helpful angle, and his shot hits the side netting!That’s a wonderful goal! Pogba picks it up 25 yards out, hints at a shot and then passes to Martial to his left, whose first-time shot from the 18-yard line curls past Pickford and in at the far post!48 mins: Pogba turns nicely inside the penalty area and jinks his way goalwards, past Coleman and Sigurdsson, but the ball bobbles through to Pickford.47 mins: Richarlison runs to the edge of the area and curls a shot towards the near post, which De Gea anticipates and saves well.The players are back out and ready for more action!Everton have had a couple of chances, and with Richarlison and Walcott they have enough pace to trouble United’s defence. They could do with sending their efforts on goal somewhere other than straight at De Gea, mind.45+3 mins: And that is half-time. United have been the better side and deservedly lead, though if the referee had x-ray vision and slow-motion eyes he probably wouldn’t have given them their penalty.45+1 mins: Walcott has a shot from an absurdly unlikely angle, with two team-mates much better placed to his left. It’s at De Gea, who turns it behind, and nothing comes from the corner.45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there will be some two minutes.44 mins: Walcott cuts in from the right and then scuffs a low shot at De Gea from 20 yards.43 mins: Matic is booked for a 15-yard long-term slow-motion foul on Sigurdsson.41 mins: And here’s the crucial view of the penalty incident:40 mins: That run-up in full:38 mins: Chance for Everton! Coleman crosses from the right, and Sigurdsson, from a couple of yards inside the area, heads at De Gea.36 mins: Young’s sliding challenge on Digne is an absolute beauty. He absolutely screams into the ball, leaving the Frenchman, who had no idea that a challenge was coming, on the ground and utterly bewildered. The ball ended up out of play, so United didn’t really benefit, but that was great.35 mins: Fred leathers a shot well wide. “Pogba’s penalty sums up why he annoys the hell out of me,” rages Kevin Wilson. “He can’t just do what is simple and belt it into a corner. He has to humiliate his opponent. It’s the same when he gets the ball anywhere on the pitch. He has to chump a couple of players even where there is no advantage in doing so. He is the worst kind of show pony.”35 mins: Everything for Manchester United is coming down the left, where Martial is proving an absolute nightmare for Everton’s defence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeff7d0b015f179d37c90a1fdd2c6ddf3f8420dd/1634_0_7772_4664/master/7772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=638888509821524ca50360a2b2c00dbc","title":"this boys life the fabulous return of boy george","story":"His outrageous fashion and controversial behaviour have been making headlines for decades. Now he’s making music againOi,” shouts Boy George, from the top of the stairs, his voice strident south London. “Are you coming up then?” The Observer’s interview with the 57-year-old frontman of Culture Club does not, it’s fair to say, get off to a great start. I’d imagined that he might want a few minutes to change his clothes after the photo shoot. He, conversely, feels there is nothing remotely incongruous about sitting down for a cup of tea wearing a capacious black overcoat and customised domed hat made from rabbit-fur felt.And there’s a certain edge to our opening exchanges. I call him “theatrical” and he shudders just a little at the description. “I’m not particularly theatrical,” he replies. “Even though my mum used to call me that when I was a kid. She used to say: ‘He’s theatrical, highly strung.’ But I’m not a smell-of-the-greasepaint person, I don’t come alive on stage, I’m not one of these…” he gasps, eyes twinkle. “‘The crowd!’ As much as I love it.”We both look at what he’s wearing, rings of makeup around his quick, green eyes and a smile starts to play on his lips. “I always say to people: I’m not interested in fashion, I’m interested in creating things,” he goes on. “I’m not interested in what everyone else is wearing or how much something costs. If you go out head-to-toe in Gucci that’s much more theatrical than what I do. It’s saying: ‘Look how rich I am. I can’t afford to live anywhere, but I’ve got head-to-toe Gucci!’ I’m just as likely to go into an Oxfam shop on the Finchley Road and I’ve always avoided wearing people’s names on my clothes. That’s just never appealed to me. Maybe if I’m in bed I might wear some Calvin Klein briefs...”Then the famous dirty cackle: “But I’d want to make my own ones with ‘Calvin Decline’ on them. Something with humour.”And that’s the thing about Boy George: he’s not the type to stay in a mood for long. He may contest the word theatrical but there is no question that he is a born entertainer. He can’t help himself. That much should have been clear when he appeared in a celestial white tunic on Top of the Pops in 1982, aged 21, his face pale and angular, his hair tied with ribbons, singing, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me? It’s certainly the case 35 years later, sitting in a studio in north London. He’s older and wiser, but he’s not lost the capacity to provoke and shock, and he’s still convinced that he has something to contribute to the musical zeitgeist.Life, Culture Club’s first new album for 19 years, was released this week. It will be followed in November by a stadium tour across the UK. It is, essentially, a third coming for the band. The first incarnation lasted from 1981 to 1986, a fertile period that saw the four-piece – George, Roy Hay (guitar), Mikey Craig (bass) and Jon Moss (drums) – produce four albums and sell 150m records worldwide. They won a Grammy in 1984 for best new artist, multiple Brit Awards and, for many people, defined an era with their erse, gender-fluid aesthetic. They reunited briefly in the late 1990s for another album, Don’t Mind If I Do, but there’s an intent this time round that somehow feels different, more pure.“With Culture Club getting back together, I was always saying: ‘I’m not doing this unless we’re making a new record,’” George says. “I’m not interested in nostalgia. Nostalgia, it’s like purgatory to be constantly doing the same thing over and over. And obviously the new music has to be strong and it has to stand up against those classic songs and I think we’re there. I’m not embarrassed about doing it live, I don’t apologise or even say it’s a new song.”Really? He still has the drive and ambition to write songs as iconic as Karma Chameleon, Victims and It’s a Miracle?“Oh, this is much better,” George insists, “because I don’t even know who that person was. I look at myself 20 years ago, and I’m like: ‘I love the way you look, but what are you going on about?’”Life is a grand title, but certainly there isn’t much that George hasn’t experienced in his. Born George O’Dowd in 1961 in Bexley, he grew up in south London with his Irish Catholic parents, Gerry and Dinah, and his five siblings (four brothers, one sister). George came along second and he thinks now that this “middle-child syndrome” might explain a lot. “I’ve never felt at home in any world,” he says. “I’ve always felt like an outsider. Even within the groups that I was meant to be part of: gay culture, pop music… I don’t know why that is, but I’ve met a lot of middle children and they all feel pretty much like I do. Left to their own devices. I was a great wanderer when I was a child, I’d wander off on my own, miles and miles and miles. Happily occupy myself doing whatever. And I’m a bit like that now.”An early obsession with David Bowie led, as a teenager, into a disparate, catholic interest in just about everything. “Gladys Knight, the Stylistics, then mixed in with glam rock, punk rock and electro,” says George. “The 1970s was just the decade that kept giving, it was just the maddest decade ever. And I think probably my favourite decade.”George began to experiment with his look, a process that remains ongoing. “When I think about me as a 16-year-old walking around London dressed as a nun, or whatever I was wearing, running the gauntlet of people wanting to beat me up…” he remembers, smiling. “Everybody wanted to beat you up. It was like teddy boys, casuals, reggae kids, everybody wanted to give you a punch, everybody. And I’m not saying that’s a good thing, but people nowadays are so ready to get upset about eeeeeeverything. I was describing this coat I was wearing earlier as the ‘Mincing Nellie coat’. And everyone was like” – he mimes appalled – “‘You can’t say Mincing Nellie!’” He waves his hand: “I’m talking about myself, I can say whatever I want. It’s that weird fear of having an opinion. I call it ‘muted by the net’.”Success with Culture Club was instant, unstoppable. “Fame is a funny beast, because no one really understands it,” he says. “It’s a little bit like love, a little bit like God. I remember in 1982, when I was doing the classic, ‘I’ll never change, I’ll always be me,’ and this friend of mine said: ‘Everyone will treat you differently.’ So you go through this period of losing the plot and sometimes that suits people. Some people really get into it and they like it. And other people go: ‘Oh no!’ I guess I was one of the second lot, I just went: ‘Not for me.’”“Losing the plot” is certainly one way of describing it. When Culture Club was starting out, George was the straight-edged one: he rarely drank, didn’t smoke or do drugs. But, by the mid-1980s, George was catching up fast. There were external factors: the band’s third album failed to reach the heights of the first two he was also having a secret and often combustible love affair with Moss, the band’s drummer, who didn’t identify as gay. George once recalled that when he met Moss’s mother, “I ended up having to eat with the servants in the kitchen.” He embarked on near-comical spending sprees (68 pairs of Calvin Klein underpants, 40 undershirts) and jumped quickly from marijuana to cocaine to heroin.Culture Club split, but it took something much worse for George to reform. In 2006, he pleaded guilty in New York of falsely reporting a burglary he was given a fine and, famously, did street cleaning as part of his community service. Then, back in London in 2009, he was sentenced to 15 months’ imprisonment for the false imprisonment of Audun Carlsen, a model and escort, at one point handcuffing him to a wall. George served four months and has not touched drink or drugs in almost a decade since.“In terms of my own recovery, obviously I’m very proud of that, but I don’t spend a lot of time thinking about it,” he says. “I know I’ll never drink or take drugs again, as much as I can know it. When I got clean, I remember calling my mum and saying: ‘I’m so awful.’ And she was like” – he adopts a strong Irish accent – “‘Just stay clean. You don’t have to apologise.’ So just for my mum more than anything.”Why did George feel he had to apologise? “I’d been awful ha ha,” he shoots back. “I mean, please! Don’t you read the papers?” Was prison a shock then? “Yeah, you’re just looking for a headline,” he replies, wearily. “Move on! It’s like so long ago! I honestly really, really truthfully don’t think about that period of my life very much. Because it’s really unpleasant. And, actually, what I learned from that period was to shut up. If you knew me before then, I had no off button. And going through that whole experience really taught me to protect myself and to just be a little bit more selective about what I talk about.“People talk to me about my past like it didn’t happen to me,” he goes on. “Ha ha, like it wasn’t the most harrowing thing that could have happened to a human being! I went through it! Why would I want to talk about it? It is a mad one because people always think like, ‘Oh, you’re hiding something.’ The only thing I’m hiding is the truth.”George may be reluctant to dwell on that part of his life, but it’s not hard to make a connection to the new material. One song on the record is called Different Man on Life, the title track, he sings: “I know I’m crazy but just a little sane  I get to take this ride again.”“Well, I’ve had lots of new goes, ha ha,” he says. “I’m the Renaissance king. But there’s a point where you grow up and you go, ‘Oh my God, I do this for a living. People are so nice to me! What have I done to deserve this?’”And he’s right to be proud of the new material. There can be something heart-sinking about a 1980s revival, but Culture Club has returned with big, catchy songs full of soul. George’s voice is less ethereal these days, but remains expressive and invigorating. “Every record on the radio sounds the same,” he sighs. “That’s maybe why our album sounds so good, because it’s songs! Songs with a beginning and an end and there’s a context and it’s about something. I think there’s going to be a return to bands. Things are going to get noisy again.”Personally, George seems in a good place these days. He spent much of the past two years in Australia, where he was a judge on The Voice. But for now, he’s back in the UK: “London is my home, I feel most sane when I’m here.” He has a small record label called BGP and is starting to write with and promote other artists. He doesn’t have a partner right now, but he’s not complaining. “No, young free and single,” he says. And then a long pause: “Even if I did I wouldn’t tell you, ha ha ha.”George is learning lessons, too, and when it’s time to go he wants to impart two of them. First: “Little, mundane things are what make you truly happy. It’s never like getting a Grammy. Yes, of course those things are beautiful, but it’s always being on holiday in Margate with your family. Just mad little things.” And second? “I’ve been thinking a lot about: what’s my purpose? I’m not quite there yet, but I’m thinking it’s to put beautiful things into the world.”He ponders that notion for a moment, hard-earned from 57 turbulent years on the planet. “That’s quite a good purpose,” he decides.Boy George and Culture Club’s album, Life, is out now. The Life Tour will visit 11 cities across the UK, starting on 9 November in Nottingham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620fbcd0d6580844c89422ba83e61e988ec338ab/28_0_3214_1928/master/3214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7570c1e2c1d7b3dfb4bdcb9da51b6f1c","title":"bbc bosses call for radio rethink ahead of bbc sounds launch","story":"The app will incorporate livestreams, catchup services, music mixes and podcastsThe BBC’s director of radio is worried. Younger audiences are listening to more audio then ever before. They understand the captive quality of spoken-word stories. They’re more likely to listen to challenging, interesting podcasts on their commute to work or while in the car. They want to hear new music, tailored to their interests. The problem is they don’t necessarily need to go to the BBC to get what they want.“If we don’t do anything over the next 10 years you’ll have a two-speed BBC radio audience,” says James Purnell, the man tasked with turning this around. “People who’d grown up with it and people who didn’t.”On the face of it, BBC Radio is in rude health. It has half the national market, with dozens of stations reaching more than 34 million people a week. Radio 2 alone reaches 15 million listeners a week and for all the criticism of the Today programme (“editorially I think it’s in brilliant shape,” says Purnell), one in nine Britons still tune in to hear John Humphrys and his co-presenters harangue politicians every week.The problem is that ever since the BBC was founded almost a century ago it has been based around an era of broadcasting that was designed towards a comprehensive offering: a shared listening – and then viewing – experience. But just as Netflix upended TV viewing habits, the growth of podcasts and Spotify means listeners increasingly expect their audio content to be personalised to them. Put simply, they no longer need to listen to a playlist or a schedule that doesn’t perfectly suit their needs.“BBC Radio is still incredibly successful, but I don’t think it’s ever faced such competition,” says Bob Shennan, a lifelong BBC employee who now oversees all radio and music output for the corporation, pointing towards the likes of Spotify and Apple’s podcast libraries. “People are listening to things the whole time but the competition for their ears is with a whole host of organisations beyond the commercial radio sector.”With this in mind, the corporation is putting its hope in BBC Sounds, a new app and website that formally launches on Tuesday with a glitzy event at Tate Modern. It will bring radio livestreams, catchup services, music mixes and podcasts together under one roof. Personalised recommendations will push listeners towards content they wouldn’t necessarily have listened to – a Radio 3 documentary or a specially commissioned podcast such as the Today programme spin-off, Beyond Today – for instance. BBC radio presenters will produce music mixes – although, unlike on Spotify, listeners will not be able to skip inidual tracks.Convincing people to break their existing habits and put their trust in a BBC-only app will not be easy. Spotify has started including a large number of podcasts – including BBC material – directly in its app and a growing number of people use voice assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa to listen to the radio. Although there is the prospect of commercial radio being added later, industry voices have raised concerns that the app is a solution in search of a non-existent problem.“The BBC produces great audio and they’ve got the marketing muscle to use BBC Sounds to introduce podcast-listening to the large numbers of people who haven’t done that yet,” says Matt Deegan, a consultant who writes about the radio industry.He says the corporation faces a challenge to make a compelling app while “competing with a full catalogue of the world’s audio on Apple Podcasts and Spotify” and convince listeners to use it for more than just livestreaming their favourite radio stations.The man tasked with making this work is Jason Phipps, a former  employee who joined as the corporation’s first commissioning editor for podcasts earlier this year. He says there’s a need to reconsider the entire tone of how BBC tells stories, shifting away from rigid formality if it wants to attract the precious under-35 audience: “It has to be a warmer, more story-led journey. You need to report the very personal experience of it. “The very best stories are fundamentally anchored around the personal experience. You’re trying to find the human in the machine. Journalists have a process but younger audiences can find that very cold and want to access the actual response of human beings. They really want to understand the heart of the story.”One of the UK’s most popular podcasts My Dad Wrote a Porno “wouldn’t have been commissioned anywhere in the past” because it is “too outlandish”, Phipps argues.“We need more brash, funny, intelligent podcasts,” he says, saying the format’s intimacy is the reason why podcasts about “sex, relationships and erotic imaginations” have done so well. “It’s a perfect place to have uncomfortable conversations.”Until recently the BBC was banned from creating online-only podcasts for competition reasons, meaning it is now “making up for lost time”, Shennan says. To this end a “few million pounds” a year will be given to commission podcasts purely for an online audience.Purnell, a former Labour cabinet minister, says the corporation is committing to putting challenging voices on its radio and podcast output. “You have to win the case for free speech over and over again,” he says. “For the last few generations people have taken it for granted. It’s absolutely core to us to present everyone with that wide range of views. That doesn’t mean you have to suspend your judgement.”Shennan compares the leap into on-demand audio and podcasting to previous decisions to invest in television during the 1950s and the internet in the 1990s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d61efeff56e2a21897721fe049dbab54c01321aa/0_70_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78fa2d5ab1c0dc160d517717ccb7960c","title":"photojournalist steve mccurry a life in pictures","story":"A new book, Steve McCurry: A Life in Pictures, compiled by the photographer’s sister Bonnie McCurry, captures his iconic images, from his early work in the US to his journey into Afghanistan hidden among the mujahideen, coverage of the 1991 Gulf war and 911, and more recent work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3259825bc65bc21386a7d2370247756b6f1c3c77/0_4_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b793270176c7fd13e2ebca603e96b44","title":"end game how australian preppers are bugging out and hunkering down","story":"As global anxiety takes hold, an increasing number of people are preparing for the worst-case scenario by learning survival skills and stockpiling suppliesEarlier this year the hands of the Doomsday Clock moved to two minutes to midnight, as atomic scientists announced that the world is closer to annihilation than it has been in decades. Is it any wonder, then, that the worldwide phenomenon of prepping, in all its camouflaged, gun-toting, canned-food-hoarding glory, is spreading as global anxiety about everything from thermonuclear war to climate change takes hold.When we think about the worst case scenarios that could play out on the planet, most of us fit somewhere on the sliding scale from wilful ignorance through sensible precaution to paranoia. Yet for some, the zeitgeist is trending towards a bleak future.And while Australians differ from the god-fearing libertarianism that keeps its finger on the trigger in the hinterlands of the US we have our own preppers who are ready to bug out, hunker down and skill up ready to face the unthinkable.Take IT worker Jim Greer from Rockingham, Western Australia who expects the world to fall apart sometime soon. He is not sure exactly when but he has an 8-tonne truck prepped and ready to go at a moment’s notice.“If something happens, I think there will be far too many people standing around with their jaws on the ground,” he says.As a child, Greer learned to tie clove hitches and reef knots with the Scouts as an adult he served in the navy. The motto Be Prepared is in his blood, and he’s been gathering survivalist skills for many years.To better understand how to live off the land, he spent time with Aboriginal people who live traditionally. The Anangu Luritja people of Central Australia taught him how to make weapons and hunt, and Greer can now make an Indigenous style traditional spear.And in his travels, Greer has located the holy grail of prepping: a “bug out” location that can sustain him when *TSHTF – prepper lingo for when the shit hits the fan – complete with a 10,000 year-old stream.“Even if there was nuclear radiation, the spring is underground and would still be safe. There is also plenty of wildlife that would hang around it and provide food,” he says.“I could effectively just walk out to the bush and be ok. I can build a house from the ground up. I can do my own mechanics. I can cook and clean. I have trained myself to be able to cope with almost anything,” he says.Greer has a palpable certainty that some kind of shit is going to hit some kind of fan and he believes his prepping is a common sense reaction to that. He believes the threats could come from AI (artificial intelligence), economic collapse, an atomic bomb or even an EMP (electro magnetic pulse) – and the resulting chaos will see him hit the road to get out of the city.“The truck holds enough fuel that I could get 1,200kms away,” he says. “I have a handful of friends that have also been prepping for a while and they know exactly where I am going.”Greer sees complacency in people whose worries don’t extend further than a supermarket closing for a few days but that approach is not for him. “Imagine how quickly things would go to shit with two and a half million people not being able to get what they need. There are not enough people prepared but there are certainly more preppers now than five years ago,” he says.He believes prepping is key but having the mental strength to survive is the unknown factor. “It doesn’t matter how many containers of food you have or what you have organised, if you are not mentally ready for it you probably won’t survive either,” he says. “Some people have an instinct to keep going but even preppers could turn around when it all happens and fall in a heap.” However he doesn’t plan to be one of them.Geography teacher Mel from West Perth offers courses in prepping and has been reassuring panicked callers that there are a range of skills that are very useful to have: apocalypse or no apocalypse.“I want to break down that stereotype that all preppers are paranoid. There is a middle ground. A lot of people are living this but they might not want to call themselves preppers,” she says.“They are stockpiling food they are concerned about climate change and they are worried about what would happen if Trump pushed the button. People do want to know what to do and how to survive.”Mel calls herself a “latte prepper” because if she is going down, it will be in style and may include chocolate. Her business Chilli Preppers has been running for about five years, and she hosts courses including food cultivation and preservation, and doomsday prepping.She says many of the skills she teaches are those our grandparents knew but current generations have lost. They knew scarcity and so they grew their own food, preserved it and fixed things themselves. The consumer generation – not so much.Mel doesn’t subscribe to the “every man for himself” philosophy that is a hallmark of many prepper’s Cormac McCarthy-styled nightmare. “My grand plan is that I will build a community around me, rather than think that I will be in a post apocalyptic bunker where I have to do everything. You don’t want to be scared of your neighbours and worry about whether they will take your stuff,” she says.“We all have different skills and in a real life situation, how much better to talk to each other and pool our resources. Society would have to rearrange. We couldn’t all just lock ourselves away and if we did, we wouldn’t last for very long.”She believes there are two main ways of thinking in a an apocalyptic situation: one is to bug out and the other is to hunker down. People who choose to bug out have a location somewhere hidden or remote that they are prepping with equipment and supplies.“I’m not so much of a bug out type of person but I do have family members who have things stored on country properties. I also have my house prepped so that it would last for a few days with supplies of water and food.”At home, Mel has aquaponics and a big vegetable garden. She also has solar panels and solar lights. “If we had to grow food inside, we could. We have tried it and it is hard. Plants are clever and they like real sunlight so until the button is pressed, we won’t move the grow beds inside.”“It may never happen and that will be fantastic. I may never have a house fire but I do have insurance,” she says.Blogger and author Nick Sais from Australian Preppers has seen downloads of his prepping manual jump exponentially week by week.He sees the increasing traffic on his site as a sign of a collective frame of mind. “It is a way to gain some control where the big picture is out of control,” he says.Sais is an electrician who spent a number of years in the army reserve and has always had an interest in survivalism, but over time his hobby has become something more. “I don’t think people understand just how fragile the system is,” he says.Where there used to be occasional forays into the bush with minimal equipment to test his mettle, now there are several buried caches in specific but remote bug out locations on public land. The caches include dried beans, rice, water purification and fire starting devices. “Some people say – well what if you never use it. But it doesn’t cost much and if we do need it, it is there.”He has also taught himself to hunt feral animals using traps and bow and arrow. “Whatever I kill, I will eat, I don’t waste anything. I realised that I had to learn how to, to have any chance of surviving.”“When I was growing up, we went through the cold war. It was a tense time but there wasn’t the feeling that it was going to end in nuclear war but I’m not so sure now,” he says. “With some of the people in power at the moment, you can’t pick the end game. I think we are on the brink of war … whether that is nuclear or boots on the ground, it is not going to be nice.”For Sais, it is a family affair. He and his wife don’t have children but their wider family of nieces and nephews often go out to the bush to learn how to build a shelter and start a fire. It is a fun camping trip but also survival training. His parents also know the bug out locations. Whether they are willing or not to go there in the event of a “situation,” he’s not sure. “We have had conversations,” he says.“Some people want to do whatever it takes to survive the holocaust. You need to ask yourself if you are ready to be in a world that you won’t recognise or would you prefer to go quickly? It is morbid but it is a valid question. I know my wife has turned around at times and said ‘no’, but I think I can.”Sais stresses that it is not all about prepping for the Armageddon. The idea is that if you plan for the worst, and then something small happens, you are good to go. His prepping website and manual gives practical tips for people in rural communities who might be affected by fires or floods, for example.He acknowledges there might be stigma attached to the word “prepper” but stresses it is just about being prepared – whether that is for the Armageddon or just for a flat tyre is up to the inidual.Associate professor and author Mick Broderick, who has a decades-long fascination with atomic-age doomsday scenarios says every generation has worried about the “end times” but acknowledges that we are the first generations to know that a thermonuclear exchange could extinguish most life on the planet.“Before the nuclear age, it was thought that only a wrathful deity or natural force (pandemic, planetary collision etc) would bring about the end of the world,” he says. “But some time in the 1980s, it became clear that there were so many nuclear weapons on the planet that we could literally bring about the end, not only of Homo sapiens but pretty much extinguish most life on earth through a nuclear exchange,” he says.“We live in an era that within 15 minutes notice, nuclear weapons could be crossing the continents bringing about great devastation. Yet we deny this, go about our business, we go on teaching, we drive our cars to work. We repress to the point where we don’t give it any real conscious thought.”Broderick says governments present the idea of survivability based on tropes from the 50s (duck and cover, anyone?) but says any prepper worth his dried beans knows that heading rural is the gold standard of survivability. He explains in a global thermonuclear war, if you are in a city you are probably toast.He says there are some preppers who embrace a fantasy of emerging into a new environment where there will be fewer people and where they will have the necessary skills to be the elite. However that comes from the centuries old idea that the unjust will be smote and the old guard will be swept away in a catastrophe.He also sees a regular clustering of things in popular culture, including Bear Grylls style survivor TV shows on TV and the proliferation of zombie apocalypse movies, ”which lead to peaks and troughs of prepping behaviour. “If you take a step back and look, you can see that there is an underlying yearning that is met by these behaviours,” he says.“Our increasing urbanization has largely removed us from the need to get our hands dirty – yet there is an almost primal desire to understand how things work and to embrace the materiality of things.”Broderick isn’t sure if the doomsday peppers are selfish nutters or if they have a point. “Are they narcissistic or are they just wise? Is there merit in their capacity to project onto scenarios and to plan to survive them? Well that is for others to judge.” Yet for those still on the fence, he points out that things don’t generally work out well for those that fail to heed the signs. You have been warned.

The group are alleged to have tried to leave the London Reign Showclub in the early hours of Saturday without paying their tab. They were stopped from leaving by the nightclub’s security team and detained by police for nine hours before being released, according to the Sun.It is understood that the club dropped the complaint after the bill was settled. The four players involved were named by nfl and CBS Sports as Barry Church, Ronnie Harrison, DJ Hayden and Jarrod Wilson. On its website, the venue is described as “an aerial show club bringing an eclectic mix of Las Vegas and Moulin Rouge to the heart of London’s West End”. It has confetti cannons, a jellyfish tank and a waterfall. On Saturday it was running a “Welcome to Gotham” themed event.VIP tables have a minimum spend of £3,000, while bottles of champagne start at £450 and rise to a 15l nebuchadnezzar bottle for £55,000. According to nfl the players were sent bottles that they believed were on the house, and the disagreement occurred when they were asked to pay.The Jaguars confirmed the players had been detained in a statement on Saturday. “The matter is being resolved and the players are with the team,” the Jaguars said. “Any discipline will be handled internally.”The politan Police said they had been called to the venue on Saturday morning. “Officers attended and spoke with a group of males who had allegedly been attempting to leave the venue without paying a large bill,” said a spokesman. “Four men aged in their 20s were subsequently arrested on suspicion of fraud by false representation and taken to a central London police station for questioning. They were all subsequently released with no further action.”The incident comes during a disappointing season for the Jaguars. They were expected to be a Super Bowl contender but have lost their last three games, and their quarterback, Blake Bortles, was benched last week after a series of mistakes.London has hosted at least one NFL game a year since 2007 as part of the league’s International Series. The Eagles-Jaguars game is the third to be played in London this season, and many believe the series will eventually lead to Britain having its own NFL franchise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd6991eef69d73cd023383273325e2b7e8d5467/0_720_4811_2888/master/4811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b341c6522f18e5fbcd2ee873e2f40b0b","title":"meet the cast of debbie tucker greens ear for eye whats on stage needs to reflect life","story":"As the award-winning writer’s new play opens at the Royal Court, the actors involved talk about breaking boundaries in British theatre and tucker green’s innovative approachBefore the Royal Court theatre’s new play began previewing, the plot and premise were very much kept under wraps. There were no rehearsal shots or publicity campaigns, and no flurry of excitable tweets to whet our appetites and prime us as to what we could expect to see.Some details were revealed: that its writer-director was debbie tucker green (she styles her name in lower case), that its title was ear for eye, (also written in lower case) and that it would have a cast of 16 actors.A terse summary stated that it was “a play about protest and the black body in the UK and US today” and that it would contain “snapshots of some experiences of protest violence versus non-violence, direct action versus demonstrations”.So it was about racism, then? Those who knew refused to be drawn further.The reason for the omertà was tucker green who, like Caryl Churchill, is among those “snow leopard” theatre practitioners who steer clear of explaining their work and insist on letting the drama do all the talking. There was no more information given because, the Royal Court said, tucker green did not want anything else out there before the production opened.The policy of letting the play speak for itself does not appear to have done her any harm, judging by the awards and acclaim she has amassed in theatre as well as television and film screenwriting.Born in London, she worked as a stage manager for a decade before putting on her first play, dirty butterfly, in 2003 at the Soho theatre. Her drama born bad, at the Hampstead theatre, won an Olivier award for most promising newcomer in 2004 and random, a TV adaptation of her play about youth and violence, won a Bafta in 2012. She also wrote the Bafta-nominated film Second Coming (2014), starring Idris Elba.Themes have ranged from modern-day love and sex to marital dysfunction, urban dislocation, knife crime and the human collateral of genocidal violence. Her Royal Court play last year – a profoundly affectionate, passionate devotion to someone (-noun) – picked over the often silent tensions between couples, while her 2011 drama at the same theatre, truth and reconciliation, was made up of vignettes depicting the aftermath of mass violence (in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Rwanda) through inidual stories of suffering.Given the glittering backlist, it is surprising that tucker green is not more of a household name, though she might feel some satisfaction in remaining so below the radar.The point of the artistic silence around ear to eye is to return the thrill of a live performance to theatre audiences, explains Vicky Featherstone, the artistic director of the Royal Court.“We live in a world in which you’ve virtually seen the entire film in the trailer before it’s out. And you’ve seen the aesthetic too. There is no surprise. You come to it with a set of assumptions and the understanding that ‘I’m the kind of person who watches this’.“With debbie’s shows, it’s about experiencing the drama in the room. It goes back to telling stories around a campfire or to Greek theatre.”Theatre critics have enthused about tucker green’s scripts, her ability to “bend” language and infuse her dialogue with a distinctive poetic voice. But in keeping with her low profile, she declined the request to be interviewed about this play or explain the way her scripts come together.In her last big interview with the  in 2005, she spoke of creating her narratives through a kind of bricolage, by beginning with a voice in her head and writing scraps of script until it is pieced together.“I never set out to write plays,” she said. “I was just messing about, writing stuff down and throwing it away or keeping it if it interested me. Then the writing started to get longer. I didn’t know whether it was a poem, the lyrics to a song or a play.”Actors are encouraged not to learn the script before they begin rehearsals and the dialogue comes alive, it seems, when they begin to say it out aloud. Tosin Cole, who stars in the latest Doctor Who series as Ryan, and is in tucker green’s production, says that she has a way of using grammar to provoke certain moods and feelings. “There’s a rhythm and pace to her writing. Everything is very precise in what she does. The punctuation is very, very important. You might see symbols or dashes or hyphens in the way she writes. You have an idea of what it means but you won’t know what it fully means until she explains it and you see what effect it has when you deliver it that way.”Jamal Ajala speaks of being the first deaf actor at the Royal Court as part of tucker green’s drama and how his part evolved: “We had to translate the script to British Sign Language for me and we also had to introduce some BSL into the script. Debbie kept an open mind through all of that. She allowed us to create signs where they were appropriate and change the English a bit.”The other striking feature of this play is its size, in contrast with tucker green’s previous stage works, which have had compact casts. This is a 16-strong ensemble, and some rehearsals were done in smaller groupings that later came together as a whole.Of the full cast, all but one is an actor of colour. Tucker green has been open about wanting to chart black – or at least not singularly white – experience in her work. In 2005, she said: “I’m a black woman. I write black characters. That is part of my landscape.”The theatrical landscape has changed significantly since then, some might argue, with greater parity for actors of colour and a trend for colour-blind casting. Some have even spoken of a watershed moment in recent British theatre, with actors of colour being granted unprecedented opportunities. Does the cast feel that the tide has turned?Cole is optimistic but cautiously so: “There’s a time and a moment and then it goes quiet again. I don’t think it’s consistent enough.“I’m seeing people of my background playing different roles but it’s not perfect. I feel like we’ve had the conversation for a long time. We’re starting to get heard, we’re slowly breaking in and doing things to make this issue not an issue, but we shouldn’t still be talking about this in the next five to 10 years when the next generation starts to come through. They shouldn’t need to have this conversation.”If bigger opportunities are presenting themselves, there is still the question of being typecast. Eric Kofi Abrefa recently had a starring role in Julie, Polly Stenham’s adaptation of Strindberg’s Miss Julie at the National Theatre and is now in tucker green’s play.He makes careful choices regarding roles, he says. “It’s a tricky one because roles come up and you can accept or reject them. I choose to do something where I know what I’m representing. I can’t just take on a role because I need to put some food on the table. As an actor you understand your power comes in what you choose to do… But that’s if you want to wait.”Diversity is not just an issue for those who are treading the boards either. There is the audience to consider too. Theatres such as the Royal Court and the National have been proactive in welcoming audiences beyond the trusty demographic of white, middle-aged and middle-class theatregoing stalwarts.Earlier this year, Michelle Greenidge featured in the National’s Nine Night (she is also in After Life, Ricky Gervais’s new Netflix series, as well as tucker green’s play), and she was thrilled by the audience it pulled in. Its plot hinged around the Jamaican tradition of a nine-night funeral wake and its run drew the biggest percentage of BAME audience members at the National. From the stage, Greenidge felt that they “weren’t regular, seasoned theatregoers” by the way they reacted in the auditorium, and that the usual etiquette did not apply. “It was an amazing feeling,” she says.Abrefa thinks it is the usual “etiquette” that so often alienates or intimidates new audiences. “How to be in the theatre, how to dress and be in a space they probably feel they’re not supposed to be in – that’s what they’re up against. It’s about breaking that feeling down but it can’t only be done on one side. Both sides have to be in it together.”Featherstone has seen changes, she says, especially in the fallout from the #MeToo movement, but she still feels as if equality is an ongoing battle against power, privilege and patriarchy. The establishment still resists change, she suggests. She feels that this was demonstrated by the controversy over the renaming of Kiln theatre in London (formerly the Tricycle) in which its new female artistic director, Indhu Rubasingham, faced fierce criticism for making the change (“Indhu is extraordinary,” says Featherstone).Yet she does think something has ruptured, and “the rupture is showing horrors but now, for the first time at the age of 51, I feel as if I’ve sniffed the possibility of something else…”Lashana Lynch is hopeful too. The next generation of women will all be playing superheroes, she jokes. But she questions the breadth of the inclusivity we are seeing, however much the ground is levelling for actors of colour: “What’s on screen and theatre needs to reflect life. That’s what ersity would mean, not that we have ticked the box now because we have a black person on board. It’s about what you see when you open the door and leave the house in the morning.”Ear for eye runs until 24 November at the Royal Court, London.

But Uber is continuing to appeal the ruling, made two years ago at the central London employment tribunal.“These figures lay bare the human cost of Uber continuing to refuse to accept the ruling,” said GMB legal director Sue Harris. “While the company is wasting money losing appeal after appeal, drivers are up to £18,000 out of pocket. That’s thousands of drivers struggling to pay their rent, or feed their families. It’s time Uber admits defeat and pays up. The company needs to stop wasting money dragging its lost cause through the courts. Instead, Uber should do the decent thing and give drivers the rights to which those courts have said they are legally entitled.”However, a spokeswoman for Uber said “almost all” taxi and private hire drivers had “been self-employed for decades”, long before Uber existed. She quoted an Oxford University study based on a poll commissioned by Uber, which found that its drivers make more than the London Living Wage. She added: “If drivers were classed as workers, they would inevitably lose some of the freedom and flexibility that come with being their own boss.” Since the ruling, Uber says it has given drivers more control over how they use its app, plus sickness, maternity and paternity protection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9573cfe6428bdb7c569902ff3e223444b835fa6b/0_77_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7cfdeeca295f40b0f388feec82d1da6","title":"dodge city polling place voter suppression voting rights","story":"A small Kansas town is caught in the middle of a political gunfight over moving its only polling stationIt’s true that if Alejandro Rangel wants to vote on election day, he has to get out of Dodge.But that is not the whole story.Befitting its status as an iconic city of the American West with a reputation built around legendary outlaws and mythical lawmen, Dodge City is now caught in the middle of a political gunfight that has swiftly generated its own half-truths and spiraled into a national controversy.The Democrats drew first, pointing out that the only place to vote in Dodge City on election day is being moved two and a half miles from the city center to an exhibition hall in what amounts to an urban wilderness. The move, they said, will further disenfranchise Latinos who make up a majority of the city’s residents but turn out to vote in very low numbers and have no one from their community elected to the city or county commissions.Rangel, a high school student voting in his first election, said that casting a ballot on election day has never been easy in Dodge City, which has long had a single polling place for more than 13,000 registered voters, and now it will be harder. Both his parents, who were born in Mexico, work long shifts at the beef slaughterhouses that brought Latino migrants to the city and underpin its prosperity.“My father waited up to two hours to vote in the last election because the lines were so long. Now they’ve moved it out of town, it’s out of the way. If you don’t have a car you have to get a bus.,” he said.“It’s either deliberate suppression or gross incompetence,” he said.The polling station move drew national attention after the American Civil Liberties Union protested. Democrats framed it within President Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Republican moves to disenfranchise minority voters in other states and the raw politics of immigration in Kansas.Kris Kobach, Kansas secretary of state and Republican candidate for governor, has been accused of voter suppression after attempting to require voters to prove their US citizenship. Kobach, who headed Trump’s voter fraud commission, has made an issue of alleging that foreigners vote illegally even though there is no evidence it is even a minor problem in the state.The ACLU said the law was based on “a xenophobic lie that non-citizens are engaged in rampant election fraud” . A federal judge blocked the move to require proof of citizenship in a ruling that was sharply critical of Kobach.Kobach is in a tight race for governor and there is heightened suspicion of any move that might discourage opponents from voting against him.All this has put the official responsible for moving the Dodge City polling station at the center of the storm. The Ford County clerk, Debbie Cox, an elected Republican, agreed to talk to the . Cox is stunned and disturbed by the criticism that has rained down on her.“I’ve been accused of disenfranchising the voters, and against one party or another. This had nothing to do with party affiliation at all. Yes, I am a registered Republican but I don’t vote a straight ticket. That had nothing to do with the decision because everyone in Dodge City is going to have to go there to vote,” she said.Long before Cox was elected, Dodge City consolidated voting into a single polling station at the civic center in the mid-1990s after a new federal law on access for people with disabilities meant that many existing places people went to vote could no longer be used. What was intended as a temporary measure became the norm.The civic center just happens to be in the heart of the white part of Dodge City and next to the country club and its golf course. A demographic map of the city shows it is largely segregated by a single road, Comanche Street. To the north are the white neighborhoods. South are almost entirely Latino.Cox said that when she was notified of construction work between the civic center and its parking lot she decided to move the voting. She said she did not want thousands of people walking through or around the construction site.“It could snow storm. There could be ice. That is a long ways to walk through with construction and ice. So my concern was the safety of the voters. Disenfranchising the voters was not my intent,” she said.Cox said she chose the Expo site because it has large amounts of parking and can handle thousands of people. Although the new voting site is closer to mainly Latino neighbourhoods than white ones, it is still a drive or a 50-minute walk from downtown.But there is a piece of the story missing from the national uproar.While the only place to vote on election day itself is at the Expo center, there is a polling station in the heart of Dodge City at the county’s offices on Gunsmoke Street open weekdays for three weeks before the election. A steady stream of people makes it to the fourth floor of the converted hotel that serves as the county offices to cast their ballots. Cox says that around 150 to 200 people a day have been voting over the past week which she takes as a sign of a good turnout judged against typical elections in Dodge City. Almost half of those who will vote do so at the downtown location ahead of election day.In truth, there are more options to vote in Dodge City than in many European countries. In Britain, there is a single day of voting, no early voting and limited voting by mail.Still, that does not explain why Dodge City only has a single polling station on election day itself when neighbouring cities of similar population have a handful. As the ACLU pointed out to Cox, the average polling place in Kansas serves 1,200 voters. In Dodge City, it technically serves 13,000.By now, schools and other public buildings meet the legal requirements for disabled access and are typically used across the US as voting sites. The local schools superintendent even offered to make buildings available.Cox said she has only been county clerk for three years and “is still getting her feet under the table”. But she offers a number of explanations. The first is that the traffic is awful near schools in the mornings.“I feel like that would be more of a disservice to the voters because we have a lot coming in at 7am when the polls open, and for them to be tied up in traffic and to find a parking location at that time would be next to impossible,” she said.Worse than having to wait in line for an hour or two to vote?“The only time that I know of that the lines were that long was at the last presidential election, and that was towards the end of the day when people came at the same time. They can come anytime,” she said.Cox is not persuaded by Rangel’s argument that his father works long shifts and has only limited time to vote.“If they have a job that is shift work, that they are working 12 hours, I would suggest that they get their ballot by mail. I would suggest that they come up and vote in office on Saturday or anytime,” she said.Johnny Dunlap, chair of the Ford County Democratic party, doesn’t buy any of this.“None of her excuses hold water,” he said. “I don’t think it was necessarily malicious. I think it was a poor choice. Ill-advised. This is not convenient for anyone. It’s not part of the town. It’s absurd to move it out there.”But then he reflected and said that it may be calculated after all.“These are not stupid people. It’s either purposeful or callous. The outcome is voter suppression,” he said.Cox fires back by sayingthe real racism lies with portraying Latino voters as incapable.“I’m really starting to resent that they’re treating our Hiic population like they they don’t know how to get to a place, that they don’t know where things are. The location that I have chosen is used for many many things and people get there,” she said. The city responded quickly to the criticism by saying it would provide free bus rides to the polling station and by emphasizing the council has made efforts to help residents obtain citizenship and to promote cultural integration.Rangel acknowledges that there is less friction than might be expected in a town that has seen relatively swift demographic change, although the Trump election campaign was testing.“During the presidential election, there as a lot of tension in school. A lot of Hiic students were angry that their white friends families voted for this man,” he said.Rangel also said, that for all the issues around the polling station, there are deeper forces at work in discouraging voting. The real issue, he said, is less overt discrimination than marginalisation.“There’s really no motivation to vote,” said Rangel. “I think the sentiment is my vote doesn’t matter and there’s no one to represent me. A lot of Hiics are scared. They don’t want to put their voice out there. They don’t have anyone to speak for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States.

In office since 2005, and serving a fourth term, she is widely regarded, inside and outside Germany, as Europe’s de facto leader. Clear political principles, exemplified by her brave, open-door migration policy and willingness to stand up to Donald Trump, coupled with a pragmatic sense of what’s possible, have sustained her this far.The end of the Merkel era could have dire implications for the future cohesiveness of Europe and the EU. The timing could hardly be worse, as political fragmentation and polarisation reach epidemic proportions. Of the two other leading regional powers, Britain, a traditional ally of Berlin, has become a liability, wholly preoccupied with a mutually damaging Brexit process that is setting a worrying EU precedent.As a leader on the international stage, Macron is also proving a isive figure, very different from Merkel. Casting himself as Europe’s champion against the rising forces of illiberalism and populism, he recently picked a fight with Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s nationalist leader, and Italy’s hard-right deputy prime minister, Matteo Salvini.Macron characterises the two men, and likeminded politicians in Poland and elsewhere, as a danger to cherished EU principles of open borders, open markets and open societies. “If they want to see me as their principal opponent, they are right. I will cede nothing to the nationalists and their language of hate,” he declared grandly.As analyst Robert Zaretsky argues, Macron’s attempt to impose an either-or choice, in the manner of Charles de Gaulle, could engender even greater polarisation at a time when Europe’s established political order is breaking up. “Insisting upon the ision between liberalism and illiberalism obscures the inconvenient truth that a range of alternatives exists between these ideological poles,” Zaretsky wrote. “As the French socialist Pierre Moscovici noted, ‘Not all pro-Europeans have the same ideas’.”As Merkel’s star dims, Macron may try to use next May’s crucial EU parliamentary elections to claim the mantle of Europe’s leader and revive his standing at home. Salvini, leader of Italy’s hard-right Lega, has similar ideas about the watershed nature of May’s polls. He and France’s Marine Le Pen view the vote as a decisive moment for Europe’s future direction. They plan to campaign for a “Europe of nations” free of Brussels’ collectivist, dirigiste embrace.Salvini and his allies in Italy’s populist Five-Star Movement directly challenged the EU last week with a high-spending national budget proposal that flouts Brussels’ rules on debt and threatens to sink Macron’s plans for further eurozone integration. This defiance is also aimed at Germany, which Salvini’s supporters accuse of Greece-style financial bullying.If it continues unchecked, this process of internal political fragmentation, spurred by the serial successes of populist-nationalist parties in eastern Europe, the Low Countries and most recently in Sweden, where (like in Germany) the centrist Social Democrats suffered their worst result in living memory, could become an existential upheaval that permanently changes the face of Europe. External threats, from Russia in the east to Trump’s America in the west, add to the sense of looming crisis.Not since the 1930s, perhaps, has Europe’s political stability, cohesion, and broadly democratic consensus been under greater challenge. Merkel symbolises steadiness, safety and continuity. If, or rather when, she falls, she will be much missed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c8b5096790f3d96b707f04e75b8369b1f42ed2a/0_267_5175_3106/master/5175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a71a0701c7ca74cf6d897b7d84eefa05","title":"rome says enough thousands rally to denounce citys decaying state","story":"Protesters blame Five Star Movement mayor Virginia Raggi for failing to clean up citySeveral thousand people demonstrated in the centre of Rome to denounce the ragged state of the Italian capital, where roads are potholed, rubbish often goes uncollected and wild boar roam the streets.Under the hashtag #romadicebasta (“Rome says enough”) residents’ associations and civil society groups banded together to organise Saturday’s protest, drawing between 5,000 and 8,000 people.Critics say the city has been in decline for years and accuse the mayor, Virginia Raggi, who took office in 2016, of failing to fulfil campaign promises to clean up the mess.“We’re here because Rome deserves better, because Rome is in a state of neglect the like of which has never been seen before,” said Marita Monaco, 57, who took part in the protest in a Renaissance square in front of the city’s town hall.“It is a city in disarray, where there are no more rules or social cohesion.”Raggi is a member of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement and was swept to power following a wave of public disgust over corruption scandals that had battered previous leftwing and rightwing administrations.The first female mayor in the history of the city, Raggi says she needs more time to overcome Rome’s myriad problems, but argues that she is already making good progress.Her critics say things are getting worse, not better. A strike by rubbish collectors has left many rubbish bins overflowing, while potholes riddle the roads and the local transport system is in permanent crisis.More than 20 buses have caught fire on the streets of the city so far this year, largely the result of poor maintenance, while a broken escalator injured more than 20 Russian football fans at a city metro station last Tuesday.The death this week of a 16-year girl, whose body was found in an abandoned building used by drug dealers, underscored fears about law and order in the city. Police say they believe the girl was gang-raped and have arrested four migrants.“Rome has become an open sewer, a scandal, full of rats, foxes, wild boar and rubbish,” said Rome resident Salvatore Golino. “We are drowning in trash and we can’t take it anymore.”A recent video that went viral online showed a family of boars foraging through sacks of rubbish on a city street. Another video earlier this year showed a large boar running up a major city road under the gaze of astonished drivers.Raggi is standing trial for alleged abuse of office over a contested appointment within her administration. She has denied the accusation, but has said she will resign if found guilty.

Authorities shut down museums and safely stored away more than 300,000 artefacts, but many sites were destroyed by the Islamic State group, damaged by the fighting or looted.Head of the General Directorate for Antiquities and Museums, Mahmoud Hammoud, said four of the five sections of the museum will be opened to showcase hundreds of archaeological findings that date back to the prehistoric, historical, classical and Islamic eras. He said some artefacts restored or seized by the Syrian authorities will also be on display.More than 9,000 artefacts have been restored and reclaimed since the war began, he said, noting that the museum needs renovation and funds. He said hundreds of thousands of important artefacts and sculptures were smuggled abroad during the crisis.Visitors will be able to watch as specialists restore hundreds of objects reclaimed from Palmyra, which Isis militants overtook for months, destroying some of the world’s most famous monuments.Bartosz Markowski, a Polish specialist in conservation of stone sculpture and architectural detail, said he had been working in Palmyra before the war broke out.“I am saving heritage, mostly in Palmyra, where I have been working before the crisis,” he told the Associated Press. “I came right after liberation and helped with urgent conservation and protection of destroyed objects in Palmyra … There is still a lot of damage in Palmyra.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2402e675c33b007844222c059639e40249afacd5/0_80_3042_1825/master/3042.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09ae0440982439e16e9fe656579e082c","title":"twitter facebook saudi oppression","story":"One of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent exiled activists has quit Twitter and Facebook, saying that the social media giants have become tools for oppressive governments and trolls to harass and silence campaigners.Manal al-Sharif, one of the leading figures in Saudi women’s long fight for the right to drive in their homeland, deleted her Twitter account live on stage at the SingularityU Nordic “global innovation” conference last week.“Twitter is really a powerful tool, and its being used against us,” she said, before closing the account, which has nearly 300,000 followers. In a video posted the next day on YouTube, she said Twitter had saved her life as a campaigner in Saudi Arabia, but today had become a playground for mobs of “trolls, pro-government mobs and bots”, many paid for by oppressive governments.“If the same tools we joined for our liberation are being used to oppress us and undermine us, and used to spread fake news and hate, I’m out of these platforms,” she said, adding she would continue to campaign, calling for the creation of more ethical social media.Sharif, who left Saudi Arabia several years ago for self-imposed exile, and remains a prominent voice on human rights and feminism, said she had also deleted her Facebook account. Her protest comes at a time of increased concern about how social media has been used to spread disinformation, and intense debate about how companies should balance controls on abusive behaviour with stated commitment to free speech.The Saudi government is among many autocratic regimes to have poured huge amounts of money and energy into creating a pro-government Twitter presence.Inside Saudi Arabia, activists have been effectively silenced by several waves of detentions. Among those jailed are many of the other women who campaigned with Sharif for the right to drive, while Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tries to garner credit for the change.But the brutal killing of dissident Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at the start of this month has highlighted the Saudi state’s determination to crush dissent beyond its borders.Sharif said online harassment was another face of that campaign, but vowed she would not be silenced.“Twitter now is becoming a trap, and it’s being used in a very efficient way by those governments, dictatorships and tyrants to silence us, and not only that, to spread their own propaganda, their own hate speech, misinformation and disinformation,” she said.“I’ll continue speaking up because tyrants and dictators are the ones who should be afraid, not us.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3675490.1540469421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the clocks have gone back but is it for the last time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarch of time: winter and summer clock changing may soon be a thing of the past.Did you enjoy that extra hour of sleep as the clocks went back this morning? Savour that moment because this may well be the very last time this particular ritual will ever happen.If all goes according to a plan laid out by the European Commission, the last-ever mandatory clock change in the European Union will take place in 2019. Member states must notify the commission by April of next year on whether they want to opt for permanent summer or permanent winter time. Whether all 27 states are prepared to go along, however, is not yet clear.This weekend, the Department of Justice (which has responsibility for everything to do with timekeeping) is announcing plans for its public consultation here on the proposal.A recent European Commission online public consultation across the EU found 84 per cent of citizens were in favour of ending the changing of clocks in spring and autumn.The commission trumpeted the fact that it had got 4.6 million responses, the highest number ever received in an exercise of this sort, and that 84 per cent of those backed the change to a single year-round time.Less loudly advertised was the fact that engagement varied significantly from country to country three million of those responses came from Germany, representing almost 4 per cent of that country’s population. In contrast, less than 0.25 per cent of Irish people bothered to respond.The question now is whether inidual member states will agree to proceed along the lines advocated by the commission, which has stated a preference for summer time to be applied universally. There is potential for chaos, with a patchwork of time zones emerging across continental Europe.Initial polling, for example, suggests people in the Netherlands and Denmark would prefer permanent winter time, while Germans want summer time.“We are not proposing that the whole EU either switches to summer or winter time,” said transport commissioner Violeta Bulc at a press conference last month. “All we are proposing is that we do it together.”But clock-switching on the Dutch-German border is hardly the desired outcome.An intriguing twist from the Irish perspective is whether the UK, at a moment of heightened political tension, will view this as a symbolic opportunity to flaunt its newly acquired independence.Brexiteers’ enthusiasm for such a stance may be dimmed when they realise it would mean Britain sharing a time zone with Brussels and Berlin for almost half the year.But understandably, media coverage here so far has focused on the prospect of travellers from Dundalk to Newry having to adjust their watches – or of people nipping across from Lifford to Strabane in search of an extra hour’s drinking time.For obvious geographical and historical reasons, Ireland and the UK have been on the same clock since the regional time zone concept was first introduced in the 19th century. We moved in lockstep with the UK when it experimented with year-round summer time in the late 1960s, and any recent proposals for change, such as one mooted in a Private Members’ Bill rejected by then minister for justice Alan Shatter in 2013, have been contingent on decisions made at Westminster and, more recently, in Brussels.So what would the changes mean? If Ireland opts for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, then dawn won’t break in the west of Ireland until almost 10am in mid-December. However, if “winter time” is maintained throughout the year, sunrise in Dublin will occur well before 4am in June, and the stretch in the evenings will be a lot less grand, with sunset happening before 9pm even in midsummer.Those are the extremes, but where permanent summer time offers real gains is in the “shoulder months” of November, February and March, when the majority of people will have much more daylight at the end of their school or working day without too much negative impact in the mornings.There has been a broad attempt across the world in recent decades to do away with annual time-shifts, based on data about their negative health effects and on a more general sense that an additional hour of daylight in the evening is more valuable than one in the morning.Meanwhile, the main rationale for the current system – reduced electricity usage – has been rendered less important by the introduction in recent years of energy-efficient electric lighting. Lifestyles have also changed enormously since the current system’s introduction a century ago, and even since the last experimental change 50 years ago.Flexible working time, increased leisure opportunities and longer retail opening hours all have an effect on how we spend our day.The main impediment to change, it seems, is institutional. In the US, legislators in California and other states are also pushing for year-round daylight-saving\u0026nbsptime, but they need to persuade the federal government before they can proceed. As in the EU, American legislation allows each state to decide its time zone but forbids inidual states from choosing when or if to change their seasonal clocks. Whether the gridlocked US political system can respond remains to be seen.Here, the Department of Justice’s public consultation asks three questions. Do you want to stop changing the clocks twice a year? If the clock changes stop, do you want to remain on summer time or winter time? Is staying on the same time as the UK more important than your choice of summertimewintertime?“It is very important that as many citizens as possible respond to this consultation and express their views so that the Government may take account of public opinion when considering this proposal by the EU,” says Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, clearly implying that the Government will take account of public opinion without being bound by it.Ultimately the success or failure of the proposal may come to be seen as a test of the EU’s ability to act quickly and decisively on a simple issue which will have an almost immediate effect upon people’s lives. The process so far has been startlingly fast, but the national consultations may be a different matter, depending perhaps on the views of the people who get up early in the morning."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Peter Casey \u0026lsquostood up for something\u0026rsquo and won support because of that \u0026ndash councillorIncumbent breaks record despite lowest turnout of any presidential ballot everStructural issues found at five facilities with six cleared to fully reopenPolice are appealing for witnesses after the collision on the Beltany Road\u0026lsquoAll useless\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquono to abortion\u0026rsquo among comments on spoiled ballot papersSpike in Twitter activity when exit poll published on Friday nightBrexit could see Ireland on different time to Northern IrelandIrish people \u0026lsquoexceedingly lucky\u0026rsquo to have \u0026lsquophilosopher-president\u0026rsquo Higgins, tweets former Greek finance minister VaroufakisMesera Dubiso took home the women\u0026rsquos title, while Ireland\u0026rsquos Lizzie Lee finished thirdBirdwatch Ireland is seeking to explain why murmurations are becoming less frequentIrish fan Sean Cox suffered traumatic brain injury during assault ahead of Roma gameFirst runners started at 8.55am and rolling road closures are in place along the routeAnd the winning numbers are: 14, 24, 30, 38, 40, 45, but no winner of Plus 1 or 2 drawsPedestrian suffers serious injuries in incident on M8 near MoateCasey polls strongly to finish second while voters back removal of blasphemy offenceComments after securing second term could be as critical of poll runner-up Peter Casey"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678571.1540734274!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clocks going back public asked for views on abolishing changes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe clocks went back on Sunday and this might be one of the last times this happens, if the public opts to change.

A key issue for Ireland is, with the UK leaving the EU in March 2019, the country will potentially be on a different time to Northern Ireland for half the year.“It is important to acknowledge that if the UK were to adopt a different position, this would present particular challenges for the island of Ireland. Any position adopted by Ireland will be informed by this important consideration,” the Minister said.A previous EU-wide public consultation suggested more people in the union are in favour of abolishing clock changes.Permanent summer time would mean brighter evenings and darker mornings in winter while permanent winter time would mean brighter mornings and darker evening in summer.1.

A message on the website said: “Over the past number of months Sean has been taking small but important steps on a road to recovery.“His journey will be a long and difficult one and the focus will continue on ensuring the best possible care to maximise the potential in Sean’s recovery.”Mr Cox will require ongoing and intensive long term care and support.“The reality is that the provision of this long term care and support for Sean will necessitate significant funding over many years.”“As you are aware, our colleague and friend Sean Cox sustained serious and life altering injuries earlier this year while attending a football game in Liverpool.” reads the GoFundMe page.Jay McKenna, who is the chair of the Liverpool fan group Spirit of Shankly, took to Twitter over the weekend to urge supporters to spare what they could to help Mr Cox.“The level of solidarity from so many from our community and beyond for Sean, Martina, Jack, Shauna and Emma since this tragic incident has been overwhelming and is deeply appreciated by Sean’s family.“Over the past number of months Sean has been taking small but important steps on a road to recovery. His journey will be a long and difficult one and the focus will continue on ensuring the best possible care to maximise the potential in Sean’s recovery.Last week, Roma fan Filippo Lombardi (21) was cleared of being part of a joint attack on Mr Cox.During the trial at Preston Crown Court, Mr Cox’s brother Martin told the court his brother could not speak or sit up unaided following the attack.The court heard another man had been arrested in Rome in connection with the attack and was awaiting extradition."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678243.1540736864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miche%C3%A1l martin pours cold water on casey s plan to join fianna f%C3%A1il","story":"Arriving at the Dublin count at the Convention Centre, Independent candidate Peter Casey says he will run for president again - unless he is Taoiseach at the time of the next presidential election.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Casey: ‘I’ll definitely not be standing as a county councillor, that’s far too much hard work.’ Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPresidential runner-up Peter Casey has said he plans to join Fianna Fáil with a view to eventually becoming Taoiseach, although leader Micheál Martin has already poured cold water on the idea.The presidential candidate said he intends to run in the next general election in Donegal, with a view to becoming head of a renewed and revitalised Fianna Fáil, according to an interview with the Sunday Independent.“The Fianna Fáil party was always about the people of Ireland, but I believe the party has lost its way in recent years and lost this position, as the party that listens to ordinary people of Ireland and represents their concerns,” he said.“I want to be the one that leads Fianna Fáil back to its natural home as the party of the people, to get outside of the bubble of Dublin and Leinster House and the political and media establishment.”The Derry man, whose campaign was marked by criticisms of Travellers and their separate ethnic status, polled strongly with 342,727 votes, or 23.25 per cent of the overall vote. President Michael D Higgins was re-elected comfortably with 822,566 votes, or 55.81 per cent.An Ipsos MRBI opinion poll on October 17th showed support for Mr Casey at 2 per cent.The Fianna Fáil leader said Mr Casey lacked a “coherent or cohesive” political vision.“I was listening to Peter this morning and I didn’t get any clear coherent sense of ideas he wants to take forward,” he said.“I heard Peter describe himself as a compassionate socialist and compassionate capitalist in the same sentence so it seemed he was almost heading towards a middle ground very quickly.”Mr Martin said he recognised Mr Casey may have struck a chord with the electorate with his outspokenness, but said he did not get sense of a move to the right in Irish politics.“This is a presidential election, people may feel a bit more liberty to vote in a certain direction and will vote differently in a general election because it’s a about the formation of a government and differently too in local election and European elections,” he said.Mr Casey says there is no longer any need for him to publish his tax returns as the presidential election is over.Asked about his tax returns Mr Casey said: “I am totally tax compliant in every jurisdiction”.Mr Casey had previously said he was in the process of changing his tax status as he is currently not tax resident in Ireland.Asked if he would run for the European Parliament next year he said: “I’m not sure that would be the course for me”.Arriving at the Dublin count at the Convention Centre on Saturday, Mr Casey said he was “disappointed” by his expected second place finish as “I really thought I had a very good chance of winning”.Mr Casey said he would join a political party or form his own. He quipped that he would run for president again - unless he is Taoiseach at the time of the next presidential election.Speaking about his future political ambitions, Mr Casey said he would make a decision “next week”.Mr Casey told RTÉ’s Marian Finucane Show that he was a compassionate socialist, but does not feel he fits into any political party. “We do need to look after the people who need looking after. Can’t give social welfare if there’s no money in the kitty,” he said.He also appeared to do a u-turn on comments he made earlier on Saturday that there was a need for a new political party. “There are enough political parties,” he said.Mr Casey believed the likely results were a “frustration vote”.“There had been three and a half years of “this being no Government and we’re now talking about extending that period”.He said with 6 per cent unemployment that meant 94 per cent were getting up in the morning and “struggling”.“Middle Ireland – they’re the ones that are really frustrated”.Mr Casey also said if Mr Martin had stuck to a two-year arrangement for the confidence and supply Government “he’d be Taoiseach now”.He again rejected as “absolutely untrue” suggestions that his remarks about Travellers were racist.Mr Casey said you cannot be racist if you do not regard the people you’re talking about as a different race. “They’re Irish people and proud Irish people so that’s not possible.”Asked what political party he identified most with he said his politics were “more left of centre than right of centre” and there was not a lot of difference between the parties.Mr Casey said he was still waiting for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to apologise to him. “I think it’s the first time in history that I’m aware of that a Taoiseach has come out against a person who was nominated by four counties. He went and said to people not to vote for me. I think that’s disgraceful.”Asked what politician he identified with he said: “I don’t really have any idols in Irish politics.“Obviously John Hume was such a courageous and great leader and was not afraid to say things that were not particularly popular.”He competed in the presidential election because it was an opportunity to make a difference, Mr Casey said.Cork North Central Sinn Féin TD Jonathan O’Brien acknowledged Mr Casey had beaten their candidate Liadh Ní Riada in working-class areas such as Gurrranabraher, Farranree, Churchfield and the Glen where the party had performed strongly in the last general election.“I think a lazy analysis will be that Casey took our vote in working-class areas,” he said.“But it’s pretty clear that we didn’t get our vote out and that is something we need to reflect on but I don’t think it’s as simple as saying Casey took our votes in working class areas - our vote didn’t come out. I’ve no doubt some of it went to Michael D as well because he is a popular president.”Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3676819.1540624742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schoolgirls on brexit the adults are not thinking straight","story":"School children from Crossmaglen talk to Simon Carswell from the  about living on the border, Brexit and the Troubles.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsGavin Duffy tried to take his wooden spoon finish the presidential election in good spirits, but the businessman may have lost more than just the chance to reclaim his expenses from the bruising contest.Taking to the podium in Dublin Castle after Michael D Higgins made his acceptance speech on Saturday night, Duffy joked he was glad speaking time for those making concession speeches was not allocated on the basis of first preference votes.Coming sixth and last, Duffy only won 32,198 number one votes – or 2.2 per cent of the total – and 3.8 per cent behind Joan Freeman, who finished fifth.A series of poor interviews during the campaign, across print and broadcast media, may damage Duffy’s longer term interests.His company, Gavin Duffy and Associates, specialises in media training and communications and its website says he and his wife Orlaith Carmody, at Duffy’s side throughout the campaign, “know what it takes to become an excellent communicator”.As Duffy lurched from poor interview to poor interview, colleagues of his in the communications sector almost winced as his professional reputation suffered along with his chances of a decent showing come polling day.Senior figures in the industry privately said Duffy’s entire presidential endeavour – including promising policy papers, some of which did not materialise – has caused damage to his business that will take time to repair.“That would be a fair comment from some, but I don’t think it will damage my business,” he said on Saturday.“The general comment, if I was to judge by social media, was that I conducted myself with dignity and respect for others throughout.”He said his only regret was the money – an estimated €100,000 - that he lost fighting the campaign, and claimed if the issues he raised during the campaign did not resonate with the public then perhaps he was “slightly ahead of where public concerns are around the changes we are facing in society”.Duffy did not rule out running for public office again but said “there’s a perception amongst the public that it’s a bit audacious that the first office you run for is the head of State.... there’s two things in life, you either succeed or you learn”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3678775.1540747169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"se%C3%A1n gallagher says he makes no excuses for his reduced vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Seán Gallagher  with his wife, Patricia,  at Dublin Castle. Photograph: Reuters Clodagh KilcoyneDefeated presidential candidate Seán Gallagher has not ruled out a future involvement in politics, though he conceded his campaign and his messages had failed to connect with voters in this election.Mr Gallagher acknowledged he had been hurt by the result of the election, but said “nobody has died”, and he believed he was right to put himself forward for a second tilt at the presidency.Seven years ago, having been pipped at the post by President Michael D Higgins after a dramatic late turnaround in the campaign, many felt Mr Gallagher had unfinished business with the presidency. There was little of that sense around this weekend past.Asked by reporters if he would run again in the future for the Áras, Mr Gallagher said: “We’ll deal with this one for the moment before we think about going beyond 2018.”He added: “I think I’ll decide that I won’t make any decisions today.“But I remain as committed to the country as ever. I won’t make any decision now but I do know truthfully Ireland is going to face a lot of challenges in the future.“If I can use my skills and abilities I will, but how, I don’t know,” Mr Gallagher told reporters at the count centre at Dublin Castle. Mr Gallagher won 29 per cent of the first preference vote in 2011, having led in opinion polls over the final weekend of the campaign. That lead slipped and disappeared over the final days of the campaign after the controversy ignited by the Frontline presidential debate, but the former Dragons’ Den panellist still ended up with more than half a million votes. When the counting on Saturday last was completed, however, he won just 6 per cent of the vote, or less than 100,000 votes. Political sources across all parties were sceptical of a return to politics by Mr Gallagher in the future.As the result were being counted, Mr Gallagher said he “would have loved to have gotten a better result”.However, he said, “that’s the nature of elections and the people have spoken”. He said the short campaign made it “hard to build momentum” and said the small number of debates made it hard for challengers to make their case. However, he said, he was making “no excuses”.He told RTÉ television it would have been very difficult for any candidate to break through the level of support for the incumbent, Mr Higgins.He acknowledged the participation of three Dragons’ Den panellists may have resulted in public cynicism and split the vote. Mr Gallagher said he was the first person from a business background who had put himself forward and he “genuinely” wanted to see people with new skills and mindsets getting involved.Brexit and other issues had made this campaign different from the one in 2011, he said, and there had been an increase in the protest or anti-establishment vote.The highlight of the campaign for him had been his personal campaign launch in his home village in Cavan, while the low point was “hearing the result”.“Once you participate, you have to give it your best. After that it’s in the lap of the gods or, in this case, in the hands of the people,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3677035.1540567707!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us reluctance to acknowledge holocaust key part of exhibition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJews get off train in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. Photograph: Yad Vashem ArchivesAFPGetty Irene Weiss remembers her 14th birthday vividly. She had entered the Auschwitz concentration camp a few months earlier.Now 87, Weiss is one of the many iniduals that appear in Irish director Gerry Gregg’s acclaimed film Condemned to Remember.The film follows the journey of Dublin resident Tomi Reichental in his quest to find out the truth about what happened to him and others during the war.His journey leads him to an uncomfortable reckoning with the forces of racism and exclusion in contemporary Europe, from Srebenica to modern-day Hungary.Weiss and Reichental met in Germany during research for the film. Though they were interred at different concentration camps in Europe, their search for truth and justice brought them together more than half a century later.Earlier this month, they were reunited on stage in Washington DC for the film’s US premiere.Weiss is one of many Holocaust survivors who settled in the United States after the war, leaving behind a ravaged Europe to build a new life in America.But the US was not always so welcoming.An exhibition has opened at the Smithsonian’s Holocaust Museum in Washington which examines America’s response to the Holocaust. While more than 400,000 Americans ultimately died in the second World War, the country was initially reluctant to get involved – and to confront the humanitarian horrors unfolding in death camps across Germany and eastern Europe.Franklin D Roosevelt came to power in 1933 – the same year as Adolf Hitler – and was immediately confronted with the Great Depression. There was little appetite in the United States to lift immigration limits that had been introduced in the 1920s and to help the thousands of Jews desperate to leave Europe – despite widespread coverage of events in Germany in American newspapers.As Europe moved closer to war, and the Nazis’ targeting of Jews intensified, Roosevelt convened a summit in Evian, France, to forge an international response to the deepening refugee crisis. But to the dismay of Jewish groups in America, the conference yielded little, with the US agreeing simply to issue all visas allowed under existing laws rather than offer extra places.This unwillingness to respond to the deepening crisis in Europe persisted as US entry in the war became inevitable.In Congress, a Bill in February 1939 to admit 20,000 refugee children never made it to a vote.Later that year, the St Louis, a ship carrying 900 mostly Jewish refugees, arrived in Cuba but was refused entry. Sailing close to the coast of Miami its crew and passengers sought refuge in America but the ship was turned back and returned to Europe. Many of its passengers died in the Holocaust.The exhibition shows how this reluctance to confront the Holocaust persisted, even when Americans entered the war after Pearl Harbour.By 1942, the US administration knew about the existence of concentration camps.The state department comes in for particular censure in the exhibition. A damning report by US treasury officials presented to Roosevelt in January 1944 found that the department had deliberately suppressed reports about the extermination of Jews which termed it “one of the greatest crimes in history”.But while the exhibition takes a harsh look at th US’s conflicted response to the Holocaust as it was unfolding, the museum also highlights the role played by American soldiers in liberating Europe in 1945. Among its most powerful collections is the video footage of the army’s first encounter with concentration camps and the desperate bid to save those still alive.For survivors such as Anna Grosz, it is this aspect of America’s involvement in the war that is most important. Now 92, Grosz is one of several Holocaust survivors who volunteer at the Smithsonian museum.As she tells me on this quiet mid-week morning in Washington, she was transported to Auschwitz with the female members of her family in 1944. Her mother and two sisters were sent to the gas chambers while she and her remaining sisters were sent to work.After the Allied victory she returned to Romania with what was left of her family. “There was no life for us there,” she recounts. She moved to the US in 1964, securing a job as a seamstress and building a new life as an American. As she looks back, she is thankful to the US. “My sons received a college education, built good careers and happy lives. For that I am ever grateful to this country.”"},{"url":null,"title":"picture editors 25 favourite images princess eugenies royal","story":"Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank kiss after their wedding on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleThe traditional high street is dead and cannot be preserved in \u0026#39aspic\u0026#39, Chancellor saysLego targets mindfulness market with advert which tells women to use bricks to reduce stressOne dead in Sri Lanka shooting as constitutional crisis escalates Migrant caravan heads for the US: \u0026#39God-willing we will get a better life\u0026#3997-year-old, brothers and husband and wife among 11 victims of Pittsburgh synagogue shootingComment: The Pittsburgh shooting shows anti-Semitism is as real and terrifying as everCourt orders Paris tenant to pay all Airbnb earnings to landlord Jamie Oliver says he has no more money to shore up struggling restaurants Theresa May\u0026#39s plans to end austerity will be cancelled in no-deal Brexit, Philip Hammond suggestsIt was only \u0026#39banter\u0026#39, says Sir Philip Green after \u0026#39worst week\u0026#39Comment: In an ideal world, all MPs would have second jobsHunting ban law ‘more cruel’ to foxesClocks change: why do we use GMT, and will the EU soon put an end to \u0026#39falling back\u0026#39?Campaign to remember the Muslim heroes of the First World WarGreyhounds must be given same protection as race horses as MPs and Battersea demand protection for the dogs while they are in kennelsStop being snobby about tinned food, cook says as she writes first canned food recipe book since 1939Anglers hope youngsters will take the bait and join the sport to save fishing from going underSenior Tories in last-ditch plea for Universal Credit cash injectionDuchess of Sussex delivers major speech on feminism during New Zealand visitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000177653497_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0go9KzD8cVu9iguqnaKUswZA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"bbc legal correspondent wrong say nda signed freely","story":"BBC legal correspondent criticised for saying NDA was signed freely Court of AppealThe BBC has been told it is “inaccurate” to claim that women who entered into non-disclosure agreements after they had made allegations about sexual harassment did so “freely”.Media and employment lawyers have said it is likely there would be an “imbalance of power” during negotiations to settle a claim and therefore it was incorrect to view these contractual relationships as free of “abuse”.Yesterday, a BBC journalist claimed the judgment by the Court of Appeal “made clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure”.

The period of active pursuit from a fox being found to being flushed was over 5 times less.Dr Jeremy Naylor, an equine vet and former senior lecturer at Bristol University and one of the authors of the report, said the decision to restrict to two dogs in England and Wales seems to have been plucked out of the air.He added: We are making no welfare claims in our study but we are providing data which may inform the welfare argument. In the Burns Inquiry report they considered that one factor that might effectively compromise welfare is duration of active pursuit.Our data quite clearly indicated that a pack of hounds is considerably more effective at flushing in a considerably shorter duration.The study was commissioned by the Federation of Welsh Farmers’ Packs (FWFP), which represents hunts and clubs which traditionally used packs of hounds to flush and shoot foxes to protect sheep and other livestock.David Thomas, secretary of the FWFP, said: “The law as it stands in England and Wales is completely indefensible. Farmers’ packs were developed for the sole purpose of controlling foxes to limit the predation of lambs using the only practical method in a mountainous region with huge expanses of commercial forestry.“The limit of two dogs was plucked out of nowhere. There is no evidence or logical justification for it. Anti-hunting organisations have even admitted that: “pairs of dogs are utterly useless in flushing to guns.”He added: “Farm incomes in upland Wales are amongst the lowest in the country and it is simply not acceptable that farmers are not able to protect their flocks. The publication of this study emphasises once again why the law needs to change”.The Conservative Government brought forward proposals to amend the Hunting Act in 2015 to remove the limit on the number of dogs that can used to find and flush foxes in order to bring the law into line with Scotland.Tim Bonner, Chief Executive of the Countryside Alliance, which supports the FWFP’s call for a change in the law, said: “We are in a ridiculous situation where everyone knows the law has failed, there is peer reviewed science which proves that it is both inefficient and increases the duration of pursuit of foxes, and yet political prejudice continues to block change.“The publication of this research does, however, mean that those who oppose amendment of the law to allow the use of packs of dogs to flush foxes in England and Wales are doing so in direct opposition to peer-reviewed science. The arguments against hunting have always been illogical, but opposition to this amendment is now an indisputable rejection of the clearest science and evidence as well.”The traditional high street is dead and cannot be preserved in \u0026#39aspic\u0026#39, Chancellor saysLego targets mindfulness market with advert which tells women to use bricks to reduce stressOne dead in Sri Lanka shooting as constitutional crisis escalates Migrant caravan heads for the US: \u0026#39God-willing we will get a better life\u0026#3997-year-old, brothers and husband and wife among 11 victims of Pittsburgh synagogue shootingComment: The Pittsburgh shooting shows anti-Semitism is as real and terrifying as everCourt orders Paris tenant to pay all Airbnb earnings to landlord Jamie Oliver says he has no more money to shore up struggling restaurants Theresa May\u0026#39s plans to end austerity will be cancelled in no-deal Brexit, Philip Hammond suggestsIt was only \u0026#39banter\u0026#39, says Sir Philip Green after \u0026#39worst week\u0026#39Comment: In an ideal world, all MPs would have second jobsClocks change: why do we use GMT, and will the EU soon put an end to \u0026#39falling back\u0026#39?Campaign to remember the Muslim heroes of the First World WarGreyhounds must be given same protection as race horses as MPs and Battersea demand protection for the dogs while they are in kennelsStop being snobby about tinned food, cook says as she writes first canned food recipe book since 1939Anglers hope youngsters will take the bait and join the sport to save fishing from going underSenior Tories in last-ditch plea for Universal Credit cash injectionDuchess of Sussex delivers major speech on feminism during New Zealand visitWhat is Gab?

test merkel christian democrats look set lose control","story":"German Chancellor Angela Merkel faces another major blow as Germans go to the polls in HesseAngela Merkel\u0027s political future looks increasingly precarious with voters on Sunday predicted to deliver her party its second major electoral blow within a month.German Chancellor\u0027s conservative Christian Democrats are predicted to receive just 28 percent of the vote in Hesse, a bellwether state home to Frankfurt, the nation\u0027s financial hub.It would mark a 10-point drop from the state\u0027s last election in 2013, according to the latest poll from German broadcaster ZDF, and cement a larger trend in Germany of voters abandoning the chancellor for smaller fringe parties.Two weeks ago, Mrs Merkel\u0027s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, had its worst showing in six decades in the state\u0027s elections, while the Green Party won an historic 17.5 per cent of the vote.The Greens in Hesse are currently polling at 20 per cent, up from 11 per cent in 2013.The right-wing, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany also made significant gains in Bavaria, entering the state\u0027s regional parliament for the first time with 10 percent of the vote. The party is expected to secure 12 per cent today in Hesse, matching their numbers on the federal level, where they are the nation\u0027s third-largest political force.Another blow to Mrs Merkel\u0027s conservative bloc would present more difficulties for her as she heads to the Christian Democrats party convention in December, where a vote of confidence in her leadership will take place.Her government coalition with the centre-left Social Democrats almost toppled twice this summer due to internal squabbling over refugee policy.Please

doesn\u0027t appear to be bothered\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp50 Cent’s latest move\u0026nbspin their ongoing feud – in fact, he\u0027s laughing about it.\u0026nbspEarlier this weekend, 50 Cent claimed\u0026nbsphe had bought 200 tickets – at a total of around $3,000 – for the fellow rapper’s upcoming show, so Ja Rule\u0026nbspwould be performing to a section of empty seats at the gig on 9 November in Texas.\u0026nbspCommenting under the post, Fiddy\u0026nbspsaid: “I just bought 200 seats in the front so they can be empty. LOL.”He also posted a photoshopped image depicting himself sitting in an empty concert venue.“What a show, I mean just f***ing great. Do it again my kid went to the restroom. LOL,” he wrote in the caption directed at Ja Rule.Ja Rule doesn’t seem too troubled,\u0026nbspand even posted to say he was happy he’d got on 50 Cent’s nerves: “I get under @50cent skin….I love it!!!’ he wrote on Instagram, with several “amused face” emojis.\u0026nbspThe pair’s feud originally stems back to the Noughties, but kicked off again in January this year.50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, claims\u0026nbspthat Ja Rule, aka Jeffrey Atkins, incorrectly accused him of stealing his jewellery and brought it to the attention of Irv Gotti, the founder of Murder Inc. Records.\u0026nbspJa Rule, however, contends that the tension started between them during a video shoot in their hometown of Queens, NYC.Fiddy allegedly felt disrespected by the way Ja Rule greeted him on the shoot, which led to him releasing multiple diss records aimed at Ja Rule.\u0026nbsp50 Cent mocks Terry Crews for being a victim of sexual assault50 Cent is something of a liability on social media. In June, he shared then deleted a post mocking actor Terry Crews for speaking about male sexual assault.Crews, a proud feminist and supporter of the #MeToo movement, recently explained why he did not fight back against the man he accused of sexually assaulting him.While many people praised Crews for his moving testimony, rapper 50 Cent chose to mock the Brooklyn Nine-Nine star.\u0026nbspHe posted a photo of Crews shirtless with the text: “I got raped  My wife just watched” and then another of Crews with a rose in his mouth which said “Gym time.”He added the caption: “LOL what the f**k is going on out here man? Terry: I froze in fear... they would have had to take me to jail. Get the strap.”The comments section was instantly flooded with former fans and critics calling 50 out, branding him “disgusting” and observing: “This is why people hate you.”Asked for his thoughts on the comments by TMZ, Crews himself rose above it and simply said: “I love 50 Cent, I listen to his music when I\u0027m working out.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen\u0026nbspare facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the Paris Agreement\u0026nbsptargets. Investors have written to 55 companies, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups that might oppose progressive climate change policies. Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce\u0026nbspwere also approached. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy-intensive sectors”, investors said. The decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert a global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. The worst effects of global warming – including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities – will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C. Scientists think this figure will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, of the Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policymaking on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He was born in the Kerala region of southern India and his parents roamed the country working for the government as part of the rubber board. Then his father decided to go into the private sector, setting up as a producer of adhesives. “My dad wasn’t the best entrepreneur,” Janardana says. His father had no difficulty obtaining a line, or lines,\u0026nbspof credit – but not from entirely reputable sources. He was being charged 10 per cent per week i.e. a higher rate of interest than Wonga\u0026nbspused to levy. Labelling his father’s lenders\u0026nbsploan sharks is unfair to sharks. “Debt collection is not exactly regulated in India,” says Janardana the younger. “People were lining up outside the house screaming at us to give them their money back.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was the son who paid them all off in the end. He studied engineering, worked in telecoms, rolling out the network in India, then went to business school, was hired by Capital One, and started in its credit card office in Washington DC. Fortunately the exchange rate of dollars to rupees was favourable at the time. Junior, then aged 24, salvaged the family finances. In April 2008, I was labelled a party\u0026nbsppooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street\u0026nbspcrisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the\u0026nbspsubprime\u0026nbspmortgage business’“It’s more about reputation – face and respect – in India,” he says. “Sometimes your parents’ social security is you. To be fair, they wouldn’t have incurred so much debt if not for me. I was living off them for a long while.” In the wake of that traumatic experience, and while working for Capital One, lending to consumers, and having responsibility for collections and defaults, Janardana could feel defaulters’ pain. He was abnormally sensitive to any looming crisis. The year 2007 found him based in London. “We were all gung-ho for growth,” he says. But Janardana pointed out even when the economy was doing well, losses were piling up, and he forecast rocky times ahead.“In April 2008, I was labelled a party pooper. People said ‘it’s only a Wall Street crisis. It’s a US thing. We’re not in the subprime mortgage business’.” But Janardana’s warning was heeded and by September 2008, when everything unravelled, Capital One\u0026nbsphad a head start of three or four months, and had already shut down new custom\u0026nbspand reduced exposure. Still, “it wasn’t a fun time. Most of 2008 was spent just trying to survive.” By that\u0026nbsptime,\u0026nbspJanardana had decided not to return to the US, and to become a British citizen. Zopa attracted him because it was something completely different: a\u0026nbsp“peer-to-peer” system\u0026nbspin which investors and borrowers are brought together for mutual advantage, with Zopa in the middle, like the shaded area of a Venn diagram. One person’s loan is another’s investment. Investors do better than they would by parking money in a bank – albeit with higher risk – and borrowers get a much better deal than Janardana’s entrepreneurial father ever did. The typical borrowers are teachers and nurses in their mid-30s, often for the purpose of home improvements or buying a car. The average loan size is just under £10,000. With his engineering background, the thing that particularly pleased Janardana was how Zopa had managed to speed up the process of obtaining a loan. The business does its own risk assessment. But what really concentrated minds, was the question of comparison sites. Zopa had previously informed applicants if they could get a loan in 27 seconds flat. But Money Supermarket said approval had to be 12 seconds for it to show up on its site – Zopa got it down to seven. The exact rate is outlined within three minutes. “The real rate,” stresses Janardana, “not the ‘lowest rate’ – which is so misleading.” Janardana has been CEO since August 2015. “We’ve had a charmed four years,” he says. The business\u0026nbsphad a turnover of £265m in 2014-15, now it’s more than £1bn. Revenue has gone up from £11m to £45m. Customer satisfaction, according to Trust Pilot, hits 4.8 or 4.9 out of 5. Now Zopa is two years into building a fully-fledged online bank, and is running the registration gauntlet, performing the required stress tests. It\u0026nbspwants to “extend the ethos of peer-to-peer into retail banking”.The average amount people borrow from ZopaWe are sitting in the Zopa HQ on the south bank of the Thames, looking out at the river flowing languidly by, with the towers of the City leaning over it. It’s probably something to do with his personal history, and his mum and dad nearly going under, but when Janardana speaks of “giving customers more control”, it’s easy to feel the passion and conviction beyond the expression of good intentions. He objects to what he calls “the winlose model”. He ought to get a job as chancellor of the exchequer. In fact, he comes out with a line neither the chancellor – nor anyone else, other than Jeff Bezos\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspgets a chance to say very often. “We had too much money”. In other words, there was more lending than borrowing. Citizens Advice\u0026nbspknows\u0026nbspcustomers who renew loans generally get a worse rate than those who switch. Banks make money by upping the rate. “We could have pulled the same trick, but we don’t want to do that,” says Janardana, sounding a bit like Chris Tarrant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. “With us you always get the same rate as a new customer. A bank where we win, and our customers win.” Even if he is CEO, Janardana still talks regularly to the guy who handles “complaints”. He wants people to be happy and sometimes Janardana speaks more like a yoga teacher than a money expert. It’s rather zen and soothing. “I want,” he says, “to take away the points of tension.”A View from the TopShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Job cuts would probably affect Asda’s petrol, bakery, back office and “hosting” operations, as well as roles in its clothing arm, George, according to Press Association. In a statement, the company said: “In a competitive retail market, where customers rightly expect great value and ease of service, we must always look at how we can work more quickly and efficiently for them\u0026nbspand, inevitably, that means we need to consider changing the roles we need our colleagues to do, or the hours needed in particular parts of our stores.Asda cuts price of petrol by 2p a litreAsda customers steal shopping baskets to avoid paying for bags What removal of Asda price guarantee scheme will mean for shoppers“We believe the proposed changes we are consulting on would allow us to do a better job for our customers.“We also recognise that discussions about potential change aren’t easy. If the decision is taken to implement the proposed changes, we would work with our colleagues to look at the potential impact of these proposals on them.”The GMB union said Asda’s decision to announce potential job cuts just two months before Christmas was a bad one. Gary Carter, the union’s national officer,\u0026nbspsaid: “These proposed redundancies are a hammer blow to Asda workers. The timing of this announcement, in the run up to Christmas, is doubly appalling.”He added: “Asda is performing well and is highly profitable because of the hard work of our members, who are the backbone of the company. “These cuts make no sense whatsoever – slashing our members’ jobs would hurt the service ASDA customers receive. GMB will fight tooth and nail for every single job.“With all the speculation surrounding the proposed Sainsbury’s merger and potential sell offs of stores – this news will not put anyone’s mind at rest.”Asda and Sainsbury’s announced plans for a £10bn tie-up in April\u0026nbspand the deal is being scrutinised by the competition watchdog.Last month, Asda announced it was scrapping its price guarantee scheme, which gave customers money off if the cost of their shop was not 10 per cent cheaper than if bought at a rival chain. The company said at the time: “It’s a decision we’ve not taken lightly because we love it dearly, but in reality, we know our customers don’t love it enough for us to keep it.“Instead they want us to focus our investment on lowering our prices, and they’ll let us know if we’re falling out of step with the competition.”In July, the supermarket said it was entering into consultation with colleagues at its Enfield Home Shopping Centre in London, putting 261 jobs at risk.

Firms including BP, Rio Tinto and Volkswagen\u0026nbspare facing calls to reconsider their ties to lobbying organisations whose climate change policies do not match up to the Paris Agreement\u0026nbsptargets. Investors have written to 55 companies, asking them to “review the lobbying positions being adopted by the organisations of which you are a member”, particularly any groups that might oppose progressive climate change policies. Unilever, Nestle and Rolls-Royce\u0026nbspwere also approached. The 55 firms have been chosen due to their high greenhouse gas emissions and “significant role in energy-intensive sectors”, investors said. The decision to take action on “back-door” lobbying comes weeks after the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert a global environmental catastrophe.He may have accepted it but Trump will do nothing about climate changeClimate change to cause global beer shortage, research showsBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningUnder current climate commitments by world leaders, the Earth will be 3C warmer by the end of the century, according to the IPCC’s report. The worst effects of global warming – including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities – will only be avoided if the global temperature increase stays below 1.5C. Scientists think this figure will be exceeded within around 20 years. Adam Matthews, of the Church of England Pensions Board, said: “Misleading and misaligned corporate lobbying practices undermine the ability of governments to act on climate change and meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The influence of trade associations is often exerted behind closed doors and can be deeply insidious to public policymaking on climate change. “As the recent report from the IPCC clearly highlighted, the stakes are high and time is against us. It is therefore right that investors are challenging Europe’s most high-emitting companies to ensure consistency in their lobbying practices.”Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, said: “Long-term investors have a clear interest in the Paris Agreement being implemented to support the necessary transition to a low-carbon global economy. Shareholders should rightly expect companies in which they invest to advocate for the climate policy required for this to happen. This includes ensuring the trade bodies of which they are members are working to the same end.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Government policy seems stuck in reverse\u0027Click to followThe IndependentGreen campaigners have lined up to attack chancellor Philip Hammond for announcing a multi-billion-pound boost for building and upgrading roads – days after world scientists urgently warned that greenhouse gas emissions must be cut.In Monday’s budget, Mr Hammond is due to champion £30bn of funding for new roads and road repairs, hailing it “the biggest-ever cash injection for England’s largest roads”.\u0026nbspYet the chancellor is recycling an old Conservative party announcement, The Independent can reveal – and environmental experts including Greenpeace’s chief scientist said he should have done a U-turn on the party\u0027s earlier pledge.What will Phillip Hammond present in the budget?Hammond is ready to end austerity – if May agrees to his Brexit dealBanks and insurers must plan for climate change risks, says BoEGovernment urged to act fast on climate change after UN warningIt comes after the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report warned the world has 12 years in which to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. And earlier this month the government cut grants for electric cars and scrapped those for hybrids.Mr Hammond will say in his budget speech that a £28.8bn fund will be dedicated to strategically important roads such as motorways and major local routes, for improvements, upgrades and easing congestion under the plan, which covers 2020-25. Major new roads could be built too.He will also set aside extra cash to fix potholes, repair damaged roads, and trial new methods of transport such as electric bikes.But in the 2015 budget, then-chancellor George Osborne announced that for cars registered after April 2017, all vehicle excise duty would go to a new roads fund from 2020.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCar tax raises about £6bn\u0026nbspa year, and calculated across the five years of Mr Hammond’s plan for 2020-25, amounts to £30bn – the sum he will be trumpeting in the budget.Publicising the move in advance, the Treasury said: “This will be the first time ever that ‘road tax’ will only be spent on roads. Roads are a crucial part of transport infrastructure and it’s right that from 2020 motorists see their road tax directly paying for improvements to their roads.”But both Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace’s chief scientist Doug Parr said Mr Hammond should have reconsidered Mr Osborne’s plan.“It’s less than three weeks since we had a very severe warning from scientists on the effects of climate change. When we need to start cutting emissions, how compatible is this roads programme he’s talking about?” said Mr Parr.It’s very disappointing to see this government announce over and over again a ‘new’ roads programme“He should have considered the state of nature, of public transport, of pollution and of climate change and done a U-turn.”Friends of the Earth’s campaigns director Liz Hutchins said: “Doesn’t Philip Hammond read the news? Earlier this month UN scientists warned that we only have a dozen years to prevent catastrophic climate change.“Yet rather than investing in a low-carbon economy, the chancellor is gearing up to create more pollution that wrecks our climate and damages our health.“We could be a world leader in building a cleaner, safer future, but government climate policy seems to be stuck in reverse.”More than half of motorists plan to swap diesel for eco-friendly carsSian Berry, co-leader of the Green party, said: “’It’s very disappointing to see this government announce over and over again a ‘new’ roads programme that will just make traffic problems worse.\u0026nbsp“Building new roads just creates new traffic. Real, green investment in our future would boost walking and cycling, green energy and local public transport.”Simon Alcock, of environmental charity ClientEarth, said: “Emergency measures to protect our children from traffic pollution would cost £153m, which is a drop in the ocean compared with the numbers the government is allocating to roads.\u0026nbsp“Ministers seem unwilling to find money to protect children from traffic pollution around schools but are happy to spend billions on roads.”The Treasury said the roads fund would help “make journeys quicker and easier for millions of commuters across the country, while boosting productivity and road safety. Congestion costs UK households over £30 billion every year and the equivalent of more than 100 million working days could be lost, between now and 2040, unless action is taken.”Councils will receive £420m for potholes and repairs and to keep bridges open. A further £150m will help improve local junctions.The government’s Transforming Cities Fund will be extended by £680m to support local transport projects such as cycling networks, new buses and trams.The chancellor is also expected to announce an extra £90m to trial “next-generation” methods of transport, potentially including self-driving shuttle services and electric bikes.RAC spokesman Simon Williams told The Independent: “It’s great news for motorists. We know from research that there has been a big increase in dependency on the car so roads are important for the country.“We found 59 per cent of drivers said they would be very keen to take public transport if it was better, but it’s not as affordable, comfortable or frequent as it should be, and many people in rural areas have not choice of how to get to work.”He said motorists were suffering too much damage to their vehicles from potholes, which also posed a safety risk to others when drivers swerved to avoid the holes.A Treasury spokesman said the government was not boosting roads in isolation but was also improving air quality.He said: “We need to repair our roads and ensure the right roads are in the right places, and it’s part of our mix of strategies.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Campaigners say they are alarmed that the proposal appears to be going ahead despite the lack of a formal public consultation, environmental assessment or parliamentary enquiry.“If given the green light, this development will change the face of England’s countryside forever. Yet no formal assessment of the environmental impact it will have has taken place,” said Paul Miner, head of strategic plans and devolution at CPRE.“Despite costing at least £5.5bn in public money, there has been no formal public consultation around developing the Arc. The lack of debate equates to a major, and troubling, democratic deficit at the heart of the proposals.”Hundreds of thousands urge government to stop fast-tracking frackingGreen MEP for the South East, Keith Taylor, said the study revealed “the terrifying extent of the impact of the Oxford-Cambridge Arc”, and questioned the legality of pushing ahead without consulting with local communities.“It clearer than ever that the project is a monumental disaster and act of environmental sabotage,” he said.Responding to the claims,\u0026nbspan NIC spokesman\u0026nbspsaid: “Our recommendations come with the clear condition that new schemes should not compromise the high-quality natural environment for existing and future residents, and do not need to involve any changes to existing Green Belt protections.“In fact, our report made clear the need for significant investment in landscape improvements, affordable housing and sustainable transport. These changes are vital to make the most of the area’s economic potential and the contribution it makes to the wider UK economy.”CPRE\u0026nbsphas called for a full assessment to be conducted that looks at the impact on people’s health and wellbeing as well as environmental impacts including climate change.Instead of investing in the new expressway, the group called for investment in improved public transport in the region alongside a commitment to building “genuinely affordable homes”.The government is aiming to build 300,000 new homes need to be built each year in England to meet demand, and experts have warned of significant backlogs.Mr Brokenshire said: “The Oxford-Cambridge Arc is an opportunity to further strengthen rural economies, enhance the environment and benefit local communities.“Our new planning rulebook strengthens protections for the Green Belt and\u0026nbspwe have sets out our ambition to ensure housing projects are more environmentally friendly.”Campaign to Protect Rural EnglandShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

I think Brexit is wrong and I think we should stop it altogether.\u0026nbsp“We all think that it is wrong and we think we should remain together.”Jo Law, 31, and her partner Phuong La, 23, came to protest about how Brexit was creating a toxic atmosphere.Ms Law, from south London, said: “I’m here because of my girlfriend. Trying to get a visa for her is just impossible.“It’s all about immigration.”Corinna Lewis, a 37-year-old German student, had travelled from her home in Canterbury to show her support for a Final Say vote, as she was not eligible to vote during the 2016 referendum.She said: “I’ve been in England for 10 years but I couldn’t\u0026nbspvote. I don’t think that’s fair.Broughton speaks at the People’s Vote march in London“I think there are lots of people who are absolutely engaged but were excluded from the vote.”\u0026nbspAlso among the crowds was Lord Of The Rings actor Andy Serkis, who described it as “one of the most, if not the most important march of a generation”.Other famous faces included Sir Bob Geldof, TV presenter Richard Bacon, Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden, comedian Jenny Eclair and Holby City actors Catherine Russell and Hugh Quarshie.Ahead of the march, a Downing Street spokeswoman told The Independent that people had a right to speak out, but that the prime minister had made clear her position in regards to a new referendum.While the protestors gathered, Ms May visited an exhibition in her constituency, entitled Maidenhead And Me, featuring work by local artists.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is only right that they have a say in their nation’s future.”Mr Hutton added: “This careful analysis shows just how badly young people – already disadvantaged by the breakdown of career structures and high housing costs – will be further hit by Brexit.”And Mr\u0026nbspOluwole said: “Now that the implications for our generation have become clear, we need a People’s Vote on the government’s Brexit deal.”The research comes as the Brexit talks remain deadlocked over the issue of the Irish border backstop – with just five months until departure day next March.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Amazon shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in after-hours trading after it reported quarterly sales of $56.58bn (£44.16bn), missing expectations of $57.1bn. Alphabet’s stock fell 4.7 per cent after it posted revenue of $33.74bn, missing Wall Street’s target of $34.04bn, although earnings of $13.06 per share came in well ahead of the expected $10.42 per share. Google reveals it has sacked 48 employees over sexual harassmentGoogle leak reveals plans for censored search engine in ChinaEbay sues Amazon, accusing rival of illegally poaching sellersAmazon wage increase could result in lower pay for some employees“Google’s earnings momentum remains strong,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing. “But if you dig in a little deeper, there are cost pressures which are building up and are mainly responsible for this period’s disappointment.”Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, said the “poorly received” earnings from Alphabet and Amazon had “soured the mood on what had been a rebounding US session”. However, Christopher Rossbach, CIO of investment firm J. Stern \u0026amp Co, said the companies both remain fundamentally strong, despite missing market expectations. “While their revenues were both slightly lower than expected, with Amazon additionally guiding slightly lower than street expectations for the next quarter, they still both show good profitability,” he said. \u0026nbsp“Alphabet is the leader in search and advertising, and Amazon is the leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and increasingly benefits from advertising too. The fundamentals of both companies are intact and we believe that any significant weakness is a buying opportunity for long-term investors.”Other tech stocks that dipped in after-hours include Apple, which fell 1.6 per cent, and Twitter, which was down 2.5 per cent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While campaigning on Tuesday, Irish prime minister\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar outlined his support for the reform.“What we want to have in Ireland is a 21st\u0026nbspCentury constitution for a 21st\u0026nbspCentury republic,” he said. “We’ve already reformed our Constitution to allow for things like marriage equality, women’s right to choose.“We believe that having a criminal offence for blasphemy in Ireland is a bit outdated so we’re asking people to change that. It’s very much part of a reform of our whole Constitution to make the country more modern.”Created with Sketch. Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A referendum on the matter, which is required in order to change the constitution, was first mooted as far back as 2009.Attention was drawn again in 2017 after Stephen Fry made an appearance on the RTE programme The Meaning of Life, in which he described God as “capricious, mean-minded and stupid”.At the time, police in Ireland confirmed they were looking into the comments, but eventually dropped the matter, as they were “unable to find a substantial number of outraged people”.MPs back bid to reform Northern Ireland abortion and marriage lawsIt was later decided that the referendum would be held this year, although there has been very little campaigning around it, with just one major radio debate.This is in part because Friday’s vote was held concurrently with Ireland’s presidential election, in which the incumbent Michael D Higgins was re-elected.Although this referendum has been more low key than the previous votes on same sex marriage and abortion, it does add to a pattern of social change in Ireland, and highlights the growing distance between church and state, in a country over which the Catholic church once held firm control.A 2017 report from the US Commission on International Religious Freedom found that 71 countries have laws which criminalise blasphemy.According to a 2016 study by the Freedom of Thought report, the offence is punishable by death in six countries: Afghanistan, Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.England and Wales abolished blasphemy as an offence in 2008, but it is still ingrained in law in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Surveys in recent weeks suggested he enjoyed the support of around two-thirds of the electorate.But the real surprise of this election result has been the performance of runner up Peter Casey, who took 23.1 per cent of the vote.Mr\u0026nbsp Casey is a Derry-born businessman now based in the US, who has starred as an investor on the Irish version of Dragon’s Den. He was an outsider candidate polling just 1 per cent\u0026nbspin polls published last week.However, his campaign took a turn at the weekend after he made controversial comments about the travelling community in Ireland, who he claimed were “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.While it initially appeared the comments might derail his campaign, instead it appears to have drawn a fifth of voters to his camp. In the past, Mr Casey has also criticised Ireland as a welfare state, suggested the country should abandon its historic neutrality, and has also criticised its relationship with the EU.Among the losers in this election are Sinn Fein, who were hoping that their candidate Liadh Ni Riada could provide a fresh alternative to\u0026nbspMr Higgins, but she came in third place.\u0026nbspThe party has failed to match the 13 per cent of the vote earned by Martin McGuinness at the last election, with early results indicating many of the party’s supporters voted for Mr Higgins, or Mr Casey.The result will also be disappointing for Sean Gallagher, another businessman who came second in the 2011 election, but has now seen his support base collapse. The other two candidates, Joan Freeman and Gavin Duffy, earned low results, predicted by the polls.Created with Sketch.

But polls showed that while the majority of people wanted him back for a second term, most people also wanted to see a campaign.Mr Higgins stood with the support of the main Fine Gael and Fianna Fail parties, and commanded support across the political spectrum.A veteran Irish politician, Mr Higgins was a lifelong member of the Labour party. He has served as a mayor, a senator, a TD in the Irish parliament, and was minister for culture in the 1990s. During this period he helped set up the first Irish language TV station TG4, being a fluent speaker himself. He also has a background in academia and is respected as a published poet.A natural statesman, Mr Higgins has been praised for his ability to reach out across all sections of Irish society, his handling of difficult anniversaries in the past decade, and for how he represents Ireland on the world stage.He has achieved a rare feat in Ireland by becoming a somewhat beloved politician – something which is easier to carry in the largely ceremonial role of the presidency, which is above party politics.But he did come in for criticism during this campaign – particularly from Mr Casey – over the cost of the presidency, his use of expenses and how transparent this was to the taxpayer. None of this damaged Mr Higgins’ reputation personally, but it is likely he will push for some reform of the office during this second term.The Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but the office holder does occupy a unique space which can both set and respond to the mood of the nation.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0026rsquos about looking at where people want to live their lives, rather than telling them where they should live.According to Treasury figures, for every \u0026pound1 spent on roads, the economy gets \u0026pound7 back, promising a \u0026pound210billion economic boost.Sources admit, however, that the move was born of an urgent need to cut congestion, currently costing more than \u0026pound30billion a year.A Treasury official said: \u0026ldquoThe equivalent of more than 100 million working days could be lost between now and 2040 unless action is taken.Brexit news: Jacob Rees-Mogg praised the Chancellor\u0027s infrastructure plans (Image:  IMAGES)Philip Hammond is due to unveil massive investment in the UK\u0027s roads (Image: PA)                Brexit TAX BOOST: Hammond set to slash income tax after EU exit                Inside Politics: Will Phil give us a trick or treat Budget?Highways England, already operating \u0026pound2.8billion over budget, will be given a 40 per cent cash boost as part of a \u0026pound28.8billion fund for strategically important roads such as motorways and major routes.It will see new roads linking motorways to towns and improved and faster-flowing rural routes.Schemes already earmarked include broadening the A303 which serves the West Country, and improving the busy M1-M62 junction in West Yorkshire.In a popular move for Britain\u0026rsquos 38 million motorists, Mr Hammond will also confirm Vehicle Excise Duty funds will be ring-fenced exclusively for roads from 2020.Councils will receive an additional \u0026pound480million allocated to fix potholes, repair damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open. That is on top of the annual \u0026pound1billion highways maintenance budget and recent \u0026pound300million potholes fund.A further \u0026pound150million will be spent on improving local junctions.The Transforming Cities Fund will receive an extra \u0026pound680million to support priorities such as the Greater Manchester cycling networks, the West Midlands\u0026rsquo  extension at Brierley Hill and more public transport basics such as new buses and trams.An additional \u0026pound90million will go on trialling next-generation transport such as electric bikes and self-driving shuttle buses, sources say.Philip Hammond\u0027s Budget will aim to unite Britain after Brexit (Image: REUTERS)                SNP politician openly admits existence of MEP PLOT to thwart Brexit                Brexiteer MEP demands EU citizens \u0027PATRIOTIC COMMITMENT\u0027 to voteBritish Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said: \u0026ldquoNow is the time to tell business that the Government is serious about helping firms navigate Brexit and prepare for change.\u0026ldquoBetter productivity, skills and connectivity are all things that the Government must invest in alongside business, regardless of the eventual Brexit deal.Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoThe Treasury remains the last Remainer bastion in Whitehall, and certainly these plans for our road infrastructure bode well for our post-Brexit future.Citing three areas he hoped Mr Hammond would address to further Britain\u0026rsquos Brexit chances, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Chancellor must announce no tariffs on any goods that the UK doesn\u0026rsquot produce itself on March 29, so we stop protecting an inefficient continental system.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to see VAT rates imposed by the EU on domestic fuel, women\u0026rsquos sanitary products and energy efficient products scrapped.\u0026ldquoFinally, we must show we\u0026rsquore open for business internationally by taking stamp duty back to 2010 levels, to encourage people to invest in the UK from abroad.Ex-transport secretary John Redwood agreed and said he would also like to see VAT on domestic fuels abolished.\u0026ldquoFuel is expensive, and hits those on lower incomes particularly hard, he said.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But I’m happy to tell Sun on Sunday readers that their hard work is paying off.Our jobs market has defied many of the naysayers.Near record numbers of people have a job and unemployment has fallen in every region across the country.There are more than .million additional people in work since .While this is a huge achievement, sometimes it’s easy to forget that behind these numbers are thousands of people up and down our country who are now better able to provide for their families.They can get up every morning knowing they have the security that only a job can bring.And what’s more, they are being rewarded with a pay rise — this month’s figures show the strongest wage growth in almost a decade.Contrary to myths peddled by the opposition, it’s people at the bottom of the pay scale who have benefited most.The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest rise in pay thanks to our National Living Wage and the proportion of low-paid jobs is at a record low.Tomorrow I will deliver my Budget, where I will show how our careful focus on fixing the economy is bearing fruit.Thanks to the balanced approach we have taken — getting our debt falling, while keeping taxes low — and the hard work of the people of the UK, I will be able to set out how we will be investing in our future.Much of the talk surrounding Budgets is often technical. Many, many experts and commentators will have their own take on how the economy is doing.While this is, of course, important, what most ordinary people really care about is how the Budget will improve their day-to-day lives.And one of the issues which I know Sun on Sunday readers care a lot about is transport. With a thousand more people moving into work every day, it’s important that we help to get them there on time.Many of you preparing to start the working week tomorrow will know the frustration of having your journey to work ruined by delays caused by poorly maintained roads. Or of having your car or van damaged by potholes.This isn’t just a bad way to start the day, it’s bad for businesses large and small, and it can be really damaging to the wider economy as well.It’s estimated that congestion costs UK households more than £billion every year. That’s why tomorrow I will announce a bumper £billion investment in our country’s transport network — including a new £.billion fund ring-fencing vehicle excise duty raised in England for spending on our roads.As a former Transport Secretary, I know that these are the arteries that keep our country alive – and they need taking care of. Thirty-two years ago tomorrow, Margaret Thatcher officially opened the final stretch of the M.While few would claim to love this motorway, it’s easy to forget what a landmark moment this was for our country’s transport infrastructure. Three decades later, I am committed to honouring that legacy.And as important as our major roads are, smaller local roads are just as vital to our everyday lives.That’s why I will also announce tomorrow £million of immediate cash for councils to maintain and improve local roads — fixing potholes, repairing damaged roads and keeping bridges safe and open.A further £million on top of that will help improve local junctions, allowing better access to workplaces, high streets and other community facilities.This is also part of our commitment to bridging the gap between our regions. Those in rural parts of the country should have the same chances to get on in le and not have poor transport connections limiting their potential.The funding will help make journeys quicker and easier, while boosting productivity and improving access.And because I know that not everyone drives, I will also invest in local transport projects which could include new bus, tram and cycling routes.And I will also look to the future by investing in next-generation methods of transport, which could potentially include self-driving shuttle services.Not only could this revolutionise our transport network, it will also help us become a global leader developing future technologies.And finally, as I earlier announced with the Prime Minister, I am happy to confirm we will also be freezing fuel duty, for the ninth year in a row.This will keep the cost of fuel down for millions of drivers across the UK — saving people around £million this year alone.These measures are only possible due to our careful management of the economy over the past few years — and the hard work of the British people.This country has a bright future ahead, and — thanks to this vital investment package — the journey there just got a bit smoother.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was extremely shocked and offended. He was saying ‘come on’ until I escaped into a taxi.“He was tipsy, but I felt he wasn’t joking. It was disgraceful. I have sex with who I want to, when I decide, for my pleasure.“But this man seems to think that with money and power he can buy anything.“He had no sense of the frustration and humiliation that he was creating.“Some people might have been able to laugh it off or dismiss it as a joke. But as a woman I just couldn’t do that.”Indecent Proposal, which also stars Woody Harrelson, sees Redford play a billionaire who offers a struggling couple million to spend a night with the we, played by Moore.Nancy, a Strictly Come Dancing contestant in , was enjoying a night out with two of her pals at the Mayfair nightclub.Green, who runs the Arcadia group, was at a nearby table and is said to have sent over a bottle of Dom Perignon champagne.Nancy said that when she went over at the end of the night to thank him, Green insisted she join him for a drink then put his arm around her waist.She went on: “I could feel his hand, so I removed it.“After that I left the table and my friends and I left the club.“We were outside waiting for a taxi when Philip came out and approached me.“I tried to react, but I was so shocked — as my friends were too.“I looked at him, and I said ‘I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear you’. I tried to laugh it off.”“But he didn’t seem to want to take no for an answer, until I moved his hand away and left him standing in the street.“I still find it shocking, the things he seemed to have in mind.“I had the impression that he was treating me as nothing more than some kind of prostitute.”Nancy, who split from ex-England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson in , first met Green through mutual friends in . Their paths then often crossed at the same ­parties in London.But Nancy said Green made her uncomfortable from the start by seizing any opportunity to lavish her with gushing compliments.Nancy said: “I know the dference between a gentle, kind compliment and someone being overly forward — and Philip was the kind of man who could be like that.“Things always seemed to have a double meaning, always an insinuation there beneath the surface. He would say I was beautul, sexy, hot. There would be lots of compliments about what I was wearing and how I looked.“He was arrogant and had a real attitude. He comes across as an unpleasant man and I felt uncomfortable from the start.“He was also one of those men who seems to need to be tactile with you. He is the sort of man that behaves better when his we was around. But at these parties people are always moving around, so those men can always find a way to try to get close to you.”After the night at Annabel’s, Nancy told how she went out of her way to avoid Green when she saw him on the party scene.But they met again at the ­wedding of former Neighbours star Holly Valance and property developer Nick Candy in .Nancy said: “He looked embarrassed when he saw me, but he never apologised or said anything about that night.“He made me so uncomfortable that after that I did everything I could to stay away from him.”Green yesterday went for a hike in stling heat near his £.million US ranch in Tucson, Arizona.He later played tennis with a pal.Quizzed on allegations of bullying and harassment, Green told a reporter: “I’ve made a statement. Go and read it, can you read ”His head of security Bill Richards — an ex-police commander — then stepped in to usher him away.Afterwards Mr Richards told the Press: “How’s Sir Philip doing “You don’t get to be a man of his stature without a certain amount of resiliency, correct ”Italian lawyer Nancy was with football boss Eriksson for nearly ten years.The Swede repeatedly cheated on her with a string of women, including telly presenter Ulrika Jonsson and his FA secretary Faria Alam.Nancy also told The Sun on Sunday how she has experienced sexual harassment since she was at university.She said: “I’ve expected to go in a business meeting and realised that the person I’m meeting is only interested in having sex with me — or trying to.“One man went into the bathroom during a so-called meeting and came back naked.“Another showed me how excited he was by me. The worst thing about it is it makes you feel powerless to react because you’re shocked.“I like being in control, and things like that make you feel disorientated, it’s frustrating. I’ve wanted to speak out about my experiences for a long time, but until now women have never supported each other in coming out and speaking about harassment.“But they are now, and I hope this means the lack of respect between men and women that has existed forever starts to ­disappear.“Women having courage and speaking out can only be a good thing and I hope more women find the courage to speak.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was the same when Charles and Diana went to Australia and it was also their first large overseas tour.Charles and Diana used to look at each other just like Harry and Meghan do now — in a very adoring way.On one occasion, Charles put his hand on Diana’s and the way they looked at each other, you knew that it was a magical time. I have seen that here with Harry and Meghan.Meghan has had a brilliant tour and done really well. She has worn some great clothes, even though one day she left the label on!She’s been smiling all the way through. Royal tours are not easy and you have to put your best face on.She has done tremendously well. At one stage, Meghan felt a little unwell with the pregnancy and took a break, which was sensible.I have been smitten with Meghan.Every job I have done with her she has been absolutely brilliant. I can’t speak highly enough of her.It is a tough gig becoming a member of the Royal Family and there are a lot of things to take on — the primary one is duty. And when Meghan takes on patronages of her own, I think she will really shine and do a wonderful job.AFTER arriving in Sydney on Monday, October , and announcing their pregnancy hours later, the first day of the official tour began on Tuesday.Having hugged fans at the Opera House, Meg received her first baby gt, a toy kangaroo, from Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove.The following day Meghan met a farming family in drought-hit Dubbo, west of Sydney – then on Day  it was on to Melbourne.The Duchess of Sussex can do no wrong with her slick American look.Her Tour-drobe is a lesson to us all in how to put together a classic working wardrobe, but with a sexy spin.She has stuck to a minimal colour palette of black, beige, navy, cobalt blue and white and has chosen a number of amazing Australian, Kiwi, American and British designers that are all also available and well known in the UK.Her wardrobe can easily be mixed, matched and re-spun, which makes it as hard working as she is.Meghan definitely knows what suits her and with help of her stylist and best friend, Canadian Jessica Mulroney, who is travelling with her in an unofficial capacity she hasn’t put a Tabitha Simmons-shod foot wrong.The white column dress by Theia that she wore to the official welcome reception in Tonga is just so simple and chic with the small split and embellished shoulders.Bucks royal trends and does own thingAnd the cape-back blue Safiyaa dress in Fiji was the perfect choice to give us the first proper glimpse of Meghan’s bump. Even better, it was in a shade called Fiji blue.Watching her maternity wardrobe develop as that bump visibly grew throughout the tour was a thrill.And on Friday night — Day  of the tour, when she might have been expected to be flagging fashion-wise — she still managed to pull out an absolute show-stopper.For an event to present conservation awards, she wore a dress by Oscar de la Renta which featured birds all the way from the base to the bodice. Perfect.What I love about Meghan is that she bucks the royal trends and totally does her own thing.She is a modern woman who has entered into the Royal Family and given it her own special bit of sass.Her dress code is still in keeping with the royals but her look is unique and she isn’t prepared to compromise that. I also love that she endorses sustainable and ethical brands like Outland denim and Veja trainers.Go Meghan — you are not only strong and stylish but well on your way to becoming a fashion icon. Princess Diana would have been very proud. They later laid a wreath at the city’s Anzac memorial to honour Australia’s heroes of the First World War.The trip finally took its toll on day six when, after chatting to children at the Olympic Park, Meghan pulled out of hosting other events due to exhaustion.By Ingrid SewardEditor-in-chief of Majesty MagazineWHEN the Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived in Australia to announce Meghan was expecting a baby, they were on to a winner.Australians have always loved Prince Harry and now they wanted to love Meghan too.She was not going to let them down despite the fatigue that comes with jet lag and her pregnancy.She wanted to give them her best and be the best.If that meant getting up at .am Australia time to do yoga to “refresh her mind” she did it.No one was going to stop this strong American woman who wowed crowds with her panache.All she wanted inwas to be able to hold Harry’s hand for reassurance, which she did.So much so the media named it the tour of PDAs .When The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge made their first joint tour in April , they had young Prince George to deflect some of the attention, but it was equally exhausting.But Meghan was never going to let fatigue get her down and only once in an overcrowded market in Fiji did she falter as the crowd control burst and she had to be hurried back to her car.Otherwise she behaved like the actress she is and her big smile never wavered.In the drought-stricken town of Dubbo, miles west of Sydney, it poured with much-needed rain on their visit.Meghan held an umbrella over her husband’s head when he spoke — he had given his to a lady in the crowd.The couple hugged children, talked to old ladies, and all the time promoted youth leadership, mental health, conservation and, of course, the Invictus Games.There was also the oddest royal engagement in history when the couple sat in a semi-circle in the sand of Sydney’s Bondi Beach wearing garlands of flowers and talking about mental health issues with surfers.This “anti bad-vibe circle” was to promote positive thinking and even in their jet-lagged state Meghan and Harry never let their smiles slip.In Tonga they had an audience with the king and queen and a state banquet. Crowds lined every route — once for ten miles.Although Meghan gave two speeches, the first on women’s empowerment at the University of The South Pacic in Fiji and another at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games in Sydney, she never stole Harry’s thunder. They were a couple from start to finish.It was a truly dferent royal tour — maybe more Hollywood than Highgrove, but this is their way and everybody loved them.She later left fans disappointed on a solo outing to a market after being whisked away by security. Next up, the Duke and Duchess flew to Tonga, with Meg forgetting to cut the label off her £ dress.The couple then flew back to Sydney to be guests of honour at the Australian Geographic Society gala at the Shangri-La hotel.As they left the venue, Meghan was spotted clutching a toy wombat that she had been given for her unborn baby.She was also given a cuddly numbat – a small marsupial from Western Australia.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows the strength and resilience of the UK economy alongside the efforts and hard work of families and households up and down the country.In conventional times voters might rightly expect the result of this to be lower taxes , more investment in our public services or to see progress in us paying off the ever ballooning national debt.Instead the Government is preparing to blow this cash - your money - by giving into even more of the EU’s demands.Until last week, Britain expected a  month “transition” or “implementation” period after we formally leave the EU next year on March , .Then, late last week the Government shocked everyone by proposing that we stay in the EU longer than we were originally told and that we extend the so called ‘negotiating period’ to leave the EU.Worse still, on Monday in the House of Commons, we were told that this transition period might last until June  – that’s six years after the referendum result. Whatever happened to Brexit means Brexit On top of our extended membership of the EU, we can expect a bill from the EU! That’s right more of your money with an extra price tag of approximately £ billion each year in contributions to the EU.The Treasury has budgeted for this until the end of  but for each year after , the cost will be as high as £ billion because we will have lost the £. billion a year rebate which was famously secured and successfully negotiated in  by Margaret Thatcher when she demanded our money back from the EU.The British people are once again being treated like fools. What we are now witnessing is a blatant attempt to keep Britain in the EU while Brussels continues to raid the pockets of British taxpayers.This must end and the Government should invoke the great Thatcherite spirit of Fontainebleau and say No, No, No to Brussels. Because pumping our money into an undemocratic and unaccountable system two years after Britain voted to leave the EU is simply not right or acceptable. It makes a mockery of our democracy and is an insult to the British public.It is our money and that money should be handed back to the people and communities across the UK to invest in our domestic priorities.It could help people across Britain– especially the least well off – by giving them back more of the money that they earn by cutting their taxes.For example,we cut the basic rate of income tax by a penny, that would cost us £ billion.By increasing the personal allowance by a £,, many more of the poorest paid households would be taken out of tax altogether, that’d cost us £. billion. Andwe cut beer and cider duty by  pence, that would cost us £. billion.So by easing the tax burden for the lowest paid and doing our bit to save British pubs from closing, we’d have invested £ billion into longer term economic growth in our economy.And with the other £ billion  How about supporting the millions of families who want to own their own home by cutting stamp duty for homeowners, we can again help the least well off and give them a hand up and support them in their aspirations to own their home.We could also take more first time buyers out of paying stamp duty altogether  If we raised the starting threshold of £, to £,, this would cost the Treasury £. billion.Then there’s the VAT we pay on domestic gas and electricity. The  per cent VAT charge on domestic fuel and power raised around £. billion in  . If we got rid of this we would make fuel cheaper and families would have a little extra left over in their monthly pay packets.What about the VAT charged on sanitary products for women  This should end now and not when we leave the EU s the Government previously promised, especially as leaving the EU will take longer than we were previously promised. VAT receipts from the sale of sanitary products costs approximately £. billion a year but importantly this one VAT cut that would unite women across the country.I could go on. There are so many important domestic key services and priorities to invest in.To govern is to choose and the choice being made our Government is to spend your money on an expensive and everlasting EU membership.And all this comes on top of the ridiculous capitulation where we have agreed to the EU’s demands to hand over a £ billion pay cheque for absolutely nothing in .Britain needs once again to have a long term economic plan that puts our national interest first.Let’s start standing up for Britain by investing in people, businesses and communities rather than the unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats of the European Union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now prepare for a new sting in your tail for those family arguments - after a poll claimed the British public have been getting Brexit all wrong. Pollsters Ipsos MORI, Kings College London and the UK in a Changing Europe think tank surveyed , British adults on misperceptions that helped fuelled the vote to Leave. Today they announced their findings - and say its common for people to believe things which the independent Migration Advisory Committeesaid are simply not true. From crime and unemployment to the infamous poundmillion-a-week Brexit bus, here are some commonly-held myths that dont quite stand up to reality. . No, EU immigrants dont take more than they give  What the poll found: % of people thought European immigrants either pay in the same amount, or less, in taxes than they receive in welfare benefits and public services. For Leave voters the figure was %, for Remain voters it was %. What the MAC said: Migrants from the European Economic Areain   paid pound.bn more in taxes than they received in benefits and services. The average EEA migrant also paid in pound, more than the average UK national. . No, EU immigration doesnt cause soaring crime  What the poll found: % of people thought European immigration had increased crime, rising to % of Leave voters . What the MAC said: We found that migration does not impact crime and there is no evidence to suggest that migrants are linked to any increases in crime in England and Wales. . No, EU immigration hasnt fuelled unemployment  What the poll found: % of people thought European immigration has increased unemployment among lower-skilled workers. This rose to % for Leave voters or was % for Remain voters. What the MAC said: Migrants have no or little impact on the overall employment and unemployment outcomes of the UK-born workforce. The impact may y across dferent UK-born groups with more negative effects for the lower-skilled and more positive effects for the higher-skilled. However, our robustness checks suggest that these findings are subject to uncertainty. . No, a sixth of UK residents arent from the EU  What the poll found: People were asked to guess what percentage of UK residents were born in another EU state. The average guess was % - % for Leave voters, % for Remain voters. The facts: Around .million UK residents are citizens of another EU country, about %. . No, we dont send poundm a week to the EU. What the poll found: % of people thought the UK sends poundm a week to the EU. This rose to % for Tory Leave voters and % for Labour Leave voters. . The facts: Britain made a net contribution to Brussels budget of pound million a week in   - the lowest level for five years. Much of the dference is thanks to a rebate which Britain never actually has to hand over. More on this here. But its not all bad news  The research found that on some issues, the public were much closer to the mark. People guessed % of UK exports go to EU countries, close to the actual figure of %. Around % said immigration has increased house prices, a claim backed by the MAC report . And they correctly guessed immigration had little impact on high-skilled unemployment. What the authors say Prof Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at KCL, said: These misperceptions are not all about us being misled or our own ignorance of the facts – they are more emotional than that. We exaggerate what we worry about, so what we get wrong is as much a reflection of our concerns.Attempting to change people’s views of Brexit just with a more evidence-based description won’t be enough, and misses a large part of the point. The hugely ied views of these realities lay bare how dferently dferent groups of the population see our relationship with the EU, and how ingrained and dficult it will be to find common ground.

The Chancellor will unveil plans in his Budget on Monday to pair up with banks and debt charities to run the scheme. They will get poundmillion of Whitehall cash to help them design no cost repayment plans to defeat the loan sharks. A similar scheme in Australia has enabled four in five borrowers to ditch their payday lenders. A Treasury source said: “This will help people take greater control of their finances by offering more affordable alternatives.”  Mr Hammond will also extend the six weeks “breathing space” to three months before creditors can take action against debtors. The changes were welcomed by MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis, but he said the only disappointment was the y timetable - with no concrete policy announced yet. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: This is farcical from a Government that has overseen the expansion of high-cost problem credit on an industrial scale. And whose flagship social security policy, Universal Credit, is driving low-income households into debt. In a feelgood Budget designed to soften Britain up for Brexit the Chancellor is also expected to bring forward the pound, tax free allowance from  to April next year.  This pound extra will give all  million taxpayers a break from the moment we leave the EU. Thresholds for higher rate payers will rise to pound,.

Chancellor Philip Hammond has been forced to hint at more cash in tomorrows Budget after a triple whammy of warnings about the six-in-one benefit. First, more than  Tory backbenchers launched a last-ditch plea to raise the work allowance - the amount people can earn before their benefits are cut off. They urged the Chancellor to cut the five-week wait for payment, writing: Expecting families with nothing to wait for five weeks does not fit with Conservative values. Their plea was joined by ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis who warned welfare cuts have gone too far and said: The Chancellor has to put at least poundbillion back into Universal Credit or risk crippling one of the most necessary reforms in modern Britain. Second, Parliaments cross-party Work and Pensions Committee warned the ‘Universal Support’ scheme - which is offered to claimants transferring to UC - was woefully inadequate and risked undermining the whole project. And third, research by the Observer today found welfare reforms are fuelling a rise in homelessness.  Mr Hammond today hinted at more cash for the benefit in tomorrows Budget, telling Sky News: Well we continue to look at how this process is working. If we find clf edges and dficulties, frictions in the move from the old benefits system to Universal Credit then of course will always try to smooth those out and be pragmatic about it. Askedpeople will be pound a month worse off - as Tory welfare chief Esther McVey admitted - Mr Hammond told the BBC: I would hope not. My aspiration would be to try to smooth this process so people are able to take advantage of the incentives Universal Credit gives them to work a few more hours, to earn a bit more money. I’m prepared to look at this from a very pragmatic point of view.  Tory Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss added: We are listening very carefully to what our colleagues have to say… we want this system to work. But helping people who move from the old system will do nothing to ease the pain of million new claimants who are set to be on UC by December . Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell accused Mr Hammond of callous complacency and demanded he halt the rollout entirely - or face having his Budget voted down.  The Labour figure said: Im saying to other political parties thathe doesnt halt the roll-out of Universal Credit weve got to vote this Budget down, weve got to stop him forcing people into poverty in this way. Universal Credit will come forward for a separate Commons vote in the coming months - and one Tory MP suggested she could vote it down. Justine Greening told Sky News: I think it’s going to be hard for many of us who are concerned about how this will play out in our local communities to support it without the changes it needs to be successful.”  In a report today, the Work and Pensions Committee said the DWPs system ofuniversal support which is supposed to help claimants adapt to UC fell far short of what was needed. Vulnerable people need more than the current single two-hour session of personal budgeting and digital skill support, MPs said. Committee chairman Frank Field said: Universal support is not universal, and it hasnt been offering much in the way of support. DWP must not push one more claimant on to Universal Credit until it can show that it will not push them over the edge. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Meanwhile a homeless shelter told The Observer Universal Credit was a factor in a third of its clients ending up in its care. Annie Welling of the Sea View homeless charity in Hastings added: Weve seen a sharp increase in street homelessness. In the first three months of this year we veried  dferent iniduals. On any given day were seeing  people rough sleeping now. Last year it was more like . It comes just days after MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee accused the Department of Work and Pensionsof turning a deaf ear to the concerns of claimants facing unacceptable levels of hardship. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey insisted the system - which is intended to ensure work always pays - was helping the jobless into employment, but acknowledged there was a need to adapt and change.

A Sunday People investigation has discovered that: Facebook has NO age verication checks in place for users buying dangerous knives Vendors are given NO warning that they will be breaking the lawthey flog blades to buyers under . Buy-one-get-one free discounts are offered to children as young as . One seller offers to deliver knives at the school gates.  Tonight senior politicians blasted Facebook – which is used by two-thirds of - year olds – and other online shygiants for allowing the scandal. And families of children and teachers killed by pupils armed with knives called for action by Facebook which made over poundbillion profit last year. Dr Mark Prince, whose -year-old son Kiyan was stabbed to death at his school gates, said of our harrowing findings: “It feels like we’re being ignored and our pain is being ignored. Nothing is really being done.” During our investigation, we found sellers on Facebook were failing to very that buyers were over  before sale shydespite it being a legal requirement. At no point in the buying process for a number of blades up to .cm were our investigators asked for identication or confirmation of their age.  And when we contacted sellers to shyarrange sales, we found that not one Facebook user refused to sell their knives after learning that the buyer was still at school. One seller even offered to deliver knives to a school premises during lunch break. Within minutes of logging on to the site, we were able to message the shyvendor, who shyoffered to drive to the school gates in person to hand over the weapons. The set of four knives was on offer for pound with same day delivery. When we shyenquired about their location in shyrelation to a local school, they said: “You in school shytoday  What time u on break or lunch ” He continued: “I need to leave b pm today so b would be good. What abtI pop over to u on break ” Another seller offered three .cm knives for the price of one when we askedhe could give a discount. Our findings will horry teachers and parents. Pupils and school staff continue to fall victim to kne-wielding pupils. School welfare officer Joy Simon, , was stabbed in the face by a -year-old girl at Winterton Community Academy near Scunthorpe, Lincs, last September.  Teacher Vincent Uzomah, , was stabbed in the stomach by a -year-old pupil in a racist attack at a school in Bradford, West Yorks, three years ago. Ann Maguire, , was shymurdered by a -year-old kne-wielding pupil in her classroom in Leeds in . And headmaster Philip Lawrence, , was kned to death when he tried to stop a pupil being attacked at the school gates by a gang in . Labour MP Stephen Timms, who was stabbed in the stomach by a -year-old student at his constituency office in , slammed Facebook for failing to join the battle against youth kne crime. The London East Ham MP, whose borough suffered the highest murder rate in the shycapital last year, said: “Online s show little restraint in selling knives to young people.  “Knives that are banned in the UK can be bought online without dficulty. “I’ve tabled an amendment to the government’s Offensive Weapons Bill to make it an offence for UK websites to offer banned weapons.” Patrick Green, head of the Ben Kinsella Trust which is named after the innocent -year-old stabbed to death in Islington, North London, ten years ago, urged Facebook to stop selling the knives immediately. He said: “Kne crime is one of the most signicant issues in England and Wales. “Facebook has a corporate and shymoral responsibility to ensure it keeps people safe. “I wouldn’t have thought that a company like this would like to risk being seen as a shyloophole that allows young people to buy knives.” Labour MP Louise Haigh, the shadow policing and crime minister, wants to ensure that the Offensive Weapons Bill shytargets sellers on outlets including Facebook Marketplace.  She added: “Platforms such as Wish, eBay, Facebook Marketplace and Amazon prolerate the use of shyhorrendous weapons.” Speaking to the Sunday People, the Sheffield Heeley MP said: “Platforms cannot continue to duck their responsibilities. “They need to get a grip and ert just a small fraction of their enormous profits to shyintroducing proper age shyverication technology.” Almost  people have been stabbed to death in Britain this year – many in London. Nationally, the total shynumber of offences shyinvolving a kne or bladed instrument recorded by police in the year to March rose to ,, a seven-year high. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has promised to crack down on web giants selling knives online. Knives ordered online will have to be collected from a non-residential address such as a shop and buyers must show ID. But action is slow.  And selling apps like Facebook Marketplace, Schpock and Freecycle appear to be going unchecked. Shocking police data this week revealed the number of weapons shyconfiscated from primary and secondary schools has more than doubled within three years. Over , offensive weapons were removed from children’s possession with knives being the most common. The true figure is believed to be much higher as  of the UK’s  police forces, including London’s politan Police, failed to provide data when asked. A Facebook spokesman said shytoday: “Making sure people have a safe and positive experience on Facebook is our number one shypriority, which is why we use automation technology to help us identy items that may violate our policies. “We do not allow the sale of non-culinary knives on Marketplace and work quickly to shyremove an item like this when we become aware. “We also encourage our shycommunity to report any accounts or items that they feel don’t belong on Facebook, including sellers who they believe aren’t acting in good faith.” Scared by easy accessFormer gang member Chris Preddie, who has been awarded the OBE for his work with young offenders, said the availability of knives on Facebook is “very, very, frightening.”  Chris, , abandoned drug-dealing and turned his le around after his half-brother Andrew was shot dead in Brixton, South London. His cousins Danny and Ricky Preddie were jailed for stabbing Damilola Taylor, , to death in Peckham, South London, in .  Chris, who now supports young people through his charity Make Dreams a Reality, said: “When I went on to Facebook Marketplace last night and typed in ‘knives’, a whole load of stuff came up. “It’s very, very frightening for me and we need to start knocking on some of these bigger doors like Amazon, eBay and Facebook to make sure that we are making our communities safe.” Our pain goes on Pupil Kiyan Prince was stabbed to death outside his school gates at the age of  after trying to stop another pupil being bullied.  Now his dad Dr Mark Prince is an ardent anti-kne crime campaigner who spends his days talking to schoolchildren. After his son’s death at the London Academy in , he set up the Kiyan Prince Foundation to help educate young people about the consequences of kne crime. After our investigation into kne sales on Facebook he warned thatthis is allowed to carry on there will be more cases like his son’s. He said: “The pain I have felt at seeing so many more young people being killed over the last two years is unbelievable. “Facebook needs to focus on the consequences of their decision to allow people to sell knives on their site. “They need to ensure that they prevent young people from getting knives from Facebook.” Mark added: “We’re being ignored and our pain is ignored. Nothing is really being done.” "},{"url":null,"title":"desolate sir philip green strolls","story":"NewsDesolate Sir Philip Green strolls alone through US desert after celeb pals abandon himGreen, , braved the C heat to hike in Arizona’s Sabino Canyon after his sexual and racist harassment allegations came to lightShareByChristopher Bucktin:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsShamed Sir Philip Green has been spied walking by himself through Arizona in boiling heat \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSir Philip Green cuts a solitary figure in the wilderness amid sexual and racial harassment claims.

His we Tina and daughter Chloe have not been seen since it emerged that he spent pound, on an injunction to prevent claims by employees being made public.

Yesterday there was no sign of Green’s family at his pound.million home on the Canyon Ranch Wellness Resort. When the Sunday Mirror approached him he refused to add to his earlier statement in which he denied the claims, simply saying: “Are you enjoying the day  Have a nice day.”  Asked how the tycoon was bearing up, his head of US security Bill Richards, an ex-police commander, said: “I think when you get to be successful as Sir Philip, you have to be pretty robust.” Green flew to his Arizona pad on his poundmillion Gulfstream jet hours before news of his injunction broke. The Topshop owner was identied on Thursday by Lord Peter Hain, the former Labour cabinet minister, after two days of speculation over the name of the man behind the injunction.  Green said he would lodge a formal complaint against Hain with the House of Lords. “As many people have said, Lord Hain’s blatant disregard of a judgment made by three senior judges is outrageous,” he said in a statement. His we Tina controls the couple’s estimated poundbillion fortune and all the family’s shares in Jersey-based Taveta Investments. She is said to be helping plan Chloe’s wedding to ‘hot felon’ Jeremy Meeks – thought to be a poundmillion week-long affair in French Polynesia.

Steve Turley was served an enforcement notice by the Forest of Dean District Council last year which demanded he bulldoze his makesht house, extended outbuildings and a static caravan. Mr Turley appealed the ruling, but a planning inspector has now backed the council. He began construction of the property in near Lydney, Gloucestershire, after he sold his six-bedroom house for pound, three years ago, reports Gloucestershire Live. The house was put on the market with no onward chain and sold, without the land which is on the opposite side of the road.  A complaint was made to the council which informed them that members of his family were living on the land in an unauthorised bedroom bungalow and caravan hidden behind high walls and hedges. Mr Turley argued it was permitted development but the council officials said the location was unsustainable. A council spokesperson said: Mr Steve Turley constructed a dwelling on the site and extended outbuildings without planning permission.  Forest of Dean District Council served an enforcement notice in December , instructing him to restore the site to its original condition before the planning breach took place, cease the use of the land for residential purposes, remove the static caravan, portable building and demolish the dwelling and concrete hard standings at the site. Mr Turley appealed the notice. While the inspector acknowledged that the instruction to remove the hard standings was excessive, he upheld the Councils other requests for demolition. Philip Burford, the chairman of the planning committee, said: This decision serves as a warning to anyone who decides to ignore the planning process and the message is clear: dont spend a considerable amount of money and time on a building project in the knowledge that it does not have planning permission.

And that knowledge will comfort her forever. “I had no idea,” I said after reading the piece. “Well, it’s not something that comes up in conversation,” she replied.

It has not yet issued its winter forecast. The Weather Company, the worlds biggest commercial forecaster, predicted the UK’s coldest winter for eight years, with December cold spells and extended January and February freezes.  Snow, -C lows and travel chaos are due. Arctic air plumes, a weak Atlantic jet stream and weakening solar output are blamed.

Leon Brown, head of meteorological operations at The Weather Company’s Weather Channel arm, said: “The UK is looking at the coldest winter for eight years, since -. “After cold snaps in a mixed start to winter, we forecast the coldest periods with Arctic influence and snow in January and February.  “Low temperatures should exceed -C. Travel disruption is expected. “A strong Atlantic jet stream gives the UK a mild westerly flow with colder air trapped in the Arctic – but a weaker jet stream is forecast this winter, allowing Arctic air to drain south to the UK. “This causes much colder and longer-lasting cold periods than during a normal winter. “A colder winter is also expected due to the sun’s activity cycle approaching a ‘solar minimum,’ meaning there is less heat and energy reaching Earths atmosphere, contributing to weaker jet stream winds.”  The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The chance of winter - being cold or very cold has increased.” A Met Office forecast said: “Temperatures end October cold or rather cold, then recover. From November  to , temperatures will be generally below normal, with a greater likelihood of frost and snow for higher ground, especially in the North, with any mild spells short-lived.” "},{"url":null,"title":"up 300000 brave former servicemen","story":"NewsUp to , brave former Servicemen robbed of pensions by cruel legal loopholeEXCLUSIVE: The veterans don’t get a penny because those who left the Forces before the pension was introduced in  are not eligiblethey served less than  yearsShareCommentsByPatrick HillPhil Cardy:,  OCT NewsPaul Coddington, Barry Cuckow and Chris Cooper are part of a group of armed forces vets petitioning the Government to change the rules on who is eligible for a military pension \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailUp to , brave former shyServicemen robbed of pensions by a cruel legal loophole are demanding a change in the law.

Be it a hospital car park, a shopping centre, or in this case an airport,you want to leave your car somewhere for a while, youre going to have to pay a price.But one woman had a real shock when she went to leave Bristol Airports drop-off car park recently and prepared to pay the pound fee to lt the barrier, reports Bristol Live. The monitor on the pay machine didnt want her to pay just pound, instead it demanded Susanne Willdig hand over a whopping pound. Ms Willdig says she was in the airport car park for less than five minutes - that equates to a parking rate of pound, an hour. And there was another catch - the pound had to be paid in coins because the machine didnt accept cards. Like most people who might find themselves in a situation like this, Susanne Willdig did not have  pound coins in her car or  pound coins for that matter.  In a bit of a dilemma, a queue of cars quickly began to form behind her at the exit. After getting no response from the assistance button, and with a two-year-old in the back seat of her car, she decided to seek help from a police officer in the car park. He radioed around, talked to their central office and eventually they let me out, she said. He reckoned the machine simply didnt like my number plate, which is a standard plate so Im not sure why - thats never happened before.

On the th anniversary of suffrage in the country, self-confessed feminist Meghan, honoured her hosts with a traditional Maori greeting of “tēnā koutou katoa” , meaning hello to you all. The Duchess told of her pride of being in the country that has such an important place in the history of women’s rights. She said: “The achievements of the women of New Zealand who campaigned for their right to vote, and were the first in the world to achieve it are universally admired.  “In looking forward to this very special occasion, I reflected on the importance of this achievement, but also the larger impact of what this symbolises. “Because yes - women’s suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness. “Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents.  “The basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community. The involvement and voice that allows you to be a part of the very world you are a part of.” “And women’s suffrage is not simply about the right to vote for women but also about what that represents.  “The basic and fundamental human right of all people - including members of society who have been marginalised - whether for reasons of race, gender, ethnicity or orientation - to be able to participate in the choices for their future and their community. “So bravo New Zealand for championing this right  years ago - for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and acknowledged vote, and for all of the people that this effort has paved the way for globally.  “We all deeply thank you.” She ended her speech with a phrase from Kate Sheppard, who was the most prominent member of the women’s suffrage movement in New Zealand. The country’s most famous suffragette was born in Liverpool, and emigrated to New Zealand with her family in . Meghan, who looked stunning in a black Gabriela Hearstgown and a Maori inspired necklace, said: “In the words of your suffragette Kate Sheppard, “All that separates, whether race, class, creed, or sex, is inhuman, and must be overcome.”  The Duke and Duchess were invited to the residence by New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, who asked them to attend thewith around  women chosen from local communities who are continuing to fight for women’s rights. The evening got off to a  start after the building had to be evacuated just moments before Meghan and Harry were due to be officially welcomed. As they were both getting ready in an upstairs room at the sprawling mansion built in , an unidentied person set off a smoke alarm in a downstairs toilet. An official later said it was believed to have been “steam or some form of atomiser”, perhaps an aerosol can, that had caused the  alarm. After a  minute delay, the Duke and Duchess were greeted first by the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges and his we Natalie, before spending around  minutes warmly chatting to Ms Ardern, New Zealand’s third female Prime Minister.  They were welcomed my Dame Patsy Reddy, also the third woman to take up her post. Dame Reddy paid tribute to Kate Sheppard and heralded her contribution to the country’s and indeed the world’s suffrage history. She said: “Kate Sheppard is our Emmeline Pankhurst.  “Under her leadership, New Zealand women were the first in the world to achieve the right to vote –  years before the United Kingdom and  years before the United States. “Kate Sheppard and her fellow suffragists went door-to- door and town-to-town to get signatures for their monster suffrage petition. “They showed the power of women’s words to raise awareness and bring about change. “Kate was a superb communicator. “She used invincible logic in her appeals for justice, fairness and decency.  “She was an effective networker – galvanising other women into action, here and internationally.” The royals were treated to several traditional performances, including a six minute rendition from the poet laurette Dr Selina Tusitala Marsh. The Auckland-based Pacic poet and scholar receited her poem “Lead” about the concept of leadership and what it takes to achieve wellbeing in le. The celebrated high school trio Le Art also performed their song Choose Love. The schoolgirls shot to fame earlier this year when they posted an acapella version of the national anthem that received more than one million views on YouTube.

It’s been enjoyable at the same time, though, and we’re all buying into his ideas.”Off the field there seems to be an air of optimism around Tannadice but Booth knows getting results on the pitch is the only way to realise their hopes of promotion.And that means keeping their unbeaten run under the new boss going against a Dunfermline side that have already bagged a deserved win over the Tangerines.Booth added: “Four points from the first two games isn’t too bad but I think they were two good performances as well.“We feel hard done by we didn’t get the win over Inverness – I think most people there would agree with that but it wasn’t to be.“At least we put in a really positive performance and everyone is pulling in the same direction.“There is a good feel about the place and, hopefully, we can kick on now and go on a little run.“The players, coaching staff, fans all seem to be pulling in the same direction especially since the new gaffer has come in.“A thousand fans down at Partick, great backing and then same again last weekend.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

So many of our players have had really big matches for their clubs in the lead up to the international but they are done now and our total focus is on Ireland this Saturday.#The spine of the squad is from Newtonmore and that should not be any surprise given they have just won the treble.#There are a few Argyll representatives aside from the team captain. Irvine#s Kyles team-mate Roddy MacDonald has also been selected and there are places for Oban Camanachd duo Lorne Dickie and Andrew MacCuish.The Scottish mantra in recent games has been to keep the ball on the ground and to use the wide open spaces to stretch the Irish defence and not allow the hurlers to build up a head of steam with their aerial game.Caberfeidh’s dead-ball expert Kevin Bartlett will again be key and he scored twelve of Scotland’s eighteen points a year ago.There are no rule changes as such this year but there will be an Irish referee, John Keane, which brings its own dimension.Garry Reid added: #The interpretation of the rules will be key. In general, Irish referees tend to let more go and there may be more of a tendency to get away with hands on the back and perhaps more pulling and shoving.#We’ll just need to be careful and concentrate on our game. However there’s no doubt this will make for a fast pace as it will let the game flow and that’s important for the international to remain a spectacle for the supporters.#Scotland squad:Stuart MacDonald Glen MacKintosh The match, which starts at pm, will not be broadcast live this year but the match will be shown in full on BBC ALBA from pm on Saturday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"aray take honours in sporting start to dunoon mod","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere is more to the Mòd than music and drams, and this year#s Royal National Mòd in Dunoon was launched with a festival of sport.Scotland’s biggest Gaelic cultural festival traditionally features shinty, and this year it was Inveraray and Col Glen adult teams contesting the Mòd Cup on Saturday October .A close and hard-fought contest  at Dunoon Stadium in wet conditions resulted in victory for Inveraray, who overcame the Glen  #  after a strong second half performance.Up at the Dunoon Grammar School all-weather pitches there was also a nine-aside women’s shinty match between Oban Lorn and Cowal Ladies, with the Oban team coming out on top -.The Mòd played host to the first ever Primary Schools’ Mòd Shinty Tournament, introduced to celebrate Scotland’s Year of Young People, in which Inveraray again came out on top, beating Kyles and Strachur by a goal to nil.In the Mòd Football Cup, Glasgow Islands came through with a  - win over local team Dunoon Amateurs, which even involved the Glasgow goalkeeper getting on the scoresheet.Chief Executive of An Comunn Gàidhealach, John Morrison, said: #We’ve had a great first weekend at the  Royal National Mòd in Dunoon.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

Donald Trump had already touched down at Prestwick in Air Force One and his cavalcade was heading to Maybole, en route to a weekend of golf and talks at Turnberry. And the convoy of the most powerful president on earth wasn’t going to be impeded by a naughty parker. The astonishing tale unfolded at Ayr Justice of the Peace Court last week. Goudie’s lawyer Peter Lockhart just managed to keep his client on the road, and he left with eight penalty points on his driving licence and a pound fine. Goudie, of The Loaning, Maybole, admitted stopping on a zig-zag line at a pelican crossing, having no insurance, taking his we’s car without permission and not having a full licence.  Depute fiscal Ed Sheeran told the Justice on the bench that at around pm on Friday, July  there was a major police operation on-going on the A. He said that it was part of a management plan due to the visit of the president of the United States of America. The court was told that there was a large police presence in Maybole High Street and that they had noticed the grey Golf was stopped on the zig-zags. They found Goudie inside the shop and the offences unfolded.  Mr Lockhart told the court Goudie’s we was out and he had decided to pop down to the Co-op to get some milk. The solictior added: “My client had not noticed the high police presence. “He was alarmed when he was approached by the police in the shop and even more alarmed when he came out and saw more police, including armed police in the vicinity.” Mr Lockhart explained that it had been a costly exercise as the police had removed and impounded his car. He added: “His we was furious when she found out as it cost pound to get the car back the following day. “He was in the dog house for his stupidity.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEd SheeranVolkswagenJusticePrestwickDonald TrumpAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayrshire vets reveal cases sedated","story":"NewsAyrshire vets reveal cases of \"sedated\" and \"drowsy\" dogs on our beachesWidespread reports of dogs falling ill have sparked panic among pet owners in the region.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsAyr beach \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVets have been inundated with sick dogs on Ayrshires coastline, the Post can reveal.

first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating

capital of Canada.\"We journey through the next  plus years to  and the newly created mosaic on Riverside and the Market Place regeneration with the Society emblem set in stone alongside the other casting associations.\"Included in Tales of the Exiles is a photo gallery of all Colonial Standard Bearers and Lady Bussers dating back to John Johnstone and his Lady Busser Miss C Williamson in .Apart from the First and Second world war years, a Souter has ed to Selkirk every June to cast the Colonial Flag during the Common Riding celebrations.In recent decades it has only taken a flight or two to reach home soil, but in the early days of the Society making their way back to the Royal Burgh from the likes of Hawaii, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand and Brazil often proved more problematic.Ian added: \"Many tales of our members are spread across the book, starting with those who were involved in the founding of the Society in  and ending with stories from our exiles in more recent years.\"Some of these tales were written by High School students as part of the annual Colonial History Medal competition, while others originated from newspaper articles, or from the members themselves.\"Tales of the Exiles is now available from The Forest Bookshop in Selkirks Market Place, priced at pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"highland-duo-bring-album-to-string-jam","story":"FOLK duo

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"young footballers learn lifesaving first aid","story":"CDJFA groups have been learning basic first aid skills, from paramedic Lorne McArthur, which could help treat sports injuries.The youngster#s training included cleaning and bandaging up wounds, supporting broken bones, dealing with concussion and some CPR and  children in total took advantage of this opportunity.Imogen Todd practices resuscitation watched by other young players.

first-hand account by a -year-old former ring-net skipper captured the attention of some of Campbeltown#s youngest anglers.Mario Ondo, Laura Ondova, both , and Marek Ondo, , bumped into Campbeltown#s Dennis Meenan when the Casting the Net project bus sailed into town.Mario and Marek enjoy fishing for mackerel from Campbeltown#s old pier with Marek even smoking their catches himself.Dennis, who stars in a video filmed for the project, popped into the bus, which was in Campbeltown last week, at the same time as the youngsters and told them tales about the ring-net fishing industry, which largely died out in the early s.Dennis, who fished all his le from the age of , explained that two fishing boats would be used to cast a net around a shoal of herring before pulling together to create #a purse# which traps the fish.He said the real skill was not in catching the fish, but in finding them in the first place, at a time when there was no sonar.Nature was the most common guide with gannets, which feed on herring, and basking sharks, which eat the same plankton as the fish, giving away their location.Dennis explained that a single gannet once helped him land a massive catch which filled four boats, off the Tiree coast.Casting the Net, a collaborative project between the Clyde Fishermen#s Association and the Scottish Fisheries Museum, is an oral history project capturing the memories and experiences of the last remaining Clyde ring-net fishermen.The bus, bought on eBay, has been transformed into the project#s mobile hub.Jill de Fresnes, from the Clyde Fishermen#s Association, talked to countless fishermen, including Dennis, carrying out video interviews and collecting clips, photographs and other artacts on display on the bus.Artist Deirdre Nelson transformed the interior with the help of P- pupils from Tarbert Academy, the village where ring-net fishing is said to have been born.Ms Nelson worked with the children to create cushions, a blind and upholstery with exquisite detail based on the interviews.The Scottish Fisheries Museum loaned several historic items to the project, including a needle used to repair nets.As he demonstrated the skill he said he would #never forget#, Dennis said: #Many a long winter#s night you#d spend standing on the quay mending nets.#The bus continued to Ayrshire and Stirling and will be at Tarbert Village Hall tomorrow, Saturday October , where Herring Tales takes place.Carradale#s Lachie Paterson has spent years collecting and collating images of ring-net fishermen which will be displayed at the event alongside the

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

The use of recycling boxes rather than bins and the introduction of food waste caddies has helped the county produce high-quality waste with fewer contaminants, meaning less has to be sent for treatment.Now Mr Reid wants to bring a similar approach to travel in the county as East Lothian prepares for an influx of new residents due to a plethora of new housing developments.And he revealed talks were under way to try and replace the councilrsquos refuse collection vehicles with electric versions as it looks to lead by example.He said: ldquoThe public bought into recycling because we gave them options such as the food waste bins and also because they knew it was the right thing to do.ldquoActive travel will be an evolution but we need to give people access to it.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

No business has been prosecuted for failure to comply with transparency laws.The UK Government is expected to unveil reforms before Christmas.Long Read: The Scottish shop at the Centre of the World Main Street, DouglasOn the long, narrow drag of a Scottish mining village, opposite The Countryside Inn and just a step or two from The Mane Attraction hairdressers, there is a little shop, a former draperrsquos.Number  Main Street looks like a house a child would draw: a square sandstone terrace with a wooden front door flanked by hanging baskets and two rectangular windows, each with a wooden owl perched on its sill.This is real Douglas, South Lanarkshire. But there is also a fake Douglas, a counterfeit  Main Street, one that only exists online: the HQ, among other things, of a global corporation with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Copenhagen and beyond.This particular make-believe version of the draperrsquos shop has a two-storey glass and steel atrium, huge open-planned rooms and an army of hipster staff in designer glasses.It is, at least according to its own website, the Londonoffice of Falcon Business Services, an international ldquocreative advertising agency working for blue-chip clients like Starbucks, HM, Boeing, Cisco and even disgraced mogul Harvey Weinsteinrsquos now bankrupt movie-making concern.Falconrsquos internet offering may look slick ndashauthentic, it would be by far the biggest and most successful business in Scotlandrsquos under-pressure advertising sector ndash but the sitersquos gobbledygook English gives its fakery away.ldquoWe appreciate every culture, we are consist from many dferent culture from many country around the worlds, the agency boasts on its site about its ldquoLondon HQ in Douglas. ldquoThis place very big and cozy, this is our main office consist of large amount of employee across the world.How Falcon portrays its HQ, screen grab of its websiteBack at the real  Main Street, Lilli Clark bursts out laughing when she hears how Falcon describes her surroundings. Clark, with friend Sally Kerr, runs a small book-keeping practice at the old shop, including a ldquovirtual office where a Falcon Business Services is, indeed, registered.The pair find themselves on the edge of the surreal world of Scotlandrsquos notorious ldquotax haven firms: of ghost companies of here-today, gone-tomorrow anonymously owned corporate entities. That is because their address is the registered HQ of thousands of businesses, many created as global criminals exploit Britainrsquos lax and barely policed corporate transparency laws.Most are Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs, a kind of shell firm which anti-corruption campaign Transparency International describes as ldquoa vehicle of choice for money-laundering.Falcon is an SLP. There is no way of knowing who owns the business, how much money it turns over or evenit has anything to do with the website in its name.This, for Clark, is not funny. Because it means her address does not just feature on shlocky websites: it also stars in some of the worldrsquos biggest crime stories.Two years ago The Herald revealed ldquonumber  was the official home of firms at the centre of a major Ukrainian investigation in to allegedly corrupt side-payments on an arms export to the Middle East. Since then Douglas shell firms have rarely been out of the news.Clark stresses she knows nothing about any of the firms using her address. ldquoWe have no control over them whatsoever, she explains. ldquoWe want to get rid of them but we canrsquot.She sighs as she hears the latest on Douglas SLPs. That is because they number among a series of UK shell firms ndash with no identiable real world connection to Britain ndash which The Herald on Sunday has identied as being behind supposedly multi-million-dollar investments in the tyrannical Central Asian state of Uzbekistan.Just one SLP, called Quality Trade Supplies or QTS, is building a steel mill in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, for just over  million euros. This ldquoBritish investment was announced by Uzbekistanrsquos president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, with an official visit to its -hectare site, which, unlike Falconrsquos global HQ, is very real.Presidential press releaseTwo decades after the closure of Ravenscraig, a Scottish company is again investing in steel, albeit overseas. Or is it The Herald on Sunday has made multiple attempts to contact QTS, whose website says it has a representative office in Kazakhstan, as well as its official home at  Main Street, Douglas. We wanted to ask QTS who its owner was. The firm has failed to comply with new UK rules under which last year it should have named any ultimate beneficiary or PSC ndash a ldquoperson of signicant control.The firmrsquos website says the Tashkent Metallurgical Plant is a ldquostate project ndash while the state itself says it is a QTS project. The stated investment is one of the biggest carried out by a Scottish enterprise overseas in recent years.QTS on its site also said it was also building a km railway line with  stops across Kazakhstan, part of a major drive to improve transport links between China and Europe. That job, it said, would involve  construction workers. Again, this would be a nearly unprecedented venture for a Scottish firm.Uzbeks also have questions about who owns QTS. One prominent former Soviet oligarch has been named locally as being behind the firm. A London public relations firm acting on his behalf has denied any connection.Mirziyoyev has also given his official blessing ndash and visit ndash to another major ldquoBritish investment from a Douglas firm, a m cement factory in the underdeveloped western Uzbek region of Karakalpakstan.Shavkat MirziyoyevUzbekistanrsquos Ministry of Economy formally lists ldquoforeign investments in infrastructure or industry every year. These include a roll-call of SLPs with either opaque ownership or PSCs filed in the name of untraceable Uzbeks. At least five other Douglas SLPs are named in press reports or official bulletins as recent investors. None have transparent ownership or any real-world links to Lanarkshire.Uzbek authorities have also named a series of English and Welsh shell firms, mostly limited liability partnerships or LLPs, as ldquoforeign investors.Take Fortalia Consult, a now struck-off LLP. It put up m for a .m factory making washing machines, fridges and cookers. The plant, partly funded by the state National Bank of Uzbekistan, employed hundreds. LLPs have to provide more information on Britainrsquos corporate registry, including accounts. Fortalia, in its last year of existence, , made an operating profit of pound on a turnover of just over pound,. A company investing millions in a white appliances factory made a profit of under a tenner. It did, however, file a PSC. She was Uzbek.Official bulletins, government press releases and state-controlled media reports suggest SLPs and LLPs whose owners are either Uzbeks or unknown have made declared ldquoforeign direct investments of well over poundm in recent years.Other investments officially made by SLPs and LLPs are in real-world factories making everything from spinning equipment to probiotic dairy produce.One of the businesses investing in a major new business district, Tashkent City, is an Edinburgh SLP called Corso Solutions. Corso was created last year but has failed to comply with new rules under which it was supposed to say who its owner is. Fines for failure to comply are pound a day. None has ever been levied.TashkentHuman rights campaigners ndash Uzbek and international ndash have grave concerns about this. They want to know who is buying up chunks of the countryrsquos economy. They are especially concerned about equity and other investments in cotton, the nationrsquos biggest industry.Uzbekistan is currently reforming its cotton farms, which have a record of forced labour ndash slavery, effectively ndash and environmental abuses which have led to the near-disappearance of one of the worldrsquos biggest lakes, the Aral Sea. But reforms are only just beginning. They include partial privatisations that have seen SLPs and English shell firms buy stakes in both processing and picking enterprises.CottonTwo, Trontex of Stirling and Gratum Trading of Edinburgh, received import tax breaks under a Mirziyoyev decree. Both firms, like QTS, have filed at Companies House saying they have not yet attempted to identy a PSC.The Herald on Sunday has written to both Mirziyoyevrsquos press office in Tashkent and the Uzbek Embassy in London. We askedthe president knew who the beneficiaries of his tax breaks were. There was no reply. We also wrote askinghe was concerned that major ldquoforeign investors were failing to reveal who they were. Again, there was no reply.This worries Umida Niyazova. She is a journalist and campaigner who was jailed under Mirziyoyevrsquos predecessor, the authoritarian Islam Karimov. Now based in Berlin, she leads the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights .She says: ldquoThe cotton sector in Uzbekistan is entirely under the control of the state which sets the price of cotton and is the sole beneficiary of revenue from sales on the international market.\"Umida NiyazovaShe adds: ldquoUGF has been monitoring and reporting on state-organised forced labour in Uzbekistanrsquos cotton sector for over eight years. We can confirm that, despite some changes, mass mobilization of forced labour and extortion from organisations and employees to pay for cotton pickers is again ongoing during this yearrsquos cotton harvest, despite Mirziyoyevrsquos public commitments to eradicate it.ldquoFor decades, the production of cotton has been underpinned by a system ... in which Uzbekistanrsquos citizens are forcibly mobilised to pick cotton. This is a state-operated system of forced labour, in which the Uzbek government imposes regional cotton production quotas which are, in turn, allocated by regional officials to their sub-districts.ldquoRegional and district officials are responsible for meeting these quotas under threat of penalty.ldquoWe have observed a proleration of Uzbek entities registered as limited partnerships in Scotland and England, including a number of companies with direct ties to the cotton industry.ldquoWe are interested to know why these companies, in receipt of large swathes of foreign direct investment, want to register in Scotland. Why do these companies not disclose their ownership  Given that hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign direct investment are flowing into the country at this time, the UK government must ensure these companies are not a vehicle for money laundering.ldquoUzbekistanrsquos cotton sector has already disrupted the lives of millions. It would be criminalthey were to be robbed of revenue which should ultimately benefit the Uzbek people.Abandoned ships on the dried-out Aral SeaUzbek sources stress they have no evidence SLPs or LLPs investing in cotton or other industries are responsible for human rights abuses. Nor do they have evidence any nominally UK registered firms are fronts for government officials or others who wish to conceal their identities. They just want to know who is behind investment. They have reason to be concerned. SLPs have been widely abused where in the former Soviet Union, including as part of multi-billion-dollar schemes to launder money out of Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.At last count, some  Uzbeks were named as the PSCs of SLPs. But multiple investigations reveal closer links. A nephew of former leader Islam Karimov in  was named as the effective controller of SLPs involved in a dispute over the ownership of hotels in Riga which culminated in an attempted gangland-style hit.Last year an international journalistic investigation alleged that Karimovrsquos youngest daughter, Lola, and her husband used three SLPs ndash two of which, Five Star Star Technology Support and Greenhall Management, are based in Douglas ndash as part of complex offshore scheme. None of the SLPs has named a PSC.Lola Karimova, from Getty ImagesMs Karimova is a multi-millionaire who last year launched her own fragrance at a party at the Cannes Film Festival attended by Juliette Binoche, Catherine Deneuve, Kristin Scott Thomas and Pamela Anderson.She denies detailed allegations of tax avoidance set out by journalists at a group called The Black Sea.This month Britainrsquos Serious Fraud Office announced it had begun a proceeds of crime investigation against Ms Karimovarsquos estranged elder sister, Gulnara, once touted as a replacement for her father.She is in prison near Tashkent on embezzlement charges, which she denies. British authorities are understood to be seeking to confiscate London properties linked to her and an associate. Swiss authorities have already seized some m in assets.Gulnara Karimova, from Getty ImagesMeanwhile, as The Herald revealed this year, The United Nations Development Programme has blacklisted five SLPs amid concerns over international aid fraud in Uzbekistan. The sanctions are against SLPs called Special Alliance Partnership, Investment Affairs, Trident Asia and Five Star Commercial Services.They are all registered either at  Main Street, or a flat in Edinburghrsquos Montgomery Street, number .The owners of this property, like Clark and Kerr, once ran a virtual office business. They too stress they have no control over the entities registered at what is their home. They also have tried and failed to get SLPs de-registered.Some SLPs have been transferred from Montgomery Street to Douglas. They include Tashkent steel mill builder QTS, whose website still has a map showing its Edinburgh HQ.Montgomery Street, EdinburghThe Montgomery Street flat has been the base for SLPs which played a key role in the -billion Russian Laundromat, one of the biggest and most elaborate money-laundering schemes ever uncovered.:A Baltic bank, a Belarussian bribe and a British embarrassmentNow government investigators in Argentina allege two SLPs using the address were used as part of one of the worldrsquos biggest bribery scandals.Earlier this year The Herald revealed the role played by Scottish shell firms in complex offshore structures used by a construction giant called Odebrecht to pay kickbacks to officials and politicians across Latin America and beyond. The so-called ldquomega scandal ndash nearly bn was paid out, Odebrecht admits ndash has rocked the western hemisphere and led to prosecutions against senior officials in multiple jurisdictions.A former president of Peru, who denies using an SLP based at a Glasgow law firm to take money infor a highway contract, is among those facing prosecution. A senior state oil official close to the outgoing president of Mexico also dismisses reports he took money from the construction firm through SLPs.In Argentina, government anti-corruption investigators have focused on a prominent entrepreneur called Jorge Rodriacuteguez, though he usually goes by the nickname ldquoCorcho, or ldquoCork.In a ldquobox office celebrity court case, Rodriacuteguez is accused of taking in bribes from Odebrecht, which was among companies bidding to build a metro line. He denies any wrongdoing.Corcho Rodriacuteguez, from YouTubeAn Argentinian government report suggests money was transferred the tax haven bank accounts of two SLPs to Uruguay. From there, investigators allege, Rodriacuteguez used his fleet of private plans to fly money in cash across the River Plate to a small airfield near Buenos Aires. Figures of up to m have been cited.The two SLPs named in official papers are Latin Financial and Capital Investment Enterprises, both of which were created and dissolved without ever filing any meaningful paperwork. Rodriacuteguez says he has no connection with the two Scottish firms. His Uruguayan accountants, in testimony, say they were his.The case continues. Rodriacuteguez ndash often described as a lobbyist ndash was part of a politically-linked Buenos Aires jetset often seen in the Uruguayan resort of Punto del Este.His we, Veroacutenica Lozano, hosts a chat show on Argentinian TV. His ex, former s film star Susana Gimeacutenez, has an even bigger rival programme and her own monthly glossy magazine, on whose cover she always features.Susana GimeacutenezAn Odebrecht official in Brazil, Marcio Faria do Bentos, earlier this year said there had been a smooth flow of illicit payments to Argentina until former president Neacutestor Kirchner died in  while his we, Cristina, ran Argentina. The system, Faria said, started ldquoticking smoothly again after he was contacted by Rodriacuteguez.Anti-corruption campaigners are more than aware of the absurdity of linking the fleshpots of Punta del Este or Cannes with Montgomery Street flat, with a derelict phone box in its front garden, or a Lanarkshire draperrsquos shop.The Buenos Aires metroBut Scotland ndash and the UK ndash is part of a world-wide machine for washing dirty money. Our SLPs and our LLPs are like the Swiss banks of old, the means to hide illicit wealth with a veil of British respectability.Graham Barrow, UK-based money-laundering expert, has been slowly but surely unpicking and exposing the system in a series of detailed essays. The Uzbek and Argentinian cases, he says, ldquohighlight yet again that this is a global problemwhich can only be solved by a global effort.But he adds: ldquoThe UK can make a huge contribution by better regulating these entities so that they donrsquot keep cropping up in far flung corners of the world for all the wrong reasons. The British Government is mulling reforms.Punta del Este, UruguayMeanwhile, back in the through-the-looking class world of fake Douglas, ldquoScottland, Falcon Business Services is hiring creatives.

The Herald on Sunday tried to contact Falcon. All its contact details were bogus, its telephone was , its fax . Britain has still to get the number of its fake firms.So what are SLPs SCOTTISH Limited Partnerships, to give them their proper name, were once just a means for farmers to share fields.Then some lawyers figured out such structures made tax-efficient vehicles for managing equity funds. And others realised they were also enticing for people who want to avoid more than just tax.Writer Oliver Bullough has explored the murky world of international offshore finance ndash and its effect on some of the planetrsquos poorest nations ndash for his book Moneyland. He has long watched SLPs being abused.ldquoSLPs and shell structures like them are absolutely crucial to anyone who has wealth to hide, he explains. ldquoWithout them, it would be impossible for crooks and thieves ndash whether theyrsquore rulers of former Soviet states, or leaders of drugs cartels ndash to move their wealth out of the shadows and into the legitimate economy.\"Bulloughs bookHe adds: ldquoSLPs are useful to crooks because, unlike limited partnerships where in the UK, they have legal personality and thus can own bank accounts and other assets, enter into contracts, and take on debt. If the SLPrsquos partners are offshore companies, then their ownership is completely opaque.ldquoThe great advantage of Britain as a place to register a company is that the company looks legitimate, because itrsquos British, but really is not. Our money-laundering regime is so lax, and Companies House doesnrsquot check the accuracy of any information supplied to it. This is why British structures are almost iniably found in the biggest financial scandals.The abuse of SLPs, Bullough stresses, is not a victimless crime. ldquoMore than a trillion dollars a year is stolen from the worldrsquos poorest countries, devastating their economies and spreading misery and destitution, he says. ldquoThat would not be possible without shell structures like SLPs, and itrsquos imperative the UK Government acts to reform them to they can no longer be misused in this way.A map of just some of the SLP scandals in recent yearsA spokesman for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: \"The UK is leading the global fight against money laundering. \"Changes to the law last year have increased the transparency of these financial arrangements, reducing the likelihood of them being used for illegal purposes.ldquoWe carefully developed our recent reforms to further prevent these crimes without harming the legitimate businesses and pensions that invest through limited partnerships.Registrations of SLPs have fallen in the last year after new PSC reguilations were introduced and, crucially, banks in Latvia started refusing to handle their accounts.Comment: Alison Thewliss on why SLP reform cannot waitMore than three months have passed since the UK Government closed its consultation on the reform of limited partnerships, and despite calls for recommendations to be published, nothing has been forthcoming.Today we see yet more evidence linking limited partnerships to opprobrious behaviour abroad this time with regards cotton production in Uzbekistan.Agencies such as Amnesty International, and the Uzbek-German Forum for Human Rights, have gone to great s to expose the coercive and manipulative nature of this industry.Alison ThewlissThe purported involvement of financial vehicles registered in the UK ndash with little or no information offered on ultimate ownership ndash should be of serious concern to UK Government Ministers.Unfortunately, thatrsquos not likely to be the case as far as the UK Government is concerned. A volley of evidence has been sent their way, but met only with indference.The UK Government must take a firm stance on limited partnerships being used to fund corrupt activities and perpetuate human-rights abuses, and stop ignoring the scandal that is continuing to take place on their doorstep.Alison Thewliss is the SNP MP for Glasgow Central"},{"url":null,"title":"lord-adonis-scottish-labour-should-lead-the-way-in-calling-for-a-brexit-vote","story":"Now, though, we are in the fight of our lives to stop this Brexit mess.

They also called on the Scottish government to tackle the problem with action, not words.The \"paid by the minute\" scandal centres on the care industry where councils outsource care at home to private or charitable companies. Care staff are electronically monitored ndash clocking in and out of a clientrsquos home ndash using technology such as mobile phones or iPads.As an example,a carer has five jobs in an hour each lasting six minutes then they will be paid by the minute for a total of  minutes. If the worker is on the Scottish living wage ndash pound. an hour ndash this would see them earn approximately pound. for an hourrsquos work, or just under  pence per minute. Many are not paid for the time in between jobs, or for travel to and from jobs.Scottish Care, which represents private care providers, estimates that the practice of \"paying by the minute\" occurs in half of Scotlandrsquos  council areas. An estimated  per cent ndash or  people ndash of the private care workforce, which stands at ,, are on zero-hours contracts, where most of the \"paid by the minute\" work is found. However, the numbers on ZHCs rises to - per cent in the sector of \"older peoplersquos care\".Care providers and carers are also penalisedworkers stay over the allotted time per visit, in the event of a client being ill or distressed.Scottish Care said: ldquoOver the last few years Scottish Care has continually argued for improvements to conditions which make employment in the care sector precarious for too many iniduals. One of these is the call to offer properly funded contracts to providers to enable them to reduce dependency on zero-hour contracts ... While admittedly some staff desire the flexibility that such contracts provide them with, from our research the vast majority of providers wish to move to a situation where adequate funding makes full-time contracts for the care workforce a possibility.ldquoThe main reason for the existence of zero-hours contracts is the discriminatory practice around the way in which care is bought from charitable and private providers by the public authorities. A local authority only pays for the work which is done rather than what may be intended. This makes it impossible to guarantee hours for many, especially smaller care providers.\"Scottish Care believes that we need to radically change the way we commission and buy care services ... At the moment many, especially smaller organisations, are effectively paid by the minute and therefore by extension unless the provider has its own reserves and assets the worker is paid by the minute. This is no way to deliver care in the st century.ldquoWe are faced with a scenario where workers are pressurised to get tasks done in as quick a time as possible and are penalisedthey are late for their next client. For the person receiving the care this makes the whole experience less than dignied despite the best efforts of inidual care workers ... This is especially unacceptable when we are talking about supporting people with palliative and end-of-le care.Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, said: \"There is something very wrong about a local authority treating its own staff fairly and well and yet treating the staff of services they buy in, whether they are employed by a charity or private care provider, in a manner which is little less than exploitative. Workers are made to clock in and clock out and their organisations are only being paid by the minute, and even thena worker is late or stays longer because someone needs more help or is ill they are being penalised.ldquoThese electronic call monitoring systems are treating care staff asthey cannot be trusted. They do not give dignity or value to a critical workforce. If we ever want to create a fair system of work we need a fair system for commissioning care.\"We have a massive challenge to attract people to do the fundamentally important job of care. People are being put off because of unfair conditions imposed by local authorities upon care organisations. How can we expect human-rights-based care in Scotland when we have created a system which denies the basic rights to the care worker and their employer \"Jim McCourt, one of Scotlandrsquos most prominent trade unionists who runs the Inverclyde Advice and Employment Rights Centre in Greenock, brought the issue of care workers being paid by the minute to the attention of The Herald on Sunday.\"Itrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy,\" says McCourt. He blamed the issue on care providers bidding against each other for council contracts and creating ldquoa race to the bottom in the market. ldquoThey bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer,\" he said.\"These private care companies are funded by the public purse as they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system,\" said McCourt, adding: \"This is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society. We are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.\"One of Scotlandrsquos most senior care officials, who wished to speak anonymously, described the practice as \"hypocritical and obscene\".\"To impose penalties because a care worker has stayed longer than was thought necessary with a client who is distressed or unwell is the very antithesis of what the care profession is about. We donrsquot treat nurses like. This is the worst type of precarious employment. The current system needs to end.A spokesperson for Cosla, the Scottish council umbrella organisation, said: ldquoCouncils work closely with the providers in their area to deliver and commission social care services. Inidual employers are responsible for their own practices but Cosla is trying to create an environment in which social care can be seen as an increasingly attractive career.\"This requires social care workers to be rewarded fairly and valued by their employers as well as by the rest of society.A spokesperson for the Care Inspectorate, which regulates care in Scotland, said: ldquoThe Care Inspectorate works closely with care providers to ensure that care in Scotland is as good as it can be. We expect everyone who relies on care at home to experience good-quality care which meets their needs and respects their rights and choices.

Alan worked for the company ndash the biggest parcel provider after the Post Office ndash from .He saw an advert for an ldquoowner driver franchise with the company, billed as self-employment, and thought it would be a perfect fit for him. As self-employed Alan could work when he wanted, have weekends with his family, and be his own boss. Today, Alan describes the job as a ldquomassive lie.What Alan experienced is something campaigners call bogus self-employment ndash a growing phenomenon in the UK where employers bring someone on as self-employed but treat them asthey were a member of staff. That means they get none of the perks of being staff ndash they have to pay their own tax and national insurance, and they donrsquot get sick pay or holiday pay ndash but all of the drawbacks. ldquoWhen the bosses said jump, we had to say lsquohow high rsquo,Alan said.Alan got only two weeks holiday a year, had to work every Monday to Friday, as well as weekends when ordered, and when he worked there drivers were fined poundthey took a day off sick.

He had diabetes and had been charged by DPD after attending a specialist renal appointment. He went on to miss other appointments.

UK Government rules permit a maximum of  hoursrsquo driving in any working day ndash but Alan says he often spent  hours behind the wheel.Like all workers in the gig economy, it was the precarious nature of his employment which left Alan most vulnerable. ldquoWe were afraid to say anything.

She added: ldquoMost are migrant workers with little English and they just take it as they feel it would be too hard to get another job.Emma also told of shts being cancelled at the last minute. In the restaurant where she works the biggest problem is that staff have no contracts at all. There was also delayed payment of wages to staff, short-changing for overtime, and staff being forced into split shtsthe restaurant was quiet ndash this would see a waitress told to take an unpaid break of two or three hours between lunch and dinner. ldquoIt seems like the employment policy is just to treat people like s**t, she said.Bad employment practices can also be reflected in a bad attitude to customers.

That terries the rest of the workforce.It also plunges people into poverty, says McCourt ndash as many agency workers were unemployed before entering the gig economy anddismissed will have to endure the wait for their benefits to be reinstated. Many have been sent by job centres to agencies and told to take the job the agencies offer them or risk being sanctioned.Amazon ndash which has around , UK workers and recognises no trade union ndash announced this month that it was raising wages for its staff employees. The move was hailed as a positive step forward by a company which has been under fire over employment practices for years. The Scottish Government had been criticised for giving Amazon pound.m in taxpayer money.Last month, though, new rules were announced that there would be no state handouts in Scotland for firms which did not pay the living wage. Shortly afterwards, Amazon announced it would raise wages for employees. What went pretty much unnoticed though was that Amazon simultaneously decided to phase out its bonus and stock award programmes for hourly workers.ldquoWhat that all amounts to, says McCourt, ldquois no benefit to the workers. Staff are furious but not surprised.In separate investigations, McCourt has also come across an increasing number of employers using absence management policies which seem designed to sack staff who have been off sick. ldquoThere is a growing occupational health industry which works hand-in-hand with employers to get staff dismissed, he said, citing cases where employers ignored details of sickness provided by GPs and consultants, but instead relied on assessments from private occupational health advisors which results in dismissal. ldquoThis is the world we live in, says McCourt.He has also uncovered a new scandal in the gig economy ndash workers being paid literally by the minute in the private care sector.As the care sector becomes increasingly privatised, companies are being hired by councils to provide care to the sick and elderly in their homes. Many care staff are on zero-hours contracts ndash but thousands are also paid by the minute.ldquoItrsquos the ultimate in the gig economy, says McCourt. ldquoCompanies bid against each other for a contract and it is a race to the bottom. They bid with prices they canrsquot meet and it is their workers who suffer.An example of a care worker paid by the minute would be as follows: a care worker has five jobs in an hour ndash going to the homes of clients to help with their personal needs and medication ndash each job takes six minutes, meaning the carer is viewed as having worked  minutes in an hour.ldquoThese private care companies are funded by the public purse, says McCourt, ldquoas they are contracted by councils ndash so our tax pounds are propping up this system. There is a big dference here to other employment practices as we are not talking about stacking CDs in a warehouse ndash this is about looking after the most vulnerable people in society.ldquoWe are looking at a value set here ndashpeople think there is money to be made in this way out of caring for the sick and elderly then there is something very wrong, especiallythe public purse is being used.Background: Workers are stepping back in time to darker ageA BROWSE through the files of Better Than Zero is like stepping into a time machine and travelling back to the days of the dark satanic mills of the Industrial Revolution.Itrsquos a litany of employees begging their boss for work, staff having to pander to management in order to secure shts, of bullying, harassment, humiliation, low wages, people living hand to mouth, and the steady erosion of pride and dignity. There are examples of female staff who have asked to change shts being texted by their male manager saying: \"My we is out tonight, why donrsquot you come round and then I will change your sht.\"\"The work is sold to the employee as flexible,\" says Sarah Collins of BTZ, \"but there is no flexibility for the worker.\" Staff are expected to take what shts are offered to them, regardless of how few or how many the hours are ndashthey cause a fuss and stand up for themselves itrsquos unlikely they will get any more work. \"All the control is with the employer,\" Collins adds.One of the latest issues within precarious employment is the rise of questionable practices within a small minority of social enterprise firms ndash companies meant to be doing a social good and often in receipt of financial support from the public purse. Some social enterprises are hiring staff on zero hours contracts ldquothen quickly sacking or dismissing themthey raise any concerns. BTZ spoke of firms claiming to be involved in sustainable transport initiatives pressurising and bullying staff on zero hour contracts, or paying cash in hand. There are reports of similar behaviour by social enterprise companies refurbishing kitchen goods or furniture for the poor and elderly to buy at cheap rates.\"On the surface they look great, and there are plenty of social enterprises doing great work but the model has been perverted by a few for bad reasons,\" BTZ said.\"Bogus self-employment\" is another new problem ndash it crossed over from the gig economy where some food delivery drivers were hired on a self-employed basis and is now in many sectors. The organisation cites the case of a beautician in a nail bar who was taken on as self-employed but was told by management when to come in, when to go home, and how much to charge.\"They are not self-employed at all,\" says BTZ. \"It is just a cost saving exercise as the employer is not paying tax, national insurance, sick pay, holiday pay, or pension contributions. There is a big issue here of the exchequer potentially missing out on huge amounts of tax.Self-employment has massively increased since the financial crash of . The largest increase is among women in the following three occupations: cleaners, child minders and hairdressers. Most people drt in and out of self-employment as they look for more stable, less precarious jobs.\"The Scottish Government is projecting Scotland as a wonderful place to visit, but who is checking on the labour conditions of the people in the tourism industry,\" BTZ says.At the core of the problems with zero hours contracts, in particular, is the bullying it seems to enable in the worst managers ndash staff who want to work as many hours as possible are unlikely to defend themselvestreated badly by their boss. Precarious employment also affects young workers in their late teens and early s more than other age groups.\"Bullying is everywhere,\" says BTZ. \"This leads to burn out, mental health problems...unemployment may be at an all time low but the human cost is Dickensian. Couple all this with the housing situation and you see that precarious work leads to precarious lives. If you donrsquot have a steady income and are just bumping from job to job and house to house, every aspect of your le is affected.\"If you are on zero hours you arenrsquot going to get a mortgage, and yoursquoll need a guarantor for private rented accommodation. Thatrsquos why sofa surfacing is on the rise, why people who previously lived independently are moving back home to their parents. It makes people vulnerable not just to loan sharking but even sex for rent. It all knits together. This is what young people have come to expect in Scotland in .Insecure work can also mean in-work poverty as well. Two parents in insecure employment can actually be worse off financially than a family on benefits.Precarious employment has a corrosive effect, with zero hour contracts now even affecting university lecturers it is little wonder, BTZ believes, that young people are leaving school with a jaded view of the world of work and the opportunities on offer to them.\"The most depressing thing is that young people think this is the norm,\" said Sarah Collins. \"They know what is happening is not right, but they donrsquot have any expectation of any other type of work.\"Better Than Zero said: \"It is all well and good saying we want a fair work society, a fair work economy, but on the frontline it is almost laughable how far these claims and aspirations are from the way that huge numbers of people make a living.\"BTZ said that the impact on mental health of precarious employment was a growing problem. Disabled workers are often the most vulnerable to exploitation too. If a disabled worker on a zero hours contract starts asking for wheelchair ramps, or other assistance at work, itrsquos easy for an unscrupulous employer to just take them off the rota, BTZ says.The night-time economy, where a lot of precarious employment is found, is only set to grow in Scotland as bars and clubs push for later licensing laws. Butyou are a young female member of staff on zero hours, with little power to argue for an earlier sht, then going home late at night becomes a hazard of work. Few companies pay for staff to get taxis even in the early hours of the morning.BTZ has accounts in its files of staff finishing work at am and waiting for the first bus in the morning to get home, or staff going to a casino that stays open until dawn and buying one drink to nurse until public transport starts again. There are reports of female staff being harassed and intimidated on late night streets.As the campaign team of BTZ say of all the cases they are investigating, \"is a little dignity, respect, and safety too much to ask \"The Herald on Sunday asked the Scottish Government to put forward the relevant minister for interview on matters related to precarious employment and the gig economy. No interview was forthcoming.Reaction: what the companies sayGRAND CENTRAL HOTELA spokesperson for Grand Central said they did not accept that the comments about the hotel ldquoin any way represent the experience of our valued colleagues.

They have been addressed.A Whitbread spokesman said yesterday that the company is working with Highland Council to ensure \"all the relevant data and supporting information\" is made available.\"We understand the application will go before the planning committee in November,\" he said.The proposed hotel has attracted  representations from the public ndash both in favour and against.Local hoteliers and other accommodation providers claim a Premier Inn would affect trade and result in local job losses, while supporters say it would boost tourism and greatly improve the site which has been described as an eyesore.Earlier this year, Caithness Chamber of Commerce warned that the project would have \"a signicant negative impact\" on other businesses and the town centre.But retired local businessman Andy Bruce, who ran Far North Aviation at Wick airport for  years, supports the proposed development at the former mart site in Ormlie Road.Caithness is \"screaming out\" for more hotel accommodation, he said.Mike Potts, chairman of Thurso Community Council, also backed the plan. \"It will utilise the site properly, provide further amenities and will tidy up an area which desperately needs it,\" he said.\"I know theres opposition from other hoteliers and accommodation providers but Premier offers a very basic service which is cost-effective and would be accessible by rail.\"However, Mr Potts said the hotel plan could \"compound the existing traffic problem\" in that part of Thurso and says planners should address this.Whitbread has applied for a three-storey hotel with landscaping and car parking.If approved, it would be the most northerly Premier Inn in the UK.The development would represent a multimillion-pound investment and create around  jobs.The site was owned by Tesco, which planned to build a new supermarket, but the project was later scrapped.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Sunday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amSee this week#s edition of The Orcadian for over thirty job listings.

The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much. I hope people will involve and immerse themselves in these events as much as they can.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years.

The ersion could then reopen to traffic shortly after a train clears the other side.Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP, Ian Blackford has been campaigning for the revised system with support from Scottish Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson.Mr Blackford said: \"This has the potential to be great news and work now must be put in place to make these plans a reality. I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue.

Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Sunday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This, after all, is the man who took hundreds of millions from BHS, before selling it to a serial bankrupt for a pound and leaving it with a £ million hole in its pension fund. As the company collapsed and , people lost their jobs, the chairman of Arcadia Group – which includes Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Miss Selfridge and Topshop – was splashing his cash on luxury holidays or on his m yacht, Lionheart. This is the man who put his company in the name of his we, Tina, who lives in Monaco, in order to cut his tax bill.In Oliver Shah’s unauthorised biography, Damaged Goods – much of which Green disputes – the -year-old billionaire is presented as an intolerant bully prone to expletive-filled temper tantrums. His lavish parties – at which champagne flows and superstars perform – have seen him compared to Jay Gatsby. But it is impossible to imagine that suave,amoral, bootlegger yelling: “You’re absolutely f*****g useless. I should throw you out of the window, but you’re so fat you’d probably bounce back in again!” as Shah claims Green once yelled at one of his employees.In one interview from , Green was described as “the archetypal Alpha male [who] calls me ‘hon’”. Of the #MeToo campaign, he is alleged to have asked: “Where’s this all going to end  There’s no stag parties, no hen parties, no more girls parading in the ring at the boxing.” Yet, when thethreatened to run a story suggesting Green had used Non Disclosure Agreementsto conceal sexual harassment, bullying and racist abuse – accusations he denies – he spent £,to secure an injunction.Why would he bother when he is already so poorly regarded and when, famously, injunctions tend to attract – rather than deflect – publicity  The answer might lie with Harvey Weinstein. The film producer, whose serial sexual assaults were the catalyst for #MeToo, used NDAs to silence some of his victims. The ’s story was already being billed as the UK’s next big #MeToo scandal. Such a scandal might well have lost Green his remaining friends. And he still has his knighthood to protect. When MPs threatened to strip him of it in the wake of the collapse of BHS, he paid £m back into the pension fund so it clearly means a lot to him.In the end, however, the half a million he threw at stymieing thewas wasted . The Court of Appeal granted an interim injunction pending a trial. But on Thursday afternoon, Labour peer Peter Hain used his parliamentary privilege to identy Green as the man at the centre of the story.Lord Hain’s actions were motivated by a belief that Green was abusing his power and that the allegations ought to be in the public domain. But he appears to have ridden roughshod over a legal process which was still on-going and which would have explored the public interest argument. Eyebrows were further raised when it emerged Hain was an adviser to the legal firm Gordon Dadds which represented the.This is far from the only legal and or ethical conundrum raised by the events of the past few days. The ’s investigation has also renewed the debate on the use of NDAs. And it has intensied the debate over injunctions. Why should the super-wealthy be able to avoid scrutiny  And are injunctions even practical in an age of global communication In the story theran before Green’s identity had been revealed, it claimed NDAs – or gagging clauses – had been weaponised and were being used to cover up wrongdoing. In February, Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Weinstein, broke the terms of an NDA she had signed to tell how –  years previously – the film producer had exposed himself to her and askedhe could watch her bathe.The issue hit the headlines again earlier this month after a woman who claims she was raped by footballer Cristiano Ronaldo said she had been pressured into signing an NDA worth ,. Criminal charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. Lawyers for Ronaldo later admitted the existence of the NDA, but denied the rape allegation. The police in Las Vegas – where the alleged assault took place – have now reopened their investigation.Yesterday, Emma Ritch, executive director of feminist organisation Engender, said there were two types of NDAs: those tucked into contracts in advance of employment and those used in the settlement of a sexual harassment case. “The ones tucked into contracts are pre-emptive NDAs about anything that happens in your workplace and those have a real squelching effect on all sorts of disclosures, including sexual harassment,” she says. “That’s why the Equality and Human Rights Commission [EHRC] recommendations on sexual harassment produced in December said: ‘scrap those – just get rid of them’, which I would agree with.“The ones which come at the end of a negotiated process and settlement are also used to squelch disclosures. They can’t be used to stop someone reporting a crime, but it is questionable the extent to which workers understand that. They may not be able to properly assess whether or not their employer is going to come after them and that does create a chilling effect, particularly in the more serious instances.”Jillian Merchant, employment lawyer with Thompsons, claims almost all settlements in sexual harassment cases involve a confidentiality clause. “They are very widespread,” she says. “The vast majority of the women in these situations sign these agreements because they want to forget all about what happened and they don’t want it all over the media, or because the employer offers them more money than they would get at a tribunal. “Some women want their day in court, but others would rather not. It’s easy for employers who have got the money so they can just say: ‘We will buy this off.’”Merchant believes the answer is to ban NDAs in sexual harassment cases because, as things stand, the scale of the problem is being masked. “The fact employers can settle and keep it quiet gives them more power and stops them having to take any action against the alleged perpetrator. It also allows repeat offending to happen without any consequences.”One negative consequence of outlawing NDAs, however, is that more women would have to fight their employers through tribunals, which would be traumatic for them.Media lawyer David McKie of Levy and McRae believes an outright ban on NDAs in sexual harassment cases would make it more dficult to tailor settlements to a erse range of situations.“Every single case is dferent, often involving twonot more iniduals who each have feelings and sensibilities, who are at dferent stages in their lives, who may think ‘Yes, I would like this to be kept confidential’ and then five years later might feel dferently,” he says.“It is absolutely not that I want to stop people from complaining to the police. But I think creating a hard and fast rule which prevents two people from contracting is a bad idea. It removes versatility and flexibility and I think both those features are important in law and in le.”At the Appeal Court, theargued that it had not signed any NDA and that there was a strong public interest in the information being published.But the judges who granted the interim injunction said the High Court judge had failed to take into account the legitimate role NDAs played in the consensual settlement of disputes. Though there seems to have been an assumption that thestory was being propelled by the complainants, the ruling also pointed out that two of the five women who had signed the NDAs wanted them adhered to.Still, doesn’t thehave a valid point  If a businessman has used NDAs on multiple occasions to settle sexual harassment cases, isn’t it important that potential future employees should be aware of this “I can absolutely see that argument,” says McKie. “It’s a perfectly legitimate argument and no doubt forcefully made by the . There are arguments to be made too about disclosure and the importance of freedom of expression. “But a court has to make dficult decisions balancing competing interests. The judges made reference to the rights of claimants – some of whom may not want the details in the public domain. What could happenthe details surrounding some of the claimants are publicised is that other employees might start saying: ‘Oh, I see that happened in head office: were you one of the women affected, Doris ’ Doris may not have wanted those details to come out, but now she has been effectively identied.“The other thing is,they have signed confidentiality agreements knowingly, with the benefit of legal advice and have accepted the money, part of that money is for agreeing not to speak, which I understand many people feel is morally wrong. However, it is the reality of many settlements in most forms of legal disputes. “They may have thought: ‘Would I rather have £, in my account but live with the fact I have to remain silent ’ We can all be idealistic, but everyone has to live, and the counter-argument is that they could have refused to agree to confidentiality and either renegotiate, or,appropriate, sue. But suing involves publicity and that is why confidentiality is often attractive both to the victim and the offending or paying employer. It may have been an active decision taken with professional advice. Signing that contract has consequences – so on balance I can see precisely why the appeal court reached the conclusion it did.”Injunctions are also regarded by many as an abuse of power and wealth. Green is the latest in a succession of celebrities who have large sums of money to stop allegations of their nefarious behaviour hitting the front pages. Most notorious perhaps is the case of Ryan Giggs. In , Giggs won a superinjunction after learning a tabloid newspaper intended to run a story on his affair with reality TV star Imogen Thomas. But the lawyers forgot the injunction didn’t cover Scotland and so he was named in the Sunday Herald and by , Twitter users. The following day, Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming – who had been campaigning against the use of injunctions – also named him in the House of Commons.As a result of the injunction, Giggs’ infidelity received even more publicity than it would otherwise have done. Soon after, it emerged he had also been having a long-term affair with his brother’s we. Months later, Jeremy Clarkson voluntarily lted a “pointless” injunction on his alleged infidelity after details circulated online. Even where injunctions are still in place, they are not particularly effective. I would wager most readers know the identity of the married actor who had an affair with escort Helen Wood even though I am not allowed to tell you. Ditto the identities of everyone involved in the extra-marital threesome in an olive-oil-filled children’s pool. This is because they were all named in US newspapers and on the internet.Of course, the dference between the injunctions taken out by Giggs, Clarkson et al is that they were attempts to cover up consensual affairs, whereas the allegations against Green involve the harassment of multiple women. Green’s injunction was granted not on the grounds of privacy, but on the grounds of the NDAs.Writing in the , Geoffrey Robertson QC claimed the Court of Appeal decision was inevitable. “Commercial lawyers who later become judges may have an instinctive preference for freedom of contract over freedom of speech, asasked to balance hard cash against hot air,” he said. There is an irony in both Labour and the Conservatives expressing such concern over this case. It was Tony Blair who gave Green his knighthood and David Cameron who asked him to review public sector efficiency. Some cynics might also suspect that the government’s sudden preoccupation with NDAs is a useful deflection away from its own bullying and harassment problem, which has yet to be properly addressed.But NDAs embolden perpetrators and encourage repeat offending and clearly some women do feel pressurised into signing them. Last week on BBC Question Time, SNP MP Hannah Bardell claimed she had once signed one because she feared losing her job.So Women and Equalities Select Committee chair, Maria Miller MP, was justied in calling for a review of their use and legality, following the committee’s report on sexual harassment in the workplace in March. And Theresa May was right to commit to bringing forward the government’s consultation “to seek to improve the regulation around non-disclosure agreements and make it absolutely explicit to employees when a non-disclosure agreement does not apply and when it cannot be enforced”.Whether Hain was right to invoke parliamentary privilege to name Green is a bone of contention. Several legal experts – including Glasgow University law professor James Chalmers – believe it was wrong to do so while the legal proceedings were still ongoing. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio : “We can’t operate a democratic free society when peers or MPs decide to take the law into their own hands.”As for Green, he is now at the centre of a hate-fest. Every negative story ever written about him has resurfaced every anecdote about his sweary brashness has been retold. For the moment he still has his suite at the Dorchester, his yacht, a few loyal friends and his knighthood to console him.

My Scottish Conservatives colleagues are determined to see this continue.”While much of the focus is on whisky’s growth potential as an export, the UK remains the fourth biggest market for Scotch in the world.Between  and , when the automatic alcohol duty escalator raised excise on spirits by  per cent, the volume of whisky released for sale in the UK dropped by nearly a fth, from  million cl bottles to  million.Since , duty has only risen by . per cent and UK volumes have picked up, to  million cl bottles released for sale last year.Industry insiders say ato rising spirit duties would hit investment that supports , rural jobs in Scotland and more than , across the UK.Graeme Littlejohn, deputy director at the SWA, said the spirit duty escalator had been “hugely damaging” to the industry and called on the Chancellor to keep tax levels stable.“It is only over the last five years that we have seen the domestic market stabilize, in large part due to the more positive duty policy we have seen since ,” Littlejohn said. “It would be a mistake for the Chancellor toto raising duty on Scotch. There would undoubtedly be a strong reaction from the industry, which the Prime Minister described only this week as important to the UK.“The Chancellor should continue the freeze on spirits duty he put in place just last year, which actually increased government revenue from spirits by  per cent and supported an industry which provides jobs and investment in communities up and down the country.”Charles Ireland, the general manager for Great Britain, Ireland and France at Diageo, whose Scotch whisky brands include Bell’s and Johnnie Walker as well as single malt distilleries including Oban, Dalwhinnie and Lagavulin, said the freeze was essential to ensuring continued investment in production.“Currently  per cent of the total cost of a bottle of Scotch is tax and British drinkers pay over  per cent of all the alcohol duty collected in the whole of the EU, despite only making up  per cent of the population,” Ireland said. “Tomorrow’s Budget is an opportunity for the Chancellor to address these issues by implementing a freeze, providing producers with certainty and encouraging further investment.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"no shortage of goals in action packed weekend ","story":"There was loads of football action on Saturday with LK Galaxy claiming a convincing win against Tizers to win the Association Cup.Final score was an incredible -, with no fewer than five goals coming from Jordan Thomason.Meanwhile, the contest for the County Shield was won by Ness at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that.

This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Sunday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in

the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster. They had abolished the veto of the House of Lords and Home Rule was due to be implemented in . The Tories seized on the issue of Home Rule as the most effective weapon to bring down the Liberals. Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism. But there were some and among them was the Reverend J.B. Armour of Ballymoney, County Antrim. A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8680982.1540388113!/image/image.jpg","title":"london support sought for 20 000 jobs blueprint","story":"A delegation from an area rocked by the loss of more than , highly paid manufacturing jobs in recent years is currently in Westminster with a blueprint to revitalise its economy.Business leaders, politicians and council officials from Mid and East Antrim are telling the UK Government of their ambitious plans to deliver economic growth through the proposed £bn Belfast Region City Deal.The substantial economic opportunity includes plans for around £m of investment in Mid and East Antrim, which has suffered signicant job losses with the closures of Michelin and JTI Gallaher in Ballymena.This includes proposals to extend The Gobbins clf path, Islandmagee, the regeneration of Carrickfergus and the creation of an innovation and inspiration centre at the St Patrick’s site in Ballymena.Anne Donaghy, council chief executive, said: “As a council, we are fully committed to supporting business growth and development, and promoting an environment that encourages and facilitates investment in our borough.“We focus our efforts on being an enabler to the wealth creators.

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8684387.1540633447!/image/image.jpg","title":"competition win up to 10 tickets for this week s calor ni leisure show","story":"Win tickets to the second annual NI Leisure Show which kicks off this Friday, November  and runs until Sunday, November .

We will have state of the art facilities, this will be a top rate training facility for local clubs and schools. Our kids deserve this. There will be high-tech lighting that will illuminate the pitch but won’t effect the houses near by.“It’s vital that local kids get full use of this facility, we want it filled to capacity every day with schools, we envisage coaches training kids here, Gaelic clubs, soccer clubs, after-schools activities and outdoor gym classes. I believe this will transform the community.”Work is due to begin in December andall goes according to plan it should be completed by the end of March.Cllr Baker said the investment by Belfast City Council is a big boost for the community. “This area suffered badly under Lisburn Council and we are delighted now that this huge investment has come into the area. We have a population of just under , people here and they deserve nothing but first class facilities and that’s what we are delivering.“As a father and a member of the community here I would love nothing better than on a Sunday morning having a blitz here, rather than going to other parts of Belfast.

New graves are only available in Blaris cemetery when someone dies, the days of pre-planning your funeral or purchasing multiple graves are gone, we are almost at crisis point with our cemeteries.”Last year Lisburn and Castlereagh Council was tendered for a new cemetery, however the tender was unsuccessful.Cllr Corr said: “Because of boundary changes people in the Colin area are no longer Lisburn Council meaning they will have to pay more to be buried in Blaris because that cemetery  crematorium is no longer in their jurisdiction.“This is reaching crisis point, we need to have a radical approach, review and rethink around the issue of burials, cremations and cemetery spaces. We can’t wait until the day somebody is refused burial because there is no space.”With that in mind Belfast City Council have come up with the new cemeteries working group to look at these issues and to also come up with ideas around the development of our cemeteries.Cllr Corr said: “I am the party representative on the group and we are coming up with some excellent plans. For example, a new multi-million pound upgrade will be going into Roselawn crematorium.“We still need a new cemetery for North and West Belfast, it’s a very sensitive subject.“Our cemeteries are also in a position where they can become historical and tourist attractions. Look at Tom Hartley’s cemetery tours, they tell the tale of our city, from rich tombs and headstones to poor grounds where thousands of our poor are buried.“Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin is one of the main tourist attractions on the island of Ireland, it went from being a crime hotspot to being a place of beauty and interest, because it tells the tale of the formative years around the formation of the Irish Free State – our cemeteries are no dferent.“There have been books written about the City Cemetery and Milltown Cemetery.”Cllr Corr continued: “Clton Street Graveyard contains the graves of some historically signicant families, including the Dunvilles, the Sinclairs and Henry Joy McCracken, one of the leading United Irishmen. It was closed to public access approximately  years ago due to anti-social behavior. This has now decreased and the local area of Henry Place has been re-generated and a new business hub has been formed. The graveyard remains locked due to concern regarding the safety of some of the monuments. There are currently regular requests for access from tourists and visitors with a genealogical or historical interest in the graveyard.“Our social, political, economic and religious history are in our cemeteries and we need to have them as places we can use for education.“Take for example the City Cemetery heritage project, we want to bring tourists, academics and school children in as well as the local community.Our cemeteries are at their safest when people are in them, Tom Hartley’s tours have proved that.“The purpose of this working group is to give an extra edge and focus while giving the issues of graves, cemeteries and monuments the attention they deserve.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"newington boss crossan demands swift improvement","story":"Steel and Sons Cup quarter-finalSt James’ Swts vNewington Donegal Celtic ParkNEWINGTON manager, Conor Crossan has demanded an improved showing from his side as they continue the defence of their Steel and Sons Cup title with a quarter-final away trip to St James’ Swts on Saturday. The North Belfast side suffered a - home defeat to Lurgan Celtic earlier this month as they lost ground to Championship  league leaders Annagh United. Last Saturday, they bowed out of the Intermediate Cup following a - penalty shoot-out defeat at Maiden City after the game finished - after  minutes. Crossan feels Saturday’s game is the perfect opportunity for his side to rediscover their form in a competition that is close to their hearts. “We are looking forward to Saturday, hopefully we can get back to winning ways,” said Crossan.“The boys know that the performances haven’t been good enough over the last couple of weeks. “We want to stay in as many cup competitions as we can because of the way the league is structured. “It was a poor result and a poor performance against Lurgan Celtic and we had a few players out last Saturday, but it was sore getting beat on penalties.“You always want to be going into the big games on the back of a win and our form of the last two weeks hasn’t been good. “We are going into this match against a team that has won  from  so they’ll be full of confidence. It will be up to me to get the team up for this game.” As defending champions, Newington will be the favourites to progress, especially considering they play in a higher league. Yet, the progress made by St James’ Swts hasn’t gone unnoticed in the north of the city and Crossan is refusing to underestimate the challenge posed by the Swts at Donegal Celtic Park on Saturday. “People might underestimate the Ballymena League, but you have some great teams in that league – the likes of Bangor and Coagh and teams who were in Championship  in recent years,” added the Newington boss. “They are playing at a good level and they have players who have experience of playing in the Irish League. “They’ll be full of confidence and I don’t think they lost too much sleep when they drew us.“They are the type of team who relish the challenge no matter who they face. “They’ve been making noise for a while now.“They will want to build on that start and keep going, but hopefully we can put a stop to that winning run on Saturday.” St James’ Swts assistant manager Dan Murphy, meanwhile, insists the club is “buzzing” ahead of Saturday’s eagerly-anticipated clash with the defending Steel and Sons Cup champions. The West Belfast side have made an incredible start to the   season and have won all  of their game so far. The only stain on an otherwise perfect start came when they lost the points following their - win over last year’s Ballymena and Provincial League winners Glebe after it emerged one of their players should have been serving a suspension arising from a ban with his previous club. St James’ are aiming to go a step further than they managed in last season’s competition when they bowed out after losing - to Linfield Swts in the last eight.  “The whole club is buzzing, we know how big this competition is. We got to this stage last year and we lost out to Linfield Swts,” said Murphy. “We were - down and we gave a penalty away and went - down. “We got a goal back and we threw everything at them to get an equaliser and we make a silly mistakes and they broke and made it -. “It was a bit gut-wrenching. We wanted to go on further in the competition and we are just hoping to go one step further this year and make it into the semi-finals.” Last season, the Swts challenged for promotion from the Ballymena and Provincial League Premier Division, but fell short at the end of a busy campaign. This season, they are, strictly speaking, unbeaten on the pitch and Murphy feels that is in no small part because of the summer signings made by manager Damien McStravick. “Last year, we knew we had a good team and we were playing good football,” said Murphy. “Towards the end of the season, it was just injuries and suspensions that killed us.“Our squad was a bit light and a few boys had to play with knocks. “During the summer, we made some brilliant signings thanks to Damien McStravick. He met boys who had played at a higher level and sold them on the ethos of the club. “We ended up with a smashing squad. “We kept all the players we had last year and we’ve added a bit more quality to it. “The new boys have all bought into what the club is about and they are enjoying their football.” This Saturday, St James’ bid to continue their incredible start to the season by dumping the holders out of the Steel and Sons Cup. However, Murphy is expecting a tough battle from the North Belfast side given that Newington went on to defeat Linfield Swts in last year’s Christmas Day final at Seaview. “They are a very dogged team and they work hard for each other. They are able to take their chances when they get them,” added the St James’ Swts assistant. “We also know they are the champions of this competition and they’re no going to let go of it easily. “We played them in pre-season and we won that game -, but they signed well after that game. “We know we are going to be up against it and it will be a real test. “We have to be at our best, but the way we are playing, I thinkwe show up on the day, we can win the game.” Newington will be without the suspended duo of Gavin Taggart and Kevin Bradley for Saturday’s clash while St James’ Swts are set to be at full strength for the quarter-final tie."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sf%e2%80%88asked to take","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw has called for the removal of the election-style anti-Brexit posters erected by Sinn Féin in parts of the constituency.

PA Andrew ParsonsCoronation Street actor Charlie Lawson has lent his backing to the campaign.Following meetings with Northern Ireland’s public transport provider Translink, the company has offered a compromise option of inserting a window into the wall to allow the cenotaph to be visible to the public.Campaigner William McQuade has described the development as a “small but signicant victory” for lower north Belfast.He described it as particularly fitting  years on from the end of the Great War.Now Mr McQuade has launched a fundraising campaign to cover the costs of making the cenotaph visible.He has argued that a visible cenotaph will help attract more tourists into the area, and show the area’s shared history of service and sacrice from all sides of the communities that reside there.“Having servedthis is something that I can say with full conviction that I am personally passionate about and I can honestly say this said monument just behind the works wall should be on public display,” he said.“I have known about it from a child and often wondered why this is not on display, taking into consideration that whilst we have a shared past that can be contentious at times both sides fought and died side by side regardless of race, class or creed.”A previous request for the war memorial to be moved to a site on the Shore Road was unsuccessful.The war memorial was originally erected by the Midland Railway Company at York Street station to commemorate railway staff who lost their lives in the Great War. When the station underwent redevelopment, it was moved to Carrickfergus.During work at Carrickfergus in the early s, the war memorial was moved to York Road engineering facility, where it remains.A Translink spokesman said: “Following signicant interest from members of the public we are working with community representatives on plans which will make the cenotaph located within NI Railways York Road engineering site more visible to the public.“NI Railways does facilitate people wishing to view the cenotaph at York Road, and the laying of poppy wreaths, to commemorate railway workers from the local area who died during the World Wars.“There is an annual Remembrance Day service held at the cenotaphwhich is open for all members of the public to attend”."},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\".

At least one legislator ought to try the stuff before we change the law!Posted by Senator Jim Dabakis on Saturday, October , So, he took the trip to neighbouring Nevada, where marijuana is legal for recreational use, and headed for a dispensary.Settling on an edible – half a gummy, to be precise – because he hates smoke, he proceeded to consume it while broadcasting live on Facebook, saying: “We’re looking at major changes in Utah law and at least one legislator ought to see what this thing is all about.”The senator gave further updates in the comments to his video, confirming that he did indeed have the second half of the sweet, that he was feeling a “little buzz” and that he went to see Cirque du Soleil that evening.There was no word about whether his earlier activities enhanced his enjoyment of the show.A couple of days later Dabakis checked back in on Facebook to give a more detailed report on his findings.

But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process. But the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Gold for James at cyclo cross race in Belfast  ","story":"A LARGE number of Dromara riders competed in round five of the Ulster Cyclo-Cross series in Musgrave park on Sunday, the event organised by VC Glendale.It was a rainy start to the day, but it did not dampen the spirits of Dromararsquos young riders.Hugh Hetherington, Tom Cowan and Anna Armstrong were the first to take to the course in the U- race.

Delamont already has stunning picturesque walks, a childrenrsquos adventure playground, miniature railway and cafe, but more investment is needed to enhance what it has to offer.Cllr Walker said creating new attractions will increase the parkrsquos profile and attract even more visitors.He added: ldquoI have always argued Delamont offers massive tourist potential and that with some imaginative thinking and new investment, it can rival any country park in Ireland. That is how special this place is..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Naomi backing campaign for much needed meningitis research  ","story":"SINN Fein councillor Naomi Bailie is one of three local meningitis survivors who are spearheading a fundraising drive to aid vital research into this potentially killer disease.Itrsquos nearly two years since the young mother from Ballygalget battled for her le in hospital after she developed the most serious kind of meningitis.After months of medical investigations due to her chronic headaches, it was an ear infection which eventually developed into full-blown bacterial meningitis on December , .She spent  weeks critically ill in hospital, away from her nine month-daughter Niadh as her husband Gerard, and her parents Sheila and Martin, and the rest of their families, prayed for her.Itrsquos only now that the  year-old, who was the inaugural chairperson of Newry, Mourne and Down District Council in , is phasing herself back into her role as a councillor for Downpatrick.However, her illness has left Naomi with some signicant repercussions.ldquoI have since been diagnosed with epilepsy and thatrsquos as a direct result of brain surgery that I had, she explains.ldquoI had a stroke during one of the surgeries and as a result of that, Irsquove been left with several blood clots on my brain. The meningitis also caused fluid on my blood which caused a tumour, so I now also live with that in my brain.ldquoItrsquos just been horric. The last year and a half has been dficult but we are getting out the other end of it now thankfully.Naomi says that the tumour and blood clots are successfully treated and controlled with medication.However, she adds: ldquoThe epilepsy is a bigger issue for me to live with me from day to day. As Niadh was so little, I was watched by Social Services when I came home from hospital as I wasnrsquot allowed to be with her unsupervised for a long time.ldquoThat took away a lot of time from me where she and I should have been bonding and thatrsquos time I will never get back, she says.ldquoI wasnrsquot able to drive as well and I felt a major loss of independence from that.ldquoIrsquove been seizure free for over a year now and have been allowed to drive again since July which is a real blessing as I found that really dficult.Naomi has also had to deal with her physical appearance changing due to the meningitis.She put on five stone in weight while in hospital and had to have her long hair shaved off for surgery.ldquoPsychologically that really affects people and I think it especially affects women. As I was always in the public eye, it was dreadful, said Naomi.ldquoIrsquove lost about half of the weight that I put on and have still about two and a half stone to lose yet.ldquoBecause of the stroke, I also wasnrsquot able to walk when I got home and I wasnrsquot talking right.

She loved her dress and having everyone there and danced the whole night. She loved her cake and all the party food.ldquoIt was great to be able to share some of the positive aspects of Meganrsquos le with our family, friends and supporters as there has been so much dficulty along the way.It was very much a family affair attended by Meganrsquos siblings, Hannah, Lily and Stuart, great grandmother Mrs Rosaleen Traynor and her aunt Kelly, who provides a lot of her care.Megan will never have the le that she should have had because of her condition.In many ways, even though the Traynors went on to have three other children who donrsquot have the condition, they were robbed of their hopes and dreams for their first-born.But Megan and her parents felt that it was only right that they should include people at the party who have helped them along their journey so far.In  more than pound, was raised to help Megan become one of the first children from the UK to have pioneering stem cell treatment in China.Unlike some other children who benefited from the controversial treatment, it did not cure or help Meganrsquos blindness.But the Traynors believe that it did help Megan in her mental development at the time, although that has now halted.When her epilepsy and major seizures began to impact on her already compromised quality of le, the local community again rallied around in  to help the Traynors create a safe back garden with sensory equipment, complete with a small hydrotherapy pool to help calm her.Leanne knows that they have been blessed with a lot of help, support and generosity from the local community.ldquoAll I know is that there are a lot of very good people in the Downpatrick area who really pull together when people need help, said Leanne.ldquoThey are people who have helped us and raised money, or who helped get us equipment or whatever, every time we needed it.

It is vitally important the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site is used for the benefit of the community,he continued.ldquoAny future planning applications will involve a consultation process that enables the public to have their say on the future development.The Downpatrick councillor suggested that given the current parking and traffic flow issues at Edward Street, there was a need for an ultra-modern primary school in the town to continue to provide a high standard of childrenrsquos education.He declared: ldquoI believe the St Dillonrsquos Avenue site would be ideal for a new school development and will be writing to the Education Authority to ask that they investigate the sitersquos potential for such a development.ldquoI will also be asking Newry, Mourne and Down Council to review options for this site as it could also be ideal for other community facilities.A spokesman for the diocese of Down and Connor confirmed on Monday that the former St Patrickrsquos Boys Primary School site will be placed on the market for sale.He added: ldquoThe diocesan Trustees are legally bound to act in the best interests of the charity and to consider all offers made through the public market process.ldquoIn the case of sales of former school sites, the diocesan Trustees are required toa substantial percentage of the sale price to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.A number of people have taken to social media in the wake of news that the former school site is to be sold and expressed concern about the impact its redevelopment could have on an already heavily congested part of the town.Several have suggested a new school should be built on the site, while others believe its redevelopment could have problems securing planning permission given the topography of this part of the town and traffic congestion in nearby Edward Street.A number of people said they would not be in favour of any form of retail development at the former school site..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Staff being followed home by unruly teenagers  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick have revealed that some members of staff have been followed home by unruly teenagers who are terrorising the town centre with their behaviour.The worrying revelation came during a meeting held last week to discuss mounting concern about increasing anti-social behaviour in St Patrickrsquos Square, the Grove shopping centre area and other parts of the town.Within  hours of last weekrsquos meeting concluding, a firework was thrown at a customer as he left a hot food bar in St Patrickrsquos Square, narrowly missing him.Business owners fear someone is going to have to be seriously injured or worse before the ongoing trouble is addressed.They say the anti-social behaviour cannot be allowed to continue in the area, or in any other part of Downpatrick, and insist there must be immediate action to be bring the trouble to an end.Last weekrsquos meeting between local police, business owners and elected representatives was organised by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has revealed there were a number of frank exchanges, with all those in attendance describing the talks as ldquoworthwhile.He also confirmed another session involving the parties is due to be held in mid-November.A businessman said it was ldquoentirely unsatisfactory that people who were trying to do a dayrsquos work should be terrorised by  and  year-old children operating outside the control of their parents and the police.ldquoIt is now getting dficult to recruit staff in Downpatrick town centre, he revealed.ldquoWe do not have these problems in Newcastle or Ardglass. Self-employed retailers pay tax and rates in an expectation that the government and Newry, Mourne and Down Council will ensure that the environment in our town centres is suitable for business and attractive to customers. We expect this situation to be turned around rapidly and not deteriorate further.During the meeting, business owners complained about having their staff harassed and having to close early, losing trade due to anti-social behaviour.Vehicles in the car park at the rear of the Grove shopping centre have been damaged, with business owners and local residentsrsquo group representatives expressing concern that police were not doing more to help bring about prosecutions.Residentsrsquo group members complained that they could no longer let their children play near the Grove or St Patrickrsquos Square, an area which they argued should be a major attraction in the town for adults and children alike.Fears were also expressed that this part of Downpatrick was now becoming ldquoout of bounds for the decent people in the town in the evenings.Cllr Enright said local police welcomed the opportunity to listen first-hand to what businesses and residentsrsquo associations had to say and agreed to meet met with them again next month to track progress in dealing with these issues.He also thanked South Down MLA Colin McGrath for attending the meeting and fellow MLA Emma Rogan for sending her apologies and confirming she will be at the November meeting.ldquoIt was clear that senior police officers were not aware of the scale of the problems in the town over the past nine months, Cllr Enright said.ldquoStatistics of reported crime did not reflect what was going on, with business owners surprised at the low number of prosecutions.ldquoThere appears to be a systemic problem in dealing with youth offending in the Public Prosecutions Service which insists on up to five repetitions of so-called lsquoyouth engagementrsquo by the police before considering bringing forward a prosecution.Cllr Enright suggested this left some of the worst culprits with little respect for or fear of the police.He confirmed that MLAs have been asked to raise this particular issue with the PPS, alongside concerns of people waiting up to  minutes to get through on the PSNIrsquos  number to report incidents.He said concern was also expressed about how reports of assaults, vandalism and intimidation were followed though, with some business owners keen for police to search young people whom they suspect of carrying fireworks.He added: ldquoThere was also criticism of the lsquoinvisibilityrsquo of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos community safety wardens, with some suggestions that robust action against anti-social behaviour issues at the Model Farm area may have been partly responsible for transferring the trouble to the town centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traffic ‘worse than ever’ amid calls for filter lane  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to address mounting concern about traffic snarl-ups at a busy junction on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Local people and politicians have been campaigning for a new filter lane at the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road which is dealing with a signicant increase in traffic at peak periods.Vehicles can be queued from the junction as far back as Bishops Brae in the morning with the upsurge attributed to the number of organisations now based at the Downshire Civic Centre.The public sector campus is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the PSNI, Housing Executive and Fire and Rescue Service. The Downe Hospital is also part of the sprawling estate.Mrs Olwyn McColl, who lives at Vianstown Heights, says there has been a major increase in traffic using the junction over the past year and is urging roads officials to address the problem.She says there is available land to provide a filter lane which has the potential to signicantly reduce tailbacks.ldquoThe problem is getting worse and sitting in a tailback, especially in the mornings when parents are taking children to school and people are heading to work, can be very frustrating, she said.ldquoDue to the current layout of the junction, drivers wishing to turn left at the junction have to wait until the traffic in front of them clears. A new filter lane would help reduce waiting times.Mrs McColl said it would appear that an increasing number of drivers heading from the Newcastle direction in the morning were now using the Ballynoe and Bishops Brae roads, which was contributing to the congestion.ldquoThe problem is  times worse than it ever was, there is no doubt about that, she continued. ldquoThings are bad now and they could get worse when the nearby new civic amenity site opens early next year.ldquoMany of my neighbours share my concern and it would be greatroads officials could use the land which is available to provide a new filter lane. It would make such a dference.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he shared the frustration of those campaigning for the filter lane which has not yet been delivered.ldquoIn addition to the nearby Downshire Civic Centre, we have a large shopping centre, a nursery and primary school, leisure facility and very busy MOT centre which is all adding to the build-up of traffic at peak periods, he said.ldquoWhile I am delighted Downpatrick has a major public sector campus, we need to ensure the roads system can cope with the additional volume of traffic its provision has generated. An important step would be upgrading the Ballynoe Road junction with the Killough Road.Cllr Curran believes a filter lane would not cost a signicant amount of money to provide and would go some way towards easing the current problem.ldquoThis particular junction is extremely busy in the morning, with a long tail back of vehicles a common occurrence. The creation of a filter lane allowing drivers wishing to turn left out of the Ballynoe Road would help reduce congestion, he said. lsquoThe provision of a new filter lane is a no brainer.Cllr Curran said that while roads officials previously identied a scheme to provide a new filter lane, they subsequently decided that, due to the close proximity of the Glebetown Drive housing area, a new slip road would cause ldquoroad safety issues.He added: ldquoI firmly believe that the time has come to revisit this particular proposal.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin.

Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.

It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension.
