Families split and you get on with your life.\u0027 When told that sounded cold, the actor replied \u0027Well, it is cold. Because life is cold.\u0027I don\u0027t find Sir Anthony\u0027s attitude that upsetting - probably because I had a whole host of problems with my own dysfunctional family. We were never close, and there were periods after I left home when we didn\u0027t speak for months, and then, one of us would hang up the phone in a fit of rage. A few years ago, I wrote best-selling book (Baggage) about my dreadul relationship with my mother, a difficult woman I never understood until after her death.REVEALED: Why Anthony Hopkins and his daughter have barely...Share this articleHundreds of women told me they had had difficult relationships with their mothers, and they had little in common. The relationship between fathers and their daughters is equally sacrosanct - if a parent dares to step out of line and tell the world that they can\u0027t stand their child, that they find it hard to be in the same room, that they have nothing in common, the world is disgusted, repulsed - you\u0027re not seen as \u0027human\u0027.Maybe this is because we live in an age of fake friendliness, people who you have only ever \u0027liked\u0027 on instagram or fakebook get rated as pals. We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/14/4C9E73ED00000578-5771503-image-a-18_1527255437250.jpg","title":"Weinstein hands NYPD biography book Broadway","story":"    Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein arrives at a New York City police department precinct with a pile of books under his arm          One of the books is Elia Kazan: A Biography, about the influential film and theater director from the late forties through the sixties          The other was Something Wonderful: Rodgers and Hammerstein\u0027s Broadway Revolution          The 66-year-old disgraced movie mogul seemed carefree as he was arrested, processed and booked for the alleged sexual assault of two women shortly after 7:30amKazan, who was once one of the most celebrated directors in Hollywood, but also had an epic fall from grace during the witch hunt by Sen.

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

(In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/24/16/4C978D4200000578-0-image-m-25_1527177301889.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment mischievous toddler caught trying copy mothers beauty regime","story":"Mylie Cain, three, was playing with her two-year-old sister April in the kitchen when she reached for the pink dyeThe 29-year-old believes that after seeing her colour her own hair earlier that week they decided to copy their mother and have a go themselves.Kylie said: \u0027I was gobsmacked, all Mylie\u0027s blonde curls had gone and turned light pink.

That firm, along with its peers, has been at the heart of the financial crisis and other debacles, but the auditors have largely escaped scrutiny.Now the mask is torn off in an explosive new book, Bean Counters by investigative journalist Richard Brooks. He has set out in unsparing detail how Britain’s largest audit firms have consistently turned a blind eye to scandals and wrongdoing, and not only got away with it, but also charged enormous fees.BIG SHOT OF THE WEEK: Santander\u0027s Ana Botin knows her way...Balfour Beatty is hit by row over fat cat pay after Chief...Sainsbury’s wages war on big suppliers as part of its...How on earth has BT chief earned a £1 million pay rise?...Now Netflix overtakes Disney to become the biggest media...Barclays board row over possible £61bn merger with rival...Share this articleAn audit – essentially an independent check of the books and systems – is a vital safeguard for shareholders, as well as for employees, customers and society as a whole. It is meant to give reassurance that the company in question is not about to go bust and that its accounts give a true and fair picture of its financial position.All too often, however, it does nothing of the sort – and when the auditors fail, we all suffer. Taxpayers are forced to foot the bill for bank bailouts. Black holes bloom in company pension funds. Small shareholders lose their shirts. Employees lose their jobs. Corporate tax revenues that could have financed schools and hospitals go unpaid.          Exclusive: The Number Twenty club for KPMG executivesxAnd all of these consequences could perhaps have been averted if only the auditors had sounded an alarm in time.The behaviour of the Big Four auditors – Deloitte, PwC and EY alongside KPMG – has been obscured by the veneer of prudence, even boringness, that they cultivate. Yet every single murky episode of recent years – from the implosion of RBS to the antics of the Crystal Methodist Paul Flowers at the Co-operative Bank to corruption at Fifa – has erupted with no advance warning.As Brooks points out, the top audit firms are riddled with conflicts of interest. Their huge fees act as an incentive for them to placate, rather than confront company bosses, and senior accountants themselves often go on to hold important roles in corporate Britain where they may stay loyal to their former colleagues.The failings of auditors came under inspection in the financial crisis but nothing happened. They are in the spotlight again for their role in the downfall of outsourcing firm Carillion. MPs earlier this month criticised KPMG for being complicit in ‘recklessness, hubris and greed’ at the company, which collapsed earlier this year under the weight of its debt. That affair has led to calls for draconian reforms to the audit firms. On past form, the bean-counters will walk away scot-free and continue to enrich themselves with impunity – unless they are finally called to account.          A former chieftain at Big Four auditor Deloitte, John Connolly is just one of the multi-millionaire partners who haunt the pages of Richard Brooks’ shocking exposéAs a 29-year-old junior auditor in PwC’s Luxembourg office in 2010, Deltour had stumbled across hundreds of secret ‘advance tax agreements’ between his firm’s clients and the Luxembourg tax authorities. In essence these were documents showing how the tax authorities had agreed to complicated schemes cooked up by PwC that would save the firms in question billions in tax.Sensationally, Deltour had found and copied more than 500 ‘rulings’ involving 350 companies. When he passed the information to a journalist in what became known as the ‘Luxleaks’ scandal, Deltour lifted the lid on one of the biggest ever tax avoidance factories in recent years. Another former PwC employee, office support worker Raphael Halet told a Luxembourg court in 2016 how the accountancy firm would send applications for approval on a Wednesday afternoon around 1.30pm to the director of the corporate tax office. PwC would draft not only the applications but also the taxman’s agreement letters, under the letterhead of the tax ision. The director had only to sign off, and literally rubber stamp the agreements.Tax avoidance isn’t new. The bricked-up windows still to be seen in old London houses tell of the reluctance in the 18th Century to pay window-tax. But in recent years, it has morphed from a relatively amateurish game into a worldwide industry – and the pioneers were the accountants. In an age of online transactions and globalisation it is easy for big companies to structure their businesses so the most profitable parts could be placed where they were lightly taxed.          Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7Companies such as Gap and Nike sold to customers around the world from tax-friendly locations such as the Netherlands. Drugs companies including GlaxoSmithKline held the rights to blockbuster pharmaceuticals in fiscally efficient locations. Now the big tech companies like Apple and Google save billions of dollars in taxes in much the same way – all with the advice of the Big Four accountancy firms.Caught offside Accountancy failure can allow corruption to go unnoticed for years. The canker silently rots business from within, and only occasionally erupts into public view. When it does, however, it can be spectacular. One such case began to unfold at 6am on May 27, 2015. When the sun rose over a serene Lake Zurich, plain-clothed Swiss police officers marched into the five-star Hotel Baur du Lac. Once inside, they woke seven of the world’s top ten football officials with arrest warrants.Hours later, the then US Attorney General Loretta Lynch unveiled a 161-page indictment against these and other FIFA officials, with offences from bribery to racketeering to money laundering alleged to have taken place over 20 years.How had the governing organisation of the biggest sport on earth got away with so much corruption for so long? A large part of the answer was that its auditors, KPMG, had allowed it to.From the start, when KPMG took on the audit in 1999, there should have been red flags. A year earlier, the then new president Sepp Blatter had repaid the Saudi football federation for their support in his election with a sum of 470,000 Swiss francs to an unidentified recipient, without authorisation from the relevant committee. No alarm was raised.But that was small beer compared with a decade later, in 2009, when payments adding up to $10 million were wired from FIFA accounts in Switzerland to Caribbean Football Union accounts at the Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.The accounts were controlled by former Trinidadian football executive Jack Warner, who has since been banned from the game for life. This was part of a scheme to bribe Warner into voting for South Africa’s successful bid to host the 2010 World Cup, according to the US Department of Justice.Again, KPMG raised no alarms, despite well-known question marks over Warner’s dealings. Nor did the audit firm speak out against a co-ordinated attempt by Blatter and two other former top officials in 2010 to enrich themselves through salary increases, World Cup bonuses and other incentives adding up to more than 79 million Swiss francs over five years.In October last year, Swiss audit regulators said ‘shortcomings’ had been found in KPMG’s work between 2008 and 2014 and one inidual was reprimanded.Bean Counters by Richard Brooks is published by Atlantic on June 7, priced £18.99.

In the programme, Mr Clark explains how the estate was landscaped to reflect the interests of the Duke of Edinburgh.           The hide is one of a matching ‘his and hers’ pair on the 20,000-acre Norfolk estate, with the other reserved for the Queen to observe wildfowl, waders and birds of preyHe says: ‘You get thousands of birds here in the winter.

The device comprises a collapsible iron brazier with three grills at varying heights for different cooking temperatures.It is set up near a bothy, or small hut, where the couple like to barbecue, with the Duke usually arriving first to light the coals, and the Queen driving herself to the spot about 30 minutes later with the salads.Balmoral housekeeper Sheena Stuart says: ‘The Prince, he barbecues, and this is his design.

UK car production rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 1970s and today provides more than 800,000 jobs in Britain.Why, then, am I filled with a sense of foreboding? Quite simply because I fear hardline Brexiteers are in danger of achieving what that rabble of militant trade unions failed to do: destroying the British car industry.In fact, I am even more worried than I was back then, when at least I could help fix the part of the industry I ran myself. Today, our fate lies in the hands of politicians whose negotiations threaten not just our own business but the whole British economy.Revealed: How letting an ambulance past can land motorists...Gardeners\u0027 World guest is accused of racism for calling the...Share this articleThat’s not just my view. I can assure you that the leaders of all the other big automotive firms agree that we are in real danger of damaging an industry we have spent decades rebuilding.At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril.Why? Allow me to explain. One of the biggest reasons the automotive industry failed in the 1970s is that supply chains were seriously disrupted and completely unpredictable, so costs soared and quality deteriorated.Modern supply chains need to be super-efficient. The car industry has been described as the most complex organisation of human endeavour on the planet, which is not surprising when you consider that there are more than 20 million variations of, for example, a Range Rover. Precisely the correct part must be available at the right time when the car moves down the production line.          At the heart of this crisis lies the issue of the frictionless trade we enjoy as part of the EU customs union. This allows components to pass freely between the Continent and the UK. If we leave the union, the survival of our car industry is in peril (file image)For example a red, right- hand, heated, electronic wing mirror must arrive for car number one and then, for car number two, a blue one with a different specification.These components come from all over the world, with the vast majority being sourced outside Europe. Car supply chains are particularly at risk of delay because 60 per cent of parts are imported. That equates to more than a thousand delivery lorries from the Continent to the UK every day.Take fuel tanks, for instance. People don’t stop to think about them, but of course you can’t get a car off a production line without one. Half of all the cars made in Britain rely on fuel tanks that come from Unipart’s factories in this country.It takes a long, long time to design and develop each tank. They are sophisticated and complex products with multiple components coming from continental Europe. All that could be thrown into expensive disarray if just one component is not there when we need it.The idea that we could start sourcing all the components for the fuel tanks in the UK just doesn’t work. We would love to, but it isn’t possible – if it were, we would already be doing it.The issue here is not one of border tariffs. The hard Brexiteers say that since German manufacturers want to sell their cars to us in the UK, there is no incentive for them to try to impose heavy tariffs after Brexit. Perhaps so. But that’s not the real problem.Tariffs hurt competitiveness and we don’t like that, but at least we can plan for them because they are quantifiable and predictable. Delays at border checkpoints, however, are disastrous precisely because they are so unpredictable.If we don’t know where a part is because it is stuck on a lorry in Europe and can’t get across the border, or they haven’t trained enough customs officials yet, then we have no certainty when it will arrive. The industry operates efficient ‘just-in-time’ practices so stock is not left lying around. That means we would normally have only enough parts at customers’ factories to keep the production lines running for just eight hours.But if the right part isn’t there when it is needed, you either have to send the car on and rework it afterwards, which is expensive and hurts quality, or you have to stop the production line. And that is very expensive, costing more than £1 million an hour – all for the sake of that single missing component.If we barrel headlong towards a hard Brexit, I fear such border delays are not only possible but inevitable, with the result that I believe the British motor industry will find it very difficult to survive in the long term.The hard Brexiteers prefer to avoid discussion of such practicalities, with talk of the UK forging new trade deals outside the EU. But again, it is more complex than that.For instance, a free-trade agreement with South Korea currently requires that cars we manufacture in the UK for export to Korea have 55 per cent of ‘local content’.Under the current rules, British-based car firms are allowed to count all EU components as being of local origin, even though only 25 per cent of them are typically sourced here. With a hard Brexit, I am not sure we can do that any longer, so the deal simply doesn’t work.Now do you understand why automotive bosses like me are so worried?But this is not just about the survival of firms such as mine, it is about the pounds in your pocket. The car industry benefits the UK economy to the tune of £200 billion a year and supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.Many people don’t realise that if the car industry fails, the economy will go with it. No one voted in the referendum to lose their jobs or their income.So what, then, can be done to avoid looming disaster. At the minimum, we must stay in the customs union. If the hard Brexiteers can find a credible and executable alternative, which deliver the same results, we need to see the evidence. There has been none so far.To press ahead without such a frictionless trade deal in place would be an act of wanton self-destruction.How tragic it would be if we had saved the British car industry from the grip of one damaging political ideology in the militant 1970s, only to lose it to another in 2018. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/23/14/4984EB0700000578-0-image-m-67_1519396707285.jpg","title":"Terrifying moment military jet flies just 90ft paraglider","story":"    The Royal Navy Hawk T1 flew between the four paragliders while on a practice bombing run at an adjacent military rangeThen as the Hawk soared above him and below his colleagues, he says nervously: ‘Like a wild man.

She returned two years later to train her camera on the streets on which she had grown up. Murtha, who her daughter, Ella, recalls as “spiky haired, and in baseball boots”, took this photograph in 1980 on the council estate of Elswick in Newcastle, while she was on a job training scheme for the unemployed.No bomb had recently fallen on Kenilworth Road in Elswick, but it might as well have done. In just over a year of Margaret Thatcher’s government, a million manufacturing jobs had been lost the west end of Newcastle was among the places worst hit. When Murtha’s pictures first appeared, her MP used them in parliament as evidence of the disturbing reality of life for those who had left school with no hope of work. The girl on the upturned chair, apparently sinking beneath the smoky rubble of her life, is Karen Lafferty her boyfriend at the time, “Robbo”, appears in other photographs in the series, including one in which he lies on the pavement, under graffiti reading “Cops Piss Off”.Though she never stopped taking pictures, Murtha published no books of photography in her lifetime. Her daughter has been archiving her mother’s pictures since Tish died suddenly aged 57, five years ago. Ella used Kickstarter to fund a book of the Elswick images, Youth Unemployment, and a retrospective of her work will open at the Photographer’s Gallery next month.

There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

Yet in its heyday Rochdale was one of the most prosperous places on earth. The town hall – a magnificent example of Victorian gothic – exudes civic pride. But it was built a long time ago, when Britain was the workshop of the world, cotton was king and the north of England was more prosperous than the south.Over the past century or more the economy’s centre of gravity has shifted and Rochdale faces problems familiar to many places on the wrong side of the geographical ide: how to replace old industries with new ones how to break out of a low-wage, low-skill pattern of employment how to persuade the young people leaving for university to come back when they have finished their studies.The policy response is fairly generic also improving the transport links, a targeted reduction in business rates to reduce vacancy rates, work under way on a combined retail and leisure complex, the marketing of the town’s history to attract tourists.Rochdale is different in one respect, however. Having been at its zenith during one machine age, it is now using another technological advance – machine learning – to measure local wellbeing.Traditionally, if a local authority wanted to gauge public opinion it would commission an opinion poll, an expensive way of capturing a snapshot of sentiment on any one day.The Rochdale feelgood factor does away with interviews and harnesses the power of social media instead. Thousands of tweets sent from the town are studied on a daily basis, with algorithms learning which words have a positive or negative context. Whereas the public don’t always respond entirely honestly to opinion pollsters, machine learning detects their true emotional state.The Bank of England is thinking along the same lines. In a recent speech about the possible uses of big data, Andy Haldane, Threadneedle Street’s chief economist, said researchers were already studying music choices from Spotify to test consumer confidence.Rochdale’s experiment is being conducted by the economist Paul Ormerod – born and raised in the borough – and his colleague Rickard Nyman, who have used machine learning to compile a London feelgood factor and to study the 2017 election.“Recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning enable wellbeing to be measured directly from social media,” Ormerod says. “This is not only considerably less expensive than traditional approaches – the algorithms do much of the work – but the results can be generated in real time.”While the Rochdale feelgood index has only been charted since Christmas last year, Ormerod and Rickard have been looking at how people feel in London since 15 June 2016, a week before the EU referendum.The study of tweets showed there was a sharp fall in the feelgood factor in the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, as might have been expected, given that London voted strongly for remain. There was another big drop in November that year when Donald Trump won the US presidential race.However, on both occasions sentiment quickly returned to its previous levels, suggesting that most people are not all that bothered by politics and once the excitement is over simply get on with their lives. This is consistent with the way in which consumer spending held up much better in the months after the referendum than most forecasters – including the Bank of England – predicted. Had the London feelgood index been available to the Bank in 2016, it might have thought twice about the need for an emergency cut in interest rates.Ormerod and Rickard used the same real-time twitter analysis for clients during last year’s general election. They found a strong correlation until just a few days before the poll between the proportion of tweets that mentioned Brexit as a topic and the Conservative lead in the polls.Theresa May called the election to strengthen her Brexit negotiating hand and for the first couple of weeks – when Brexit was the dominant issue – it looked as if the Conservatives were heading for a landslide. However, voters decided the election was not only about Brexit, and other issues – such as social care – started to show up more regularly in the analysis of tweets.Rochdale’s destiny will not be determined by a feelgood factor, even one generated by smart machines, because its problems are deep and of longstanding. Thus far, the only conclusions that can be drawn from it are ones that most people could work out for themselves: Rochdale is happier on a Friday than a Monday, happier at Christmas than in January – when the credit card bills come rolling in – and permanently less happy than London.It is early days, however. There was a spike in the feelgood factor when the borough was included in the Tour de Manc charity bike ride and the council wants to use the index to work out when it should hold events, how it carries out its services, how the public responds to its regeneration efforts and whether deprived parts of the borough register lower wellbeing.At a bare minimum, the machine learning experiment will help the council make better-informed judgements about how it spends money. The idea may well catch on. It’s been a while since where Rochdale led others followed.

It’ll prove this isn’t all a delusion – they can confirm it’s genuinely happening. Unless they’re a delusion too and there really isn’t time to get into that. People say it’s solipsistic which, from usage, seems to mean “best not thought about”. Unlike all the plastic in the sea, which is very troubling, and let’s hope someone noticed you reading a report on that as you sipped your Fairtrade espresso in an independent coffee shop while shaking your head sadly – no mean feat in itself.Perhaps you should take a photo, and put it on social media? Not a grinning selfie – that would be tonally wrong for the coffee house sophistication you want to put across. Put across because you’re genuinely feeling it, of course. How about a sort of POV shot? The coffee cup, the open newspaper, a sprinkling of croissant crumbs. Ooh, not the page about the Grenfell inquiry – that doesn’t feel right. Turn that over. One with a nice picture of a sunlit field, or a beach or a castle, and some lighter stories. That’s it – resprinkle the croissant crumbs and… is that the time? Quick, you’ve got to go in a minute. And… move the car key out of shot. It’s a Ford so not… I mean, an Alfa Romeo key would… Anyway, there we go: snap. Hashtag LazyWeekend hashtag chilling. Christ, you’re really late now.This urge to self-photograph and upload, to document and publish our every significant experience, was in the news again last week when it was reported that several holiday companies are marketing “Instagram-friendly tours”, catering for “ego travellers” among the millennial generation. This came hard on the heels of Thomas Cook’s announcement that it’s “exploring options for the future” of Club 18-30, options that include selling it. So, millennials would rather pull a duck face in front of Machu Picchu than go to Magaluf for 30 units of alcohol a day and an increased chance of contracting herpes. The message seems to be: young people today are still awful, but in a different way.Irritation at relentless holiday photography has its roots in mildly xenophobic 1980s moaning about Japanese tourists with stovepipe cameras, but has greatly intensified in the era of the smartphone. “Why can’t they just experience it?!” goes the middle-aged cry. “If you’re photographing or filming something, you’re not immersed in it. Just look and remember.”This view is backed up by research. A 2013 study found that people who went round a museum photographing things, rather than just looking at them, remembered much less about what they’d seen. But of course they’ve got pictures of everything, so they don’t need to. And a 2017 review of research “Exploring the Links between Mobile Technology Habits and Cognitive Functioning” found that our brains aren’t bothering to retain stuff if they think we’ll be able to access it through our devices. Certainly Google Maps is playing havoc with my ability to find my way around town without it. Then again, I also can’t start a fire without matches and have no idea how to skin an animal, so my whole not-relying-on-technology ship has long since sailed.Despite all this, I have sympathy for the obsessive photographers. Existing as we do in a maelstrom of documentation, it’s easy to feel that a memory isn’t evidence enough that something happened. It’s too dreamlike. I try to walk for an hour every day as exercise, and my phone automatically logs a distance and step count. As a result, I have come to feel, if not quite believe, that if I go for a walk without my phone, it hasn’t really happened. I won’t see it in the app, so how can I get the benefit? It would be like trying to claim money back without a receipt.I agree that the best way to enjoy a holiday is to unselfconsciously “be in the moment”. But the trouble is, once it’s occurred to you to take a picture, whatever you then do is already self-conscious. Taking it or not taking it. In fact you could argue that, by that point, it’s more unselfconscious to take the photo, rather than to deliberately suppress the urge and stand there, phone hand twitching, telling yourself it’s mindfulness.I generally find that tourists who relentlessly photograph their experiences, instead of just living them, nevertheless seem quite content with their choice. Meanwhile the just-remember-it brigade spend a lot of time crossly muttering about other people’s cameraphones – partly because their view of the waterfallfireworkstemplecar crash is being obstructed, but largely because the rest of the human race is just incredibly annoying. Neither group is “in the moment”, but at least the former gets some nice photos.Both are placing too much emphasis on memories: is it better to have a comprehensive photographic record to look at, or a memory unsullied by artificial preservatives? But I don’t think memories are the point of a holiday. Remembering something fun that’s finished is sad. What’s nice about a holiday, apart from actually going on it, is looking forward to it. It’s anticipation of next weekend, not memories or photographs of last, that gets you through the working week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eaeec3bf99d7b3b66141bf3c6b8da04a3f87147/12_0_3874_2324/master/3874.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9538165bc9c4e3491e1309d6768600e","title":"world distraction demands new focus","story":"Imagine that you’ve just bought a new GPS device for your car. The first time you use it, it works as expected. However, on the second journey, it takes you to an address a few blocks away from where you had wanted to go. On the third trip, you’re shocked when you find yourself miles away from your intended destination, which is now on the opposite side of town. Frustrated, you decide to return home, but when you enter your address, the GPS gives you a route that would have you driving for hours and ending up in a totally different city.Like any reasonable person, you would consider this GPS faulty and return it to the store – if not throw it out of your car window. Who would continue to put up with a GPS that they knew would take them somewhere other than where they wanted to go? What reason could\u0026nbspanyone possibly have for continuing to tolerate such a thing?No one would put up with this sort of distraction from a technology that directs them through physical space. Yet we do precisely this, on a daily basis, when it comes to the technologies that direct us through informational space. We have a curiously high tolerance for poor navigability when it comes to our attentional GPSs – those technologies that direct our thoughts, our actions and our lives.Think for a moment about the goals you have set for yourself: your goals for reading this essay, for later today, for this week, even later this year and beyond. If you’re like most people, they’re probably goals such as “learn how to play piano”, “spend more time with family”, “plan that trip I’ve been meaning to take” and so on.These are real goals, human goals. They’re the kinds of goals that, when we’re on our deathbeds, we’ll regret not having accomplished. If technology is for anything, it’s for helping us pursue these kinds of goals.A few years ago, I read an article called Regrets of the Dying. It was about a businesswoman named Bronnie Ware whose disillusionment with the daily slog of her trade had led her to leave it and to start working in a different place: in rooms where people were facing their final hours. She spent her days attending to their needs and listening to their regrets and she recorded the most common things they wished they’d done, or hadn’t done, in life: they’d worked too hard, they hadn’t told people how they felt, they hadn’t let themselves be happy and so on. This, it seems to me, is the proper perspective – the one that’s truly our own. It’s the perspective that our screens and machines ought to help us circle back on again and again: because whatever we might choose to want, nobody chooses to want to regret.Think back on your goals from a moment ago. Now try to imagine what your technologies’ goals are for you. What do you think they are? I don’t mean the companies’ mission statements and high-flying marketing messages – I mean the goals on the dashboards in their product design meetings, the metrics they’re using to direct your attention, to define what success means for your life. How likely is it that they reflect the goals you have for yourself?Not very likely, I’m sorry to say. From their perspective, success is almost always defined in the form of low-level “engagement” goals, as they’re often called. These include things like maximising the amount of time you spend with their product, keeping you clicking or tapping or scrolling as much as possible, or showing you as many pages or ads as they can. But these “engagement” goals are petty, subhuman goals. No person has these goals for themselves. No one wakes up in the morning and asks: “How much time can I possibly spend using social media today?” (If there is someone like that, I’d love to meet them and understand their mind.)What this means, though, is that there’s a deep misalignment between the goals we set for ourselves and the goals that many of our information technologies have for us. This seems to me to be a really big deal and one that no one talks about nearly enough. We trust these technologies to be companion systems for our lives: we trust them to help us do the things we want to do, to become the people we want to be. We trust them to be on our side.Yet these wondrous machines, for all their potential, have not been on our side. Our goals have not been their goals. Rather than supporting our intentions, they have largely sought to grab and keep our attention. In their cut-throat rivalry for the increasingly scarce prize of “persuading” us, of shaping our thoughts and actions in accordance with their predefined goals, they have been forced to resort to the cheapest, pettiest tricks in the book, appealing to the lowest parts of us, to the lesser selves that our higher natures perennially struggle to overcome. Furthermore, they now deploy in the service of this attentional capture and exploitation the most intelligent systems of computation the world has seen.If you wanted to train all of society to be as impulsive and weak-willed as possible, how would you do it? One way would be to invent an impulsivity training device – let’s call it an iTrainer – that delivers an endless supply of informational rewards on demand. You’d want to make it small enough to fit in a pocket or purse so people could carry it anywhere they went. The informational rewards it would pipe into their attentional world could be anything, from cute cat photos to tidbits of news that outrage you (because outrage can, after all, be a reward too). To boost its effectiveness, you could endow the iTrainer with rich systems of intelligence and automation so it could adapt to users’ behaviours, contexts and inidual quirks in order to get them to spend as much time and attention with it as possible.So let’s say you build the iTrainer and distribute it gradually into society. At first, people’s willpower would probably be pretty strong and resistant. The iTrainer might also cause awkward social situations, at least until enough people had adopted it so that it was widely accepted. But if everyone were to keep using it over several years, you’d probably start seeing it work pretty well. Now, the iTrainer might make people’s lives harder to live: it would no doubt get in the way of the effective pursuit of their desired tasks and goals. Even though you created it, you probably wouldn’t let your kids use one. But from the point of view of your design goals, ie making the world more impulsive and weak-willed, it would probably be a roaring success.Then what if you wanted to take things even further? What if you wanted to make everyone even more distracted, angry, cynical – and even unsure of what, or how, to think? What if you wanted to troll everyone’s minds? You’d probably create an engine, a set of economic incentives, which would make it profitable for other people to produce and deliver these rewards – and, where possible, you’d make these the only incentives for doing so. You don’t want just any rewards to get delivered – you want people to receive rewards that speak to their impulsive selves, rewards that are the best at punching the right buttons in their brains. For good measure, you could also centralise the ownership of this design as much as possible.If you’d done all this 10 years ago, right about now you’d probably be seeing some interesting results. You’d probably see nine out of 10 people never leaving home without their iTrainer. 1) Almost half its users would say they couldn’t even live without their device. 2) You’d probably see them using it to access most of the information they consume, across every context of life: from politics to education to celebrity gossip and beyond. You’d probably find they were using the iTrainer hundreds of times per day, spending a third of their waking lives engaged with it and it would probably be the first and last thing they engaged with every day.If you wanted to train society to be as weak-willed and impulsive as possible, you could do a whole lot worse than this. In any event, after unleashing the iTrainer into the world, it would be absurd to claim that it hadn’t produced significant changes in the thoughts, behaviour and habits of its users. After all, everyone would have been part of a rigorous impulsivity training programme for many years.What’s more, this programme would have effectively done an end-run around many of our other societal systems: it would have opened a door directly on to our attentional capacities and become a primary lens through which we see the world. It would, of course, be a major undertaking to try to understand the full story of the effects this project had had on people’s lives – not only as iniduals, but also for society as a whole. It would certainly have had major implications for the way we had been collectively discussing and deciding questions of great importance. And it would certainly have given us, as did previous forms of media, political candidates who were made in its image.Of course, the iTrainer project would never come anywhere close to passing a research ethics review. Launching such a project of societal reshaping, and letting it run unchecked, would clearly be utterly outrageous. So it’s a good thing this is all just a thought experiment.The Canadian media theorist Harold Innis once said that his entire career’s work proceeded from the question: “Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?” When I was working in the technology industry, I realised that I’d been woefully negligent in asking this question about my own attention. When I started doing so, I began to see with new eyes the dashboards, metrics and goals that were driving much of its design. These were the destinations we were entering into the GPSs guiding the lives of millions of human beings. I soon came to understand that the technology industry wasn’t designing products it was designing users. These magical, general-purpose systems weren’t neutral “tools” they were purpose-driven navigation systems guiding flesh-and-blood human lives. They were extensions of our attention.The new challenges we face in the Age of Attention are, on both inidual and collective levels, challenges of self-regulation. Having some limits is inevitable in human life. In fact, limits are necessary if we are to have any freedom at all. Like the iTrainer in my thought experiment, digital technologies have transformed our experiential world into a never-ending flow of potential informational rewards. They’ve become the playing field on which everything now competes for our attention. Similar to economic abundance, “if these rewards arrive faster than the disciplines of prudence can form, then self-control will decline with affluence: the affluent (with everyone else) will become less prudent” (as Avner Offer writes in The Challenge of Affluence).In a sense, information abundance requires us to invert our understanding of what “information technologies” do: rather than overcoming barriers in the world, they increasingly exist to help us put barriers in place. The headphone manufacturer Bose now sells a product called Hearphones that allows the user to block out all sounds in their environment except the ones coming from their desired source – to focus on a conversation in a loud room, for example. The product’s website reads: “Focus on the voices you want to hear – and filter out the noises you don’t – so you can comfortably hear every word. From now on, how you hear is up to you.” We could also read this tagline as a fitting description of the new challenges in the Age of Attention as a whole.The increasing rate of technological change further amplifies these challenges of attention and self-regulation. Historically, new forms of media took years, if not generations, to be adopted, analysed and adapted to. Today, however, new technologies can arrive on the scene and rapidly scale to millions of users in the course of months or even days.The constant stream of new products this unleashes – along with the ongoing optimisation of features within products already in use – can result in a situation in which users are in a constant state of learning and adaptation to new interaction dynamics, familiar enough with their technologies to operate them, but never so fully in control that they can prevent the technologies from operating on them in unexpected or undesirable ways. This keeps us living on what I sometimes call a “treadmill of incompetence”.What do you pay when you pay attention? You pay with all the things you could have attended to, but didn’t: all the goals you didn’t pursue, all the actions you didn’t take and all the possible yous you could have been, had you attended to those other things. Attention is paid in possible futures foregone. You pay for that extra Game of Thrones episode with the heart-to-heart talk you could have had with your anxious child. You pay for that extra hour on social media with the sleep you didn’t get and the fresh feeling you didn’t have the next morning. You pay for giving in to that outrage-inducing piece of clickbait about that politician you hate with the patience and empathy it took from you and your anger at yourself for allowing yourself to take the bait in the first place.We pay attention with the lives we might have lived. When we consider the opportunity costs in this wider view, the question of “attention” extends far beyond the next turn in your life’s GPS: it encompasses all the turns and their relations, the nature of your destination, the specific way you want to get there, why you’re going there and also your ability to ask any of these questions in the first place. In this view, the question of attention becomes the question of having the freedom to navigate your life in the way you want, across all scales of the human experience.But I also knew this wasn’t just about me – my freedom, my attention, my deep distractions, my frustrated goals. Because when most people in society use your product, you aren’t just designing users – you’re designing society. But if all of society were to become as distracted in this new, deep way as I was starting to feel, what would that mean? What would be the implications for our shared interests, our common purposes, our collective identities, our politics?Some threats to freedom we recognise immediately others take time to reveal themselves for what they are. For too long, we’ve minimised the personal and political threats of this intelligent, adversarial persuasion as mere “distraction” or minor annoyance. In the short term, these challenges can indeed frustrate our ability to do the things we want to do. In the longer term, however, they can make it harder for us to live the lives we want to live or, even worse, undermine fundamental capacities such as reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of philosopher Harry Frankfurt, to “want what we want to want”. Seen in this light, these new attentional adversaries threaten not only the success, but even the integrity of the human will, at both inidual and collective levels.I used to think there were no great political struggles left. The truly epic defences of freedom, I thought, had been fought and won by generations greater than my own, leaving to my time only the task of dutifully administering our hard-earned political inheritance. I was ready to live in a world where my own great struggles would take place primarily in the memories, the simulations of the old ones. I was prepared to find new ways of satisfying the need for struggle in the face of a world that no longer demanded it. I used to think the big political questions had more or less been answered.How wrong I was. I now believe the liberation of human attention may be the defining moral and political struggle of our time. It is a first-order problem its success is a prerequisite to the success of virtually all other struggles. We therefore have an obligation to rewire the system of intelligent, adversarial persuasion we have inherited before it rewires us.Doing so requires hacking together new ways of talking and thinking about the problem, as well as summoning the courage necessary for advancing on it in inconvenient and unpopular ways. I know that this courage exists – the open question is whether, in this world of torrential distraction, it can still receive a proper hearing.• James Williams is the author of Stand Out of Our Light: Freedom and Resistance in the Attention Economy (CUP)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f453131725440655be16253eaf87cd0009540b5b/446_359_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b5b5765ee9f70456fe559078ce723b","title":"laura linney interview my name is lucy barton london stage debut","story":"id-morning in Brooklyn, New York and grey clouds are scudding across the sky above St Ann’s Warehouse – a state-of-the-art performance and rehearsal space that was once a tobacco warehouse. Inside, a fabulous model of an angel is suspended from the ceiling, and beyond its windows the East River is getting on with its day. Laura Linney is said to be running late and when she arrives she walks in briskly without any a-esque hauteur. She is all apologies, smiles, grace. She sits down on a circular leather banquette in the foyer and tucks her knees beneath her. She is casually dressed but with a black-and-white scarf for extra flourish. She looks comfortable in her own skin. At 54, there is a much younger woman visible in her face and not because of cosmetic interference but because she is spirit itself –you see that at once.She is in New York, but the next opportunity to catch Linney will be in London, at the Bridge theatre. She is about to star in an adaptation of the American novelist Elizabeth Strout’s My Name Is Lucy Barton, long-listed for the Booker in 2016, adapted by Rona Munro and directed by Richard Eyre. It is a first-person narrative of Quakerish composure, slightly reminiscent of Marilynne Robinson’s work, about a woman who is a born writer, who carries the burden of the unspeakable: her childhood. It is about writing and what cannot be written. It centres, movingly, on an encounter over Lucy Barton’s New York hospital bed (she is recovering from an operation) with her mother – this offers a chance to revisit her childhood and, possibly, to redeem it. The play is not, as you might predict, a two-hander, but more dauntingly, a monologue, a 37-page marathon – Linney will be carrying more than the burden of her character’s childhood, she will be carrying the show.Sometimes, in life, things are meant to be: Laura Linney and Lucy Barton seem to have been intended for one another. This was, however, far from clear at the outset: “I received a call from my agent, who said Elizabeth Strout wanted to meet with me about the possibility of playing Lucy Barton. We met in a cafe on the Upper East Side. We had a wonderful lunch but there were these weird, awkward pauses during which we were staring at each other across the table.”At one point, Strout broached it: “So you want to play Lucy Barton?” Linney responded: “I’d love to.” But no further discussion developed. Linney discovered only later that there had been “some confusion” – each woman had expected the other to be doing the pitching. “I fell in love with Liz at that lunch, she was amazing. But I thought: oh well, this was not meant to be.”It was months after that first meeting with Strout, while Linney was in Atlanta shooting Ozark (the Netflix crime series in which she plays the unfaithful wife of Jason Bateman’s drug money launderer), that she got a call from Nicholas Hytner, director (and co-founder of London’s Bridge theatre), saying he had optioned the novel and wanted her to do it.“I asked: ‘Have you spoken to Liz?’ He said: ‘No.’ I said: ‘You’re kidding me.’” She could not believe that Lucy Barton had come back to claim her from a new direction. The show would be with Eyre directing, whom she “adores”, and Bob Crowley designing (ditto) and an overseeing Nicholas Hytner, whom she reveres, and in this “brand new theatre”. She cocks her head to one side, bird-like, and smiles.You can understand why more than one person thought her ideal casting for Lucy Barton. Receptive, damaged, contemplative, the character is perfectly suited to Linney’s talent for nuance – for splintered emotion. It was the television series of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City that made her name in 1993 – Linney was the ingenue that 1970s San Francisco took under its seductive wing. In 2003, she excelled as the amorously diffident Sarah in Love Actually, and her role as Abigail Adams, wife of the second US president, in the HBO mini-series John Adams (2008) won her an Emmy. Yet in most – if not quite all – of her films, Laura Linney is caught up in dysfunctional families.In You Can Count on Me (2000) – for which she was nominated for an Oscar – she played sister to a delinquent brother. Her expressive face is brilliant at conveying ambivalence, with her piercingly warm smile an unexpectedly powerful accessory. By 2005, in The Squid and the Whale, she was a wan, tormented neurotic. And in Savages (2007) she evolved – or devolved – still further (“That character was a hot mess,” says Linney). A pathological liar, she kept her brother (Philip\u0026nbspSeymour\u0026nbspHoffman) company visiting their demented father – two siblings at sea.At one point in Strout’s novel, Lucy Barton considers life in contrast to fiction: “When you write a novel, you get to rewrite it, but when you live with someone for 20 years that is the novel.” To what extent does Linney see her own life as a story? “It depends on the age you are when you look back – your perspective changes.” Her eyes shine: “I guess we can all tell our lives as stories – but it is whether or not you want to.” She laughs – a peel of a laugh. And do you? “No!” she exclaims. Life, she suggests, is not docile enough to coax into a shape: “Life is mysterious and unpredictable and exhilarating and\u0026nbsppainful.”Would she agree that what Strout is suggesting is that it is impossible ever to know anyone? “Yes – the novel asks questions I’ve been asking myself filming Ozark recently, particularly given the political climate of my country right now. Who am I? Who are you? Who are we? What do I believe in? What – who – do I love? And why? How do I choose to spend my time? What helps me evolve? What do I need?” Hearing her restlessly interview herself in this manner, one thing is obvious: Linney will never be accused of complacency.What’s more, in a recent interview in W magazine, she says that what she particularly loves about Ozark is how, within the family, none of them know each other – or themselves. How well does she know herself? “I know parts of myself. The joy about getting older is that you learn a bit about yourself. But I believe that being too knowing can be a problem. If you’re too knowing, you limit yourself from the get-go. There is a Chinese expression: I only know enough.” She maintains there are “people who have known me for a long time who know my behaviour better than I do, who have watched me change and stay the same. For there is a core in all of us that does not change – not at all.” Linney speaks with pinpoint precision – as if in italics.She sees My Name Is Lucy Barton as “truth unadorned”. And if Strout offers us a further moral insight, it is that it is wrong to judge others. Lucy Barton observes that people “find ways to feel superior to another person, another group of people. It happens everywhere, and all the time. Whatever we call it, I think it is the lowest part of who we are, this need to find someone else to put down.” Linney says: “Hmph...” – a favourite response, almost Mary Poppins-ish, it makes me laugh – “One thing I know is that no one is one thing. That I know. Judgment has become entertainment – easy and unhelpful. Judgment is about selling, it is not meant to change anything.”There is one judgment I am keen to hear from her – of Richard Eyre as a director. Linney always claims in interviews that, in spite of her film and television success, she is instinctively a theatre person. She was directed by Eyre in a 2002 production of The Crucible, for which she received a Tony nomination. (More recently she was nominated for another Tony for her performance in Little Foxes on Broadway in 2017 with Cynthia Nixon). “Richard is a man of the arts,” she says. “He is beautifully balanced as a director – his attention to narrative, design and acting.” And then she comes up with a surprising word: she describes him as an “unbelievable host”. Does that extend to how he makes her feel when directed? “Yes,” she says. And she reveals that Elizabeth Strout and Rona Munro are welcomed into rehearsals too.It is Linney’s upbringing that has perhaps given her the greatest insight into family and its challenges. She is the only child of a single mother, Miriam Anderson “Ann” Perse, who worked as a nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a cancer hospital in East Manhattan. Linney grew up in a one-bedroom apartment: “My mother was balancing so much, she was remarkable – she did not have an easy time. She was working 12-hour shifts at the hospital. And she was so young, she had me at 24. I often think of what it must have been like for her. She is still alive – very much so – and loves being a grandmother. I think she had given up on it ever happening. Bennett is a great gift to us all.”Her father was a playwright, Romulus Linney – winner of two national critics awards. She has described him in interviews as a wonderful but “difficult” man. When I ask whether her love of acting began with him, she replies: “I’d love to tell you it had nothing to do him, that it just came from me but that would be completely ridiculous. It had a tremendous amount to do with him.” She then adds that it might also have been in the genes: “His being a man of the theatre came from his mother – an amateur actress. My great-great-grandfather was a senator and congressman for North Carolina and known as an orator.”Linney was privately educated (relatives helped with fees) and studied theatre arts at Brown University before getting into the Juilliard School in New York. “I’m very lucky because I always knew what I wanted to do and have been able to continue to work.” But to be an actor you must have the “right disposition – it is hard work and does not always feel good. The lesson I have learned, over and over, is that you have to sit in discomfort – physically and psychologically. You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. In a world that does not value time or the patience required for something to develop, things do not always go well. Sometimes work has to be terrible before it gets better.”I think of Linney playing opposite Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. She is an artificially perfect wife, shiny as her kitchen appliances, a new-improved cipher with a just-add-sugar smile. That must have been a task and a half. And now she confesses that she predicts it will only be at the end of the Lucy Barton run that she will feel “ready to do it”.You can’t watch Laura Linney without thinking about her technique – that incredible ability to cry at will in front of cameras: “It is about doing all your work before you get there and then throwing it out the window, knowing it will bleed through. I do a lot of prep – then surrender.” She adds, with italicised precision: “You just have to get out of your own way.” She sees becoming Lucy Barton as getting out of the character’s way. “I see myself as a medium,” she adds.What keeps coming up in our conversation is Linney’s willingness not to be an expert on herself – and this hugely influences her acting. “It is important not to be too knowing and not to be afraid of the characters you are playing.” As Strout’s Lucy Barton reflects: “I learned that work gets done if you simply do it.” She has never played anyone for whom she had no sympathy.Linney’s first marriage was to the actor David Adkins and lasted five years. Her second husband, Marc Schauer, is a real estate agent – they met at the Telluride film festival in 2004 where he was a VIP host. I wonder how much real estate – her surroundings – matter to her? “Very much so but I must be careful about telling you where I live because of crazy stalker people who show up.” It is only subsequently, from a story in the New York Times, that I discover she is not being fanciful. Linney was stalked for several years, bombarded with unwanted bouquets at every turn. The situation became\u0026nbspso extreme she had to involve the police to put a stop to it.But now she is conjuring the necessary props of her life: “Books – too many. I have a book problem. Art. A really good bathtub. I like to soak in hot water. I like light when it is there. I don’t want to live in darkness. I like texture. But the things I love do not always go together.” She laughs. “And then you have a child and everything is turned upside down and you are stepping on Lego. My husband keeps saying: ‘A dog is coming.’ And I keep saying: ‘Not yet, please!’”It would be easy to get away with a sense of Laura Linney as all sweetness and light – but she is, I think, complicatedly earthed. When I ask what her greatest fault is, she says: “I’m very self-critical. I’m better with other people than I am with myself.” She adds: “I always feel my work could be better.” A show that particularly exposes the mix of light and dark is The Big C, the TV series in which she stars as a woman living in suburban Minneapolis with terminal cancer, putting a pretty face on calamity and deciding against treatment in favour of living (she even offers us a cartwheel or two). The Big C stood for comedy as well as for cancer and won Linney an Emmy in 2013.“My father died of cancer while we were making The Big C. For me, it confirmed that absurd things happen where the only thing you can do is laugh. My father had to go from one test to another and came out of one procedure not at all lucid. He was speaking in this Appalachian accent and pretending to box somebody. We had to travel miles with him through the hospital, through elevators and down hallways – and it was just insane. And there was a Christmas party going on with Santa Claus saying ‘Ho! Ho! Ho!’” Comedy, she now asserts, is “a survival technique. It comes to you when life is chaotic and has a way of going right to the truth. There is such relief in the recognition of the truth that you laugh.”She is one of the least self-pitying people I have ever met, most of all on the subject of age: “Ageing is a tremendous privilege. I lose my patience with people who complain about getting old… it’s a slap in the face to everyone who has not had the privilege of ageing. I find it incredibly disrespectful. I get really upset.” I ask if she is thinking of people like Natasha Richardson with whom she was friends. “Yes – and of anyone who died of Aids early, anyone who has been in a tragic accident, anyone whose life was cut short.”Yet she is not saying that getting older is a breeze: “We’re human. Ageing is not easy. There are times when I don’t know why my body isn’t working and don’t like what I see. All of a sudden, you don’t recognise yourself in the mirror or it is hard to get out of a chair.” I say it is difficult to believe that it is ever hard for her to get out of a chair. “It can be! And all of a sudden, you don’t remember with the clarity and alacrity you used to… but what matters is that this is where you are.”What would she say her inner age was? She hesitates: “I have twins.” I tell her that sounds like cheating. She persists: “I have an older and younger person dancing together in me.” Does she fear becoming older still? “No, I find it a relief. And there is something about the responsibility of getting older, there are people coming behind us who need us to get out of the way. And honestly – I’ve had my time, thank you.”Only she hasn’t, as My Name Is Lucy Barton is sure to prove. On the way out, I greet Richard Eyre and Elizabeth Strout, waiting for her like workers in an engine room – Strout looks up at Laura: “You look lovely.” And I leave them to it – it is only a matter of days now before Linney’s Lucy Barton introduces herself to\u0026nbspLondon.My Name Is Lucy Barton starts previewing at the Bridge theatre, London SE1, on 2 June and runs until 23 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233f1ec684e15247b26a82bcf183d0443069fa60/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188d236bbeb75e48c918d5a2562747a1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Wild horses, an Ethiopian wolf and a dolphin attacking a porpoise are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a40c9414521a97a107a31c4510ae568b3a14e743/6_1216_3728_2235/master/3728.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a87bf6818fffef1eae0bf365cb743e2","title":"anthony hopkins most nonsense most lie lear","story":"Alcoholism and ambition fuelled the actor’s rise to the top. He talks masculinity, fame – and why he’s finally ready to play LearFor anyone who looks toward their later years with trepidation, Sir Anthony Hopkins (“Tony, please”) is a proper tonic. He is 79, and happier than he has ever been. This is due to a mixture of things: his relationship with his wife of 15 years, Stella, who has encouraged him to keep fit, and to branch out into painting and classical composition the calming of his inner fire, of which more later and his work.Hopkins loves to work. Much of his self-esteem and vigour comes from acting – “Oh, yes, work has kept me going. Work has given me my energy” – and he is in no way contemplating slowing down. You can feel a quicksilver energy about him, a restlessness. Every so often, I think he’s going to stop the interview and take flight, but actually he’s enjoying himself and keeps saying, “Ask me more! This is great!”We meet in Rome, where he is making a Netflix film about the relationship between the last pope (Benedict) and the current one (Francis). Hopkins is playing Benedict, Jonathan Pryce is Francis. He is enjoying this – “We’re filming in the Sistine Chapel tomorrow!” – and we are both relishing the lovely view across the city from the penthouse suite in the hotel where he’s staying. Still, he declares that the film we are here to talk about, the BBC’s King Lear, filmed in England and directed by Richard Eyre, is the piece of work that has made him truly happy. “I felt, ‘Yes, I can do this.’ I can do this sort of work. I didn’t walk away. And it’s so invigorating, because I know I can do it, and I’ve got my sense of humour, my humility, and nothing’s been destroyed.”He’s played the part before, at the National Theatre in 1986, with David Hare directing. “I was… ” – he counts in his head “… 48,” he says. “Ridiculous. I didn’t realise I was too young. I had no concept of how to do it. I was floundering.”Now, he feels he’s got Lear right, and few would disagree. In a star-studded cast – Emma Thompson plays Goneril Emily Watson, Regan Jim Broadbent, Gloucester Jim Carter, Kent Andrew Scott, Edgar – it’s Hopkins who dominates. He is fantastic: his white hair close-cropped, his manner like a heavy-headed bull, a scary tyrant losing his powers, a drinker who flips into terrifying rage.Hopkins’ theory is that Lear’s wife died giving birth to Cordelia, and Lear brought her up, his favourite, as a tomboy. Of the older two daughters, Emily Watson said, “and I agree with her, that they have become monsters, because he made them so”. Hopkins believes that Lear is terrified of women, can’t understand them. Hence the awful specificity of the curses he rains on his older daughters, damning their wombs. He seeks refuge in men, surrounding himself with a boisterous male army. The scenes where Lear wants to bring his retinue to Regan’s house are reminiscent of an awful, all-boys-together drink-fest.“I come from a generation where men were men,” Hopkins says. “There’s nothing soft or touchy-feely about any of us, where we were from in Wales. There’s a negative side to that, because we’re not very good at receiving love or giving it. We don’t understand it. After Richard Burton died, his brother Graham invited me to the Dorchester where they were all having a get-together, the wives and the men, all the sisters and brothers. All pissed. And I noticed the women were sipping their ports and brandy, but all the men were, ‘Come on, drink! Drink!’ I thought, ‘There’s something very Greek about this.’ Men together. You know, like the bouzouki dancers. It’s not homosexuality, but it is a sexuality, a kind of bonding. That’s what I was thinking of.”Hopkins often uses his past to find his way into a character. Small incidents that stick in his mind, real people who inform. In the scene with Kent, Edgar and the Fool, as Lear descends into madness, he has all three line up on a bench and addresses them with the wrong names. Hopkins decided that Lear had seen his father drown three puppies when he was young and believed his friends to be those dogs. “Cruelty to an animal stays with you for the rest of your life,” he says. “I once witnessed something like that, but I can’t think of it too much, it’s too upsetting. But that little kernel of an event doesn’t go. It grows with you.” When he portrays deliberately scary people – such as Hannibal Lecter or Robert Ford in the Westworld series – he plays them quietly, emphasising their sinister control. His Lear, though, is explosive. “He’s completely bonkers – he laughs at the storm. That’s what I like about him.”In the film, Hopkins uses a horseshoe as his crown. He asked a friend, Drew Dalton, a props guy on Westworld who is also an Idaho farmer, to get it for him, and he told him it was from an old horse, born in 1925. When Hopkins talks about this horse, he gets a little teary. “I carry the horseshoe with me wherever I go now. I still get emotional about it – the power, and the loneliness, and the pain of that horse. That’s Lear.”Tears come easily to him, especially when he talks about hard work, old age, masculinity. His father, Dick, was a baker, a tough, practical man, born of another baker. But, Hopkins says, as he got older, small things would upset him, “like if he made a mistake in his car and drove off a ramp instead of getting it just right, he’d break down crying. Towards the end of his life, he used to drink, and he was unpredictable. Never violent, but sudden turns of rage, and then deep depressions. Turned on my mother, turned on me. I was old enough, so it didn’t bother me. We didn’t speak much before he died. He resented me for something. I understood it, I could get it, and I thought, ‘What a terrible, lonely horror, for people at the end of their lives.’”It’s easy to see how he drew on this for Lear. Hopkins has a daughter, too, Abigail, from his first marriage, but they don’t have a relationship, so there was no inspiration there. “No. I accepted it years ago. It’s her choice and she must live her life. I say to young people, ‘If your parents are giving you trouble, move out.’ You’ve got to let go. You don’t have to kill your parents, but just leave if it’s holding you back.”Lear came out of another BBC film, an adaptation of Ronald Harwood’s The Dresser, also directed by Eyre and broadcast in 2015. Hopkins was the ageing, belligerent actor Sir, who is preparing to play Lear Ian McKellen was Norman, his dresser. Hopkins had wanted to do the play since picking up a copy in a bookshop in Los Angeles, where he lives: “It opened the valves of nostalgia.”When he first became involved in the theatre, in the late 1950s, Hopkins was a stage manager, touring northern towns, meeting “old, wrecked, alcoholic, wonderful” vaudeville comedians who’d worked during the war, talking to stage hands who knew the technique of dropping the curtain for comedy (fast) and tragedy (very slow). Then he joined the National in the time of Olivier and Gielgud. He was impatient for success. “Oh,” he says, “I had nonspeaking parts, messengers and God knows what, and I was very disgruntled, because I wanted to be bigger. So I went to the casting director and said, ‘Who do you have to sleep with to get a part around here?’ I’d only been there three weeks!”The casting director was taken aback, but mentioned him to Olivier, who gave him a part as an IRA man in Juno And The Paycock. Hopkins knows now that his hubris was ludicrous, but he was anxious to get to the action, and still is. “I think, with life, just get on with it, you know?” he says. “We’re all going to die, and that’s a great motivator.”He’s always called himself a loner – “alone, loner, solitary”, he says to me – and in past interviews his outsiderdom has become almost his headline characteristic. But he and McKellen bonded, regaling each other with old stories instead of rehearsing. Having felt, for all those years, unwanted by the establishment, the establishment was making him welcome. He also realised that he wanted to do Lear for real.Not on stage, though. Despite his nostalgia, Hopkins hates the theatre. In 1973, he walked out of Macbeth mid-run at the National and moved to LA. The last stage play he was in was M Butterfly, in the West End in 1989. It was a torment, he says, the tipping point being a matinee where nobody laughed, “not a titter”. When the lights came up, the cast realised the entire audience was Japanese. “Oh God,” he recalls. “You’d go to your dressing room and someone would pop their head round the door and say, ‘Coffee? Tea?’ And I’d think, ‘An open razor, please.’”He can’t stand being unproductive, working without a point it drives him mad. David Hare once told Hopkins he’d never met anyone as angry: “And this was when I was off the booze!” He gave up drinking in 1975. For a while, he tried to quieten down his personality (“I was ever so careful”), but his mother told him it wasn’t working. “She said, ‘Why don’t you just be the bastard that you really are?’ She said, ‘I know what you’re like, you’re a monster.’ I said, ‘Yes.’ She said, ‘Well, OK then, be a monster.’“But the anger, you begin to channel it,” he says. “I’m very happy I’m an alcoholic – it’s a great gift, because wherever I go, the abyss follows me. It’s a volcanic anger you have, and it’s fuel. Rocket fuel. But of course it can rip you to pieces and kill you. So, gradually, over the years, I have learned not to be a people-pleaser. I don’t have a temper any more. I get impatient, but I try not to judge. I try to live and let live. I don’t get into arguments, I don’t offer opinions, and I think if you do that, then the anger finally begins to transform into drive.”Now, if he’s not acting, he paints, or plays the piano. He released an album of classical compositions, Composer, performed by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 2011, which was well-received. “Hopkins writes with considerable flair and confidence,” said one critic, while Amazon gives it four stars. He began painting at the behest of Stella, who saw how he decorates his scripts. He goes over his lines around 250 times, until he can recite them backwards, sideways, in his sleep. Every time he reads them, he draws a doodle on his script, and the doodles, which start as small crosses, grow enormously large, covering all the blank space. Stella saw this and got him to paint “favours”, little presents for their wedding guests.“She said, ‘Well, if they don’t work, no one’s going to put you in jail,’” he says. And nobody did, because his paintings are pretty fine they sell for thousands of dollars. He shows me some on his phone. They’re expressionist, full of bright colours – “South American colours: Stella is Colombian” – and he’s working towards a show next year in St Petersburg, which he’s very excited about.“Ask me more questions!” he says. He doesn’t want to waste time sitting around while the photographer sets up. We talk animals. He and Stella collect stray cats and dogs. We talk politics. He doesn’t care about Trump he doesn’t vote. He takes a widescreen approach to politics, because focusing on the detail makes him too unhappy. “I don’t vote because I don’t trust anyone. We’ve never got it right, human beings. We are all a mess, and we’re very early in our evolution. Look back throughout history: you have the 20th century, the murder of 100 million people, barely 80 years ago. The 1914-18 war, the civil war in America, slaughter, bloodshed… I don’t know if there’s a design in it, but it is extraordinary to look at it and get a perspective. I think, ‘Well, if it’s the end, there’s nothing we can do about it, and it’ll blow over, whatever happens.’”He remembers talking to his father on the phone during the Cuban missile crisis (“and I was a raving Marxist then”) and his father remarking that the bomb would be dropped on London, so Hopkins would be all right, “because the bomb will drop on you, so you won’t know much about it. But in Wales, we’ll suffer the fallout.” His dad also once said to him, about Hitler and the second world war, “Six years later, he was dead in a bunker. So much for the Third Reich”, which makes me laugh.Now he avoids news and politics, for his peace of mind. “In America, they’re obsessed with healthy food,” he says. “They tell you, if you eat junk food, you get fat and you die. Well, television is run by money and corporate power and sponsorship. It’s junk food for the brain. Toxic.” If he’s not busy, he orders books online and sends them to friends – Wake Up And Live! by Dorothea Brande, The Life-Changing Magic Of Not Giving A F**k by Sarah Knight – or watches old films and TV on his iPad. He was obsessed with Breaking Bad, and wrote a lovely letter to Bryan Cranston extolling his acting now, he likes watching Midsomer Murders, The Persuaders and Rosemary \u0026amp Thyme.We talk a bit about the #MeToo movement. Hopkins says, about Harvey Weinstein, “I did know about the person you are referring to, about his sexual stuff. I know he is a rude man and a tyrant. But I avoided him, I didn’t want anything to do with people like that. Bullies.” And actually, despite his desire to live and let live, Hopkins often calls bullies out: when John Dexter, the director of M Butterfly, started shouting at everyone in the cast, Hopkins told him to stop. “I said, ‘John, you don’t need to do this. You’re a great director. Stop it.’ And he cried. I mean, I understand if people are bullies. They’ve got their problems. I can’t judge them, I won’t make fun of them at awards. It’s correct for women to stand up for themselves, because it’s unacceptable. But I don’t have a desire to dance on anyone’s grave.”He understands that we can all be terrible, and we can all be kind. Fame and power have nothing to do with it. I tell Hopkins something the singer Tony Bennett once said – “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough” – and he is delighted. “How extraordinary. What an amazing thing to say! You know, I meet young people, and they want to act and they want to be famous, and I tell them, when you get to the top of the tree, there’s nothing up there. Most of this is nonsense, most of this is a lie. Accept life as it is. Just be grateful to be alive.”He shows me a picture on his phone. It’s of him aged three, with his dad on a beach near Aberavon. His dad is grinning. Hopkins is a cherubic child, with golden curls, caught somewhere between laughing and crying. “I was upset because I’d dropped a cough sweet.” He keeps it because it reminds him of how far he’s come.“I think, ‘Good God, I should be in Port Talbot.’ Either dead, or working in my father’s bakery. For some inexplicable reason I’m here, and none of it makes sense. And I look at him and I say, ‘We did OK, kid.’”• King Lear is on BBC2 on Monday 28 May.Commenting on this piece?

So it is with a giddy sense of expectation that I await the arrival of this sequelprequel hybrid. “Last time we gave you the happy ending,” burbles the trailer: ‘This summer we’ll take you back to the beginning.’ Thus, we find Lily James as the young Meryl Streep in sunny ’79, trying on her new dungarees, and trying out three handsome suitors (Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan and Jeremy Irvine), who will grow up to become Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Pierce “Pick-a-note-any-note” Brosnan. Meanwhile, Amanda Seyfried calls upon her mum’s old chums for guidance through her own pregnancy in an idyllic island rerun of former events – “only this time we know who the father is!” It’s hard to imagine director Ol Parker improving on the bizarre brilliance of Phyllida Lloyd’s record-breaking original, but the prospect of Andy Garcia playing a character named (guess what?) Fernando has already got me in a tizzy. A few weeks ago, I walked past Benny and Björn in the foyer of a London screening room and was so starstruck that I had to sit down and gather myself. Their songbook has so far proved to be indestructible let’s see what this sequel throws at it. MKAmerican writer-director Ari Aster’s astonishing debut film premiered in the January snows of Sundance, but releasing it to audiences in June was probably an act of mercy: once you emerge from this nerve-destroying horror, you might just need a bit of balmy summer warmth (or at least some tepid English drizzle) to thaw your bones. Comparisons to The Exorcist, often thrown around too carelessly by critics, are earned this time. The story of a suburban family thrown into a nightmarish, haunted grief spiral after granny kicks the bucket, it reassembles familiar elements from possession thrillers and haunted-house hack jobs into something that feels genuinely, demonically inventive – the less you know going in, the better. The scares here are extreme, but not cheap: Aster riddles the story with psychic pain and complex family dynamics, and it’s galvanised by Toni Collette’s stunningly primal performance as the raddled mother at the centre of the chaos. It may just be the greatest work of the Australian actor’s career that it comes wrapped in the most artful and frankly terrifying horror film in aeons is one of the summer’s happiest surprises.GLDirector Brad Bird always maintained that he would only make a sequel to The Incredibles if he could come up with a story that was as good as or better than that of the original. And, after a 14-year gap, we are about to discover what tempted him back to family life with Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and the kids. This much is known: the sequel sees Bob, AKA Mr Incredible, adjust to one of biggest challenges of his super-career – that of stay-at-home dad to Violet, Dash and the uniquely gifted super-baby Jack-Jack. Fans of the original will be hoping for more nefarious villainy, a planet in peril and a reprise of the gorgeous retro-futurist aesthetic that made The Incredibles the best looking of all the Pixar movies.WIThe second feature from Desiree Akhavan, the director of 2014’s bisexual indie drama Appropriate Behaviour is as witty and sexy as its predecessor, but goes to a darker and more introspective place. Chloë Grace Moretz plays the titular Cameron, a lesbian teenager who has been sent to a Christian gay conversion camp (much like in Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader) where young people are psychoanalysed and brainwashed into being straight. SSA (“same sex attraction”) is treated as a disease, making it a potent examination of internalised homophobia and more general teenage self-hatred, though the film is buoyed by joyously good-bad early 90s fashion and music, and American Honey’s Sasha Lane as “Jane Fonda”, a teen marijuana farmer with a prosthetic leg.SHSeeing charismatic non-professionals on screen has long been a part of cinema’s daily bread – at least since Luchino Visconti gave centre stage to a Sicilian fishing community in 1948’s La Terra Trema. But every now and then, this working method gets a fresh boost – as it does in Jonas Carpignano’s A Ciambra, in which Italian neo-realism lives again, with an executive-producer helping hand from Martin Scorsese. Carpignano previously paid a visit to the port community of Gioia Tauro in south-western Italy in his 2015 refugee crisis drama Mediterranea. Here he returns to some of the same characters – members of the real-life Roma family the Amatos, notably 14-year-old Pio, in a coming-of-age story about breaking away from the dominion of the reigning local hoods to start a criminal career of his own. This Calabrian-dialect drama crackles with unruly energy and sense of place, and Pio Amato is one of those screen naturals that come along only every few now and thens.JR“A rescue op to save the dinosaurs from an island that’s about to explode – what could go wrong?” In 2015, Jurassic World served up an eye-poppingly empty spectacle in which the digitally rendered 3D beasties seemed altogether more lifelike than their two-dimensional human counterparts. So why get excited about this fifth Jurassic instalment? Largely because it’s directed by Spanish maestro JA Bayona, whose CV ranges from the spine-tingling chills of The Orphanage to the sublime fantasia of A Monster Calls via the real-life tragedies of The Impossible. How much of his personal stamp Bayona will be able to imprint on this corporate behemoth remains to be seen the trailer looks very smashy-crashy. But Jeff Goldblum is back (hooray!) pontificating about natural order, and the supporting cast includes an ever so slightly sinister-looking Toby Jones (hooray again!) banging a gavel. Fingers crossed. MKSimple but sharp, and emotionally intense, this British debut by Daniel Kokotajlo offers rare insight into an enclosed and little understood community – the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Set in Manchester, it’s a story of a mother (Siobhan Finneran) and her two daughters, Alex and Luisa (Molly Wright, Sasha Parkinson), raised according to the faith’s rigorous code. But Luisa, discovering other possibilities in life, finds herself “disfellowshipped” – barred from the community and contact with her family. The brilliance of Apostasy is testimony to the fact that storytelling sometimes works best when film-makers are prepared to follow the unexpected path, at the risk of throwing their audience. Kokotajlo’s own background as a Witness brings a meticulously observed authenticity, and superb performances open up deep personal dimensions in this trenchant inquiry into the cost of fundamentalist fervour. JRWorking-class and slightly goofy-looking, Lee Alexander McQueen was, on paper, unlikely to even break into the hallowed world of high fashion, let alone become one of its brightest stars. But as this thrilling, troubling documentary demonstrates, McQueen had the kind of white-hot talent that is impossible to ignore. However, the problem with anything white hot is that it tends to burn out quickly, leaving plenty of wounded people in its wake. The (savage) beauty of this documentary by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui is that it goes beyond the admittedly fascinating life story of British fashion’s enfant terrible. The film attempts to capture the grand guignol theatricality of McQueen’s designs and – in particular – the often controversial shows.Bonhôte and Ettedgui embellish the narrative with skulls and shadows, imagery from a baroque nightmare or a glimpse into the psyche of the designer himself. It goes without saying that this will be on the must-see list for anyone remotely interested in fashion. But McQueen was more than just a frock designer: he was both a cultural icon and an iconoclast an avant garde artist and an East End geezer who camped up his cockney accent. The appeal of this vivid portrait will be similarly far-reaching. WIIt has been so long since Hollywood released a proper studio romantic comedy. Not failed feminist thinkpieces like I Feel Pretty watered-down imitations of the genre à la Home Again or chemistry vacuums like the Fifty Shades franchise but a fun, glossy, big-budget movie with a capital M. Which is why I’m so excited about Warner Brothers’ Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s 2013 bestselling novel.The plot is a classic culture clash: born and bred New Yorker Rachel Chu (Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu) attends an ornate wedding in Singapore with boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding), only to discover that his relatives are crazy rich (and judging by the trailer, pretty bonkers also). Petty drama, a disapproving mother-in-law, a bawdy best friend, sex, romance and a sweeping pop soundtrack? Yes please. Even better, it’s a majority Asian cast (you’d hope so, considering the title, but with Asian characters recently rewritten for Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton in Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange respectively, it’s not a given), and the first contemporary film of its kind from a Hollywood studio since 1993’s The Joy Luck Club. SHEver since I was a child, I have been a sucker for a shark movie. Whether it’s a classy, fine-whittled tension exercise like Jaws or The Shallows or an all-out trash attack like the Sharknado series, any combination of watery peril, bad movie science and big gnashing chompers is delirious comfort viewing to me.So this thrillingly stupid-looking thriller – locking the redoubtable Jason Statham in combat with a 75-foot megalodon surging from the depths of extinction – has been an easy choice for my most anticipated title of the summer ever since the gaudy, perfectly absurd trailer hit the internet a few months back. Hopes are high that this could prove the new century’s Deep Blue Sea, and if you understand why that’s an exciting prospect, then you are one of my people.

At the Liverpool end, they were stunned, and they were not alone. The goal that won the European Cup had to be watched twice and they still couldn’t believe it even the replay on the giant screen didn’t entirely shake them out of it. For the second time, the second Real Madrid goal, they were left wondering whether that had really happened. The first goal was surreal, perhaps the stupidest the European Cup final has seen the second was sublime, perhaps even the most brilliant. Gareth Bale had been on the pitch for only two minutes when he took flight. High in the Kiev sky, he connected with a wonderful overhead kick.Bale ran to the corner and threw himself to the turf, sliding face down. Cristiano Ronaldo followed his team-mates over to the Welshman. On the far touchline Zinedine Zidane could barely believe it. He scored the winning goal in the European Cup final at Hampden Park 16 years ago, a volley that became emblematic. When Ronaldo scored an overhead kick in Turin in the quarter-final this year, Juventus’s fans had stood to applaud. Afterwards, Zidane had been asked about it. “Mine was nicer,” he smiled, a twinkle in his eye. Even he may admit that Bale’s was better, just as even Karim Benzema may admit that his goal was the worst he has scored in his career.Between them, Bale and Benzema, assisted by Sergio Ramos and Loris Karius, had taken Madrid to a third title in a row, history made. For Bale, it is his fourth title since moving to Spain. It may yet be his last. Asked afterwards about a move to the Premier League he said: “I need to be playing week-in, week-out and that hasn’t happened this season for one reason or another ... I have to sit down in the summer and discuss my future with my agent and take it from there.”If this was his final game for Madrid, it was some way to bid farewell. Or perhaps it can be a new beginning, a revival. It was, after all, a moment beyond the reach of the plausible, like something out of a comic. An astonishing goal to which he later added with a long shot that slipped through the hands of the Liverpool goalkeeper, who was inconsolable at the end. Karius curled himself into a ball, face hidden in his shirt Bale stood, arms aloft. The European Cup final was won and by a moment worthy of any final. Madrid had not always impressed, but the goal certainly did. Until then, and speaking of comic, the final had been marked by two moments. Karius throwing the ball against Benzema’s boot and into the net and before that, Ramos dragging Mohamed Salah to the ground, forcing him out of this final, and seeming to change the game entirely – even if Liverpool did find an equaliser, thus requiring Zidane to call on Bale. So, on he came, to score the decisive second and a third that made it safe. Left out to start with, he was named man of the match. Scorer in Lisbon, successful in the shootout in Milan, he had done it again in the Ukraine. Twice.Bale’s absence from the starting XI was not out of keeping with his season: it had started on Valentine’s Day, when he was left out against Paris Saint-Germain, an unexpected decision which was soon revealed as no one-off, not least because of the sense that he did too little to rebel when he came on, accused of disengaging. In the second leg he was again left on the bench. In Turin it was the same and, although he started the second leg, he was withdrawn at half-time, with the team 2-0 down. He withdrew at full-time too, while his team-mates celebrated.“I had to do something,” Zidane said afterwards. But, Bale wondered, did it have to be that? There had been no explanation, no conversation he and Zidane did not talk.Against Bayern Munich there was more of the same. Madrid had made it to the final but he had played only 99 of 540 minutes in the knockout phases. And yet, his performance in Villarreal last week, widely assumed to be a dress rehearsal, the gathering speed and the specifics of Liverpool, had brought him back into a focus, a candidate to be included from the start for the final. Instead, it was the same XI than began in Cardiff in last year’s final, Benzema beginning ahead of him then, Bale was injured, here there was no excuse. No consolation, either – that would come later, and how.When Madrid’s subs came out to warm up, the Welshman did not join them. That is not so abnormal, but as a staging of his separateness it is still striking. He too had become resigned to the probability of a departure. Bale, though, knew that there might always be a chance, that at least he could go the right way. Liverpool knew that Madrid could change the game from the bench in a way that they could not. A couple of months ago it had been suggested to him that for all that he had not been playing, for all that he had thought his time at Madrid was ending, and that much as he probably would not start in Kiev, he would come on and win the final. And so it proved. Even if he had believed it, he would not have imagined it like this. An overhead kick, a long shot that Karius dropped into the net, and a fourth European Cup. No Briton has ever won more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38358fdf7bafb2a64f88153127a163e4049147b7/761_117_1754_1053/master/1754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8e90caf6ce90c12fac246003da7a4a9","title":"liverpool mohamed salah cruel end real madrid sergio ramos champions league","story":"What did Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos intend when grabbing the Egyptian’s arm? He might say he was reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive approach. Either way Salah was doneAnd fade to white. By the end of a messy, thrilling, occasionally grisly Champions League final in Kiev the most unexpected note was that Liverpool’s fearless run to this stage should end with regrets and a quiver of what might have been.It seemed even crueller still that the final image of Mo Salah’s joyful season should be the sight of the Premier League player of the year leaving the pitch in tears with half an hour gone. But then there are reasons why Real Madrid win these games, why the same faces keep on being framed by the cameras year after year lifting that intoxicatingly shiny trophy. Or in other words: Mo, meet Sergio.Madrid were the story here: three-times champions, with victory capped by an overhead kick from Gareth Bale of such devastating grace that even the Liverpool end offered him a ripple of bruised applause as Madrid lined up for the restart.Yet there will be a sense through red-tinted spectacles of having been cheated by fate, by misfortune and by Sergio Ramos.Make no mistake Liverpool had their moments to take this game by the scruff, most obviously in the opening quarter when they went for the full, blitz attack, drawing stumbles and stutters and hoofed clearances as those princely white shirts looked a little giddy. Liverpool can do this to you, swarming in with the body shots, taking your breath, making the pitch spin. Something had to give. It did. The wrong thing.Nobody will ever really know what Ramos intended as he grabbed Mo Salah’s arm and tumbled to the ground. No foul was awarded, even with Salah lying in agony holding his shoulder. Probably this was simply an innocent coming-together. In slow motion it looked like an expert secret service judo move, the kind of thing you spend three years learning to pull off in a camp in the Swiss Alps, along with the blow dart to the neck and the sword-stick umbrella jab.Ramos might say he was giving some back in kind, reacting to Liverpool’s own concussive style. Either way Salah was done, soldiering on for a few moments before going down in distress clutching a dislocated shoulder. Ramos, svengali of white-shirted bastardism, loves these games. Here he seized another by the throat and squeezed at the vital moment.Instantly the weather inside the stadium changed. The excellent Sadio Mané was switched from the left where he had been traumatising Dani Carvajal. The red shirts seemed winded – and within six minutes of half-time Madrid were in front, Loris Karius producing a gut-wrenching error, placing the ball on the end of Karim Benzema’s foot in front of an open goal from a simple throw-out.Liverpool did not let it drop. Four minutes later they were level, Mané nipping in at a corner to poke the ball past Keylor Navas, drawing a vast cheer at that end and another note in the pure pleasure that has soundtracked this run to Kiev and which will remain even now the dominant note of a lost May weekend in Ukraine.What is black and white and red all over? Kiev of course. Or at least it was for one sun-drenched afternoon as Liverpool’s travelling support added a great sweaty replica-shirted smear of red to the washed out greens and blues and greys.They came in vans and coaches and cars. They came via Frankfurt and Amsterdam. Throughout the day they packed Shevchenko park with a bobbing, burping, chanting mass of sun-flushed flesh and filled the side-street bars with a travel-frazzled sense of Soviet-tinged dolce vita.As the minutes ticked down to kick-off there was a familiar feeling of ravenousness and an impatience around the pre-match hoopla, capped by the massed kitchen foil-clad dancers of the great Dua Lipa, who eventually appeared bouncing gamely on top of a blue and yellow birthday cake stage.Even with Salah off, this game was still there. Mané hit the post. Trent Alexander-Arnold struggled manfully with Marcelo, sniping inside like a horribly malevolent giant tarantula. But without that glaze of genius, the switch of gear that Salah brings, Madrid were able to purr forward.Still it took another painful howler from Karius to kill the game as he let a Bale shot spill through the most brittle of pasta-wristed punches. This was a professional tragedy for a footballer in the biggest match of his life, on a stage to which he will surely never return.But it was also not entirely surprising. Jürgen Klopp persuaded Karius to sign for Liverpool in the first place, then made him his number one. At the end of which, and when it really matters, Karius has made a pair of match-killing howlers. Meanwhile, in the suburbs of Kiev and beyond, the sun continues to rise, dogs still bite postmen, brown bears still seek out the treeline when nature calls. A new goalkeeper looked like an essential summer signing even before tonight.The intersection of luck and design is always a difficult area in sport. Here Liverpool could only bring on a half-fit Adam Lallana for Salah. Madrid could call on Bale, Salah’s equivalent as a player but able to lurk potently on the bench.Liverpool will leave Kiev a little bruised but also with a sense that their one real shot at this game, that full-throttle Plan A, was derailed in the coldest fashion by a more seasoned, powerfully stocked team of champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa7266bdbe691045685bdcdbb474384c9e1cc107/0_98_5055_3033/master/5055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebdd0e8b74888055fef19459c7d5cc16","title":"real madrid truly great champions league liverpool","story":"“We are Real Madrid,” Marcelo said boldly after Real Madrid had – just – held off Juventus’s fightback in the quarter-final. The reference was clear: they were not Barcelona, not the sort of team to go giving away three-goals leads as their great rivals had the previous night, not the sort of side who countenanced failure. Whether that is arrogance or a necessary mindset for winning probably depends on perspective, but what is true of that Madrid is that their most obvious quality is simply that they win. Inexplicably at times, but remorselessly.Madrid are only the fourth side in history to have been European champions three times in a row. Only they themselves, between 1956 and 1960, have had a run of sustained success better than the four Champions Leagues they have won in the past five years. That suggests they are one of the greatest teams in history and yet it really doesn’t feel like it.Perhaps the issue is one of proximity, that being so close means their flaws stand out and time will provide the perspective that allows their achievements properly to be measured. And yet there was no such issue with Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona, whose 2011 triumph confirmed the greatness they had touched in 2009 and come so close to repeating in 2010.“In 10 years I don’t think anybody will speak about how we lost,” Jürgen Klopp said on Saturday night, and perhaps that is the real issue with perspective. There is an assumption that a club that keeps winning must be great and the precise details fade away. Saturday’s success, after all, was the result of a bizarre concatenation of freakish circumstance: a brilliant overhead kick, two hideous goalkeeping errors and an injury to the opposition’s best player.But what’s really bizarre is how frequently similar circumstances have occurred this season. Sven Ulreich’s mistake that ultimately settled the semi-final against Bayern seemed like an error for the ages. A game and a half later, it was battling to stay on the podium for worst mistake made against Real Madrid by a goalkeeper in the Champions League this season. Add in penalties given and not given, against Juve and Bayern, and it’s pretty clear that a lot of key moments have fallen Madrid’s way this season. Whether you think that is a matter of luck or of the winning mentality of which Marcelo spoke probably depends on who you support.The dissonance comes when Madrid’s Champions League record is compared to their record in the domestic league. In those last five seasons, they have won the domestic title only once. That makes little sense: how can a team that dominates in Europe not dominate at home?And yet none of those other sides who won three titles in a row also won their domestic league in each of those three seasons. Madrid’s five in-a-row champions of the late fifties won the league only twice in that spell. Ajax won only two between 1971 and 1973. Bayern won only one between 1974 and 1976 – and finished as low as 10th in the Bundesliga in 1975. Perhaps this is simply the smoothing effect of time: Bayern, certainly, could easily gave lost the 1975 final against Leeds and the 1976 final against St-Étienne.In a sense, of course, this is, anyway, not comparing like with like. The competition is very different now to when those previous three three-time champions. Then, limited to champions, it was harder to get into, but with only five rounds could be won with a couple of good performances. Now, for the superclubs, with access to the last 16 and often the last eight all but guaranteed, the issue is peaking at the right time and having the decisiveness to win those key games in the spring.And greatness, anyway, perhaps is about more than mere trophies. As Arrigo Sacchi has always been very keen to point out, what matters in football, what is remembered, is not necessarily what is done, but what is done well. The Ajax of 1971-73, the Inter of 1964-65, the Barcelona of 2009-11, Sacchi’s Milan of 1989-90 took the game in new directions. They innovated, created a new style. They stood for something (and while that may have included a cynicism akin to Sergio Ramos’s, it certainly did not involve two of their biggest stars using their post-match interviews to agitate for moves).It’s not clear what exactly Madrid stand for. No philosophy, certainly, beyond having the money to sign lots of very good players. But they have that vital ruthlessness and in Zinedine Zidane a coach who, for all the doubts about him, has a habit of making decisive substitutions. Does that make them great? Perhaps in one sense it does, and such matters are probably necessarily subjective. But beyond he highly efficient accumulation of silverware, it would be hard to argue this Madrid have changed the game. They are, though, indisputably Real Madrid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577619abec3d220cdad2bfcdd2936514c6ac18ae/0_0_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e4f91cf7799b594dba00f6e9b74a062","title":"jane fonda interview film book club im 80 i cant believe it racism cosmetic surgery","story":"Jane Fonda is as outspoken, mischievous and political as ever. She talks to Sophie Heawood about racism, cosmetic surgery and the joys of working again with Robert RedfordJane Fonda has ruined me. I never want to interview anyone under the age of 80 again. Specifically, I never want to interview anyone who isn’t 80, and who doesn’t phone me for a catch-up call from a limo in Cannes, in which they are being driven to the airport, having gone to a deeply glamorous film festival party the night before and now finding themselves, as Fonda puts it delicately, “slightly hungover”. Fonda isn’t even hugely interested in Cannes these days, not like back in the day “when people wore their own clothes and went there to talk about movies”.No, she’s hungover in the limo, but wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement about what she has recently learned of the mass incarceration of African-Americans in her country and how it isn’t enough for white women like her to be empathetic. They have to stand up and make this stop, because America is a country built on slavery and it isn’t over yet.It’s a continuation of the conversation that began a few days previously, when I met her backstage at the Ellen DeGeneres chat show in Los Angeles. Fonda was preparing to promote her new film, Book Club, in which she plays one of four women who have reached a certain age, read Fifty Shades of Grey in their book club, and decided to do something about their passions. The link between spicing up your sex life and committing to ending gross inequality might not be an obvious one, but she explains that Book Club is about female solidarity and women having each other’s backs, and so is much of her “feminist activism”. Even though, when she first got interested in politics, she had just starred in the 1968 erotic sci-fi film Barbarella “and I took a lot of heat on it from feminists. The new women’s movement was in its early stages and there was a lot of…” she adopts a comically stern voice: “‘How do you feel making a movie that exploits women, like Barbarella?’ You’d kind of want to say: ‘Well, honey, nobody forced me.’ But,” she concedes, “it wasn’t much fun to make it.”Fonda’s small, white, fluffy dog Tulear is perched beside her. She actually wanted to name the dog Barbarella, but her daughter Vanessa, whose father, Roger Vadim, directed the film, wasn’t keen.If Book Club is a sort of geriatric Sex and the City, then Fonda plays the Samantha character, a leopardskin-clad businesswoman who schedules sex and won’t commit. “Vivian is sassy, she doesn’t want any emotional entanglements, and that was kind of fun.” Fonda explains that back in the early 20th century, “before there were the Nielsen ratings or whatever, the censor, there were actresses such as Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae West playing dangerous women – the parts they played were like guys. Then puritanism crept in. But I think there are going to be more women-centric movies, like Book Club, now. A lot of these movies are doing well, and I don’t think this is a phase – I think this is it.”Jane Fonda was born in 1937, the daughter of the actor Henry Fonda, and while her life was socially privileged, her home life was agony, and her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, killed herself in a psychiatric hospital. (Fonda was 12 and only found out that her mother’s death was suicide from a movie magazine – nobody ever spoke to her about it.) Jane herself was also sexually abused and in her memoirs she writes movingly about the concept of disembodiment – how it took her until the age of 62 to fully inhabit her own body.Her marriage to Ted Turner had just ended, “and I was single again and I realised… I’m not scared,” she says of it now. “I was alone in the house, looking out through my own eyes and I could live inside my own skin. It was a revelation. It was something else.”How painful is it that it took so long to get herself back?“I feel very sad that so many girls are abused all over the world and that men don’t understand what it does to them. It’s not something that happens lightly, it can alter a person. And then you have to be very intentional about getting back into your own skin, but it can be done. It wasn’t so much that I felt sad about all the wasted time, because I wasn’t fully authentic, but on the other hand, why not instead just be proud of yourself that you got there and you didn’t stop trying?”She also links plastic surgery to sexual abuse and has said that when she sees the face “of a woman who has made herself into a mask, I always think to myself… I wonder, I wonder.” She had her own breast implants taken out and has also had several facelifts of which she says she is not proud.As for #MeToo, is it also painful to not have had such a movement 50 years ago? Fonda once again takes my negative and turns it into a positive.“I am very grateful to be alive through this,” she says softly. “I did not think I would live to see it. Yes. And I think that it’s going to continue, it’s not just a moment. I love the Time’s Up aspect of it. We’re working with women from all different places. I’m going to DC to lobby with domestic workers. The farm workers up in Bakersfield. It’s all of us together, having each other’s backs.”This is why she made the film 9 to 5 in 1980, which became one of Hollywood’s highest grossing comedies ever, despite its subject matter of the awful way men treated women in the workplace. Fonda wants to produce a new version of the film, with younger actors, who now find their work life even more precarious on zero-hours contracts. We discuss the state of the labour unions in the United States. “So all this is not so new for me. But it is for a lot of other actors, and that’s why it’s a very valuable thing to hear what other women in other industries have to put up with, women who are much more vulnerable than we are.”I have to say it: Jane Fonda looks stunning, immaculately coiffed and made up, and with the poise and elegance that has always been hers. It’s thanks to a lifetime of fitness regimes for which everyone remembers her videos, and also to the facelifts. But they, she says, were more about survival in her industry than about vanity. “They bought me an extra 10 years.” Like it or not, it does seem to be true. How many other 80-year-old women currently have a hit comedy series on Netflix (Grace and Frankie), as well as movies coming out, a documentary on their life about to hit HBO, and no signs of stopping any time soon?Of course this is all down to much more than surgery: it is the third act of a career that began more than half a century ago and has involved two Oscars for Best Actress (and a further five nominations) along the way. Curiously, it is the fitness videos that people in the UK remember her for the most. In the States, there are still people who boycott Jane Fonda’s films because of how deeply involved she got in protesting against the Vietnam war. Not that any of that stopped her.In Grace and Frankie, which is now approaching its fifth season, she and Lily Tomlin’s character become accidental, grumpy housemates after their husbands fall in love with each other. When I tell people I’m going to interview Jane Fonda, a surprisingly wide range of people tell me how much they love that show. “I know,” she says, her voice dropping to an absolute whisper. “We’re stunned. We did not expect that. We’re trying to figure it out!” she hisses.She loves working with her old friend Tomlin “because she’s a working-class gal who grew up in a fascinating family. People visit the set who were with her in elementary school. She is just so funny – and I’ve tried to learn that from her. But it just comes naturally to her.” Surely you’re funny, too, I say. “Oh no,” replies Fonda, “I don’t have a natural funny bone. I come from a long line of depressed people.” She laughs.Having been married several times and lived with various partners, and recently split up with her last boyfriend, the music producer Richard Perry (she describes him as “a younger man” – she also wrote a blog about him having Parkinson’s), Fonda now lives in a gated retirement enclave with her own house, but a shared community centre with a pool and tennis courts “where I always see one or two other residents who seem infinitely older than I am, but they probably aren’t. I never thought I would ever live there, but it’s great.”She does yoga and Pilates and has even made a whole new series of workout videos, “and their label is Prime Time, as they’re for older people. I can’t do the original workouts any more, because I’ll hurt myself,” she gestures to her hips, “as I have joint replacements.” In fact, she says her main form of exercise these days involves jumping into things “before I really know what I’m doing. It’s called a leap of faith and it’s my main form of exercise. It’s what keeps me young, too. That’s my new workout. When you take a leap of faith you don’t always land in the right place, but you sure do learn things. It’s good for the heart.”At the weekends, she leaves Los Angeles to go knocking on the door of Trump voters. “When you’re talking to them you can’t criticise Trump. You can’t criticise Fox News. All you can do is listen to what they care about and what they’re afraid of, and then maybe tell them something that they don’t know. Because we’re all in our bubbles, including me.” Do people recognise her? “I was in Bakersfield last Saturday and knocked on 30 doors. Only one person saw me coming and said: ‘Grace and Frankie!’ It was a kick! Nobody else knew who I was. I just say: ‘I’m Jane.’ They don’t need to know.”She has also been acting with Robert Redford again. I tell her that I recently watched Barefoot in the Park, the 1967 film where she and Redford are giddy newlyweds in New York, and then went to Netflix and watched Our Souls at Night, in which she and Redford reunited in 2017 to play widowed grandparents who get together to end their loneliness.I tell her it was a really beautiful night of cinema, to see these two actors come back together with their war wounds, their egos bruised, their hearts more honest in later life. To my surprise, Fonda’s eyes start to water. “Ohh,” she says softly. “It moves me that you say that.”She has said that she was always in love with him when they worked together, but they were always married to other people. He said recently that he had no idea she loved him. Do they keep in touch? Send texts? “Oh no. He doesn’t text, number one two, he’s a loner. So that’s that.” She says she won’t ever fall in love again. “I love men, I’m not done with men, but I’m done with marriage and dating.”Fonda is unimpressed by the romance in many modern films. “I’m not a big mouth opener on camera. Every time I see a love scene with young ones – they come at each other like this…” she mimes a big wide-open slobbering jaw, “…and I’m thinking, well where does the fun come in? Because the fun is the sensuality of lips. And then slowly moving beyond that. But not trying to swallow each other.” She giggles. “I would not want to go right into a tongue kiss, quite frankly.”And then Woody Harrelson walks past the dressing room. Fonda sends somebody to get him back. “I want to hug you!” she says, standing up to greet him. “I saw Three Billboards again last night because I had a house guest who hadn’t seen it. You’re so good Woody, God!” she says. “You’re so good, Jane!” says a glowing, goofy Harrelson. It’s like watching a peacock hug a panda.And then they both have to go off and be on the telly, and I am left with the sense of having just been visited by grace and greatness.Book Club is in cinemas from 1 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb986e5bfaca0a78bc839d761981b22f633fbe80/0_69_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bfcbfab0041613146fd6b0b26261a","title":"martin parr day at the chelsea flower show a photo essay","story":"Magnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyMagnum photographer Martin Parr captures his unique view of gardening fans at the annual extravaganzaby  Martin Parr and  Maev KennedyJust one woman at Chelsea, peering through a thicket of foxgloves with a wry smile on her face, has clocked the quiet man in the brown shirt, owner of the most famously satirical eye in British photography. Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da138a6edf63a6fa1b148fb0be1071e8b2d6c1ba/0_36_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfae75880a5794f136260fa984bfb10e","title":"gay hussar soho to shut soho labour lunches plots gossip","story":"The Gay Hussar is among the most celebrated restaurants in London but its fame rests not so much on the quality of its chilled wild-cherry soup and its goulash, but on its reputation as the beating heart of political gossip.The Hungarian restaurant in the centre of Soho has played host to generations of politicians, many drawn from the left, including Aneurin Bevan, Michael Foot, Tom Driberg, Ian Mikardo and Barbara Castle.

That led to 160 politicians and journalists banding together as the so-called Goulash Co-operative, requiring a minimum investment of £500, and offering to chip in to buy it.In the end, with no decent offer on the table, Corus agreed to keep the restaurant open, giving it a minor rebrand as GH Soho, although with the restaurant’s traditional interiors and old-school meaty menu left largely unchanged.The Goulash Co-operative is again attempting a rescue – galvanising its membership with a new fundraising drive to add to the £150,000 already raised, and launching a plan not only to save the restaurant but to create an improved venue that better reflects changing tastes and trends.“We believe now is the time to create a new Gay Hussar, and are in talks with possible partners who agree with us that this unique establishment must be saved,” said the Goulash Co-operative’s spokesman John Goodman. “It’s showing its age. We have lots of exciting plans to renovate it, including installing a dumb waiter and a downstairs toilet.”Since it opened in 1953 it has been a haunt and popular watering hole of politicians, writers and artists. Devoted regulars have included the Labour grandees Roy Hattersley and Michael Foot – who celebrated his 90th birthday there – and more recently Gordon Brown. Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams had a regular table on the first floor, where he would bellow out whispered titbits from his informants. Election victories have been celebrated there and sorrows and defeats drowned with copious amounts of bull’s blood.It was founded by Victor Sassie, son of a Swiss father and Welsh mother, who trained for the restaurant trade partly in Hungary and opened his own establishment, the Budapest, in London in 1939. During the second world war, he worked for British military intelligence, and for Robert Maxwell after it. Sassie, who died in 1999, sold the Gay Hussar to the Restaurant Partnership in 1988.Over more than six decades the traditional decor of the open-plan ground-floor restaurant and two crimson-hued private rooms – connected by a narrow staircase – has barely changed, with every space and surface stuffed with books, caricatures and pictures.Downstairs, the wall-to-wall framed Martin Rowson cartoons of the political elite’s great and not-so-good – officially “on loan” from the artist – have been expanded to include the new generation of MPs, even if many choose not to dine there. The ground-floor dining room accommodates up to 40 diners, while two private rooms upstairs (with 25 and 12 covers) give scope for more discreet exchanges behind closed doors, over the dark wood tables and behind thick velvet drapes.Mark Seddon, the journalist and former Tribune editor and a member of the Goulash Co-operative, said: “There’s a lot of love for the place and we have plenty of ideas for reviving it. We think it has potential for literary events. It’s all very exciting.”Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said: “The action of Corus Hotels is deplorable and must be resisted. Supporters of the Gay Hussar have already raised a large sum with big and small donations. Now we must do that again to give us a fighting chance of securing the future of a restaurant which is part of political history.”Wrobel is not planning a farewell party on 21 June. “We will go quietly with a dignified ending,” he said. “There is nothing to celebrate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44af25f1731831925bde054169be0dbb26a06089/0_41_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edc285b013afa9069495c0a3c79bdf53","title":"the pressure to have a second child eva wiseman","story":"There are far easier ways to screw up your kid than by making them an only childIf you are a woman in the world, instead of being sent a telegram from the Queen, upon turning 30 you receive 1,000 magazine articles about motherhood. Some will come directly, arriving on your phone at 4am in the masked form of links to feminist websites. Some will appear in your lap at the hairdressers, or hidden in an interview with a director whose film you keep meaning to see, or ripped carefully against a ruler and included in a birthday card from your mum. Some you will search out yourself, as if you are a woman creeping through a lonely house with a knife having heard glass break downstairs – better you catch this intruder, than it catches you.Depending on the decade in which you come of age, these stories will be focused on the importance of having children young, or old, or of freezing your eggs so you can think about it later, or of how to find the perfect mate, or of the liberating glee that comes with doing it alone. There will be an equal number, too, explaining the benefits of remaining childless, your fellow women in snazzy heels and shiny skin leaning in to tell you about the fulfilling life it is possible to lead without the weight of a kid round your neck and, indeed, the compelling political reasons why you should never procreate.But despite being different stories, they all have the same ending. They all suggest that having a child or not having a child is simply a matter of a woman’s decision. They force you to think about babies, even if your hormones aren’t interested. These stories poke at your intellect, your curiosity about life and its side-effects. And they all make you feel extremely weary. And anxious. And lonely, sometimes, and also, on bad nights, already 75 and regretful about the other life you could have led.Having waded through that swamp of commentary, and having emerged virtually unscathed, with (though I don’t like to boast) the best three-year-old in Britain, I was unprepared for the second chapter. While the pressure to have children is so well-documented, there are no warnings about the pressure to have a second. It sneaks in, like ants come summer. There are few glossy magazine articles about this – in fact, so ingrained is the importance of siblings in the swarming consciousness of our culture that, unlike the seemingly genuine questions about whether to procreate in the first place, the adjacent debate about having more than one focuses purely on whether the existing child will be ruined by their onlyness. The parents are no longer part of the conversation. And it’s a conversation that is much stickier, seeing as it is now seen to be less about what the family wants but about what the child needs.A mother’s decision not to do it again, for reasons ranging from the practical (they’d have to move house, they can’t afford maternity leave) to the emotional (she had postnatal depression, she found the weight of love painful, like a two-year hangover), is irrelevant when faced with the idea that it will screw up her kid. If you have a child, then you must have another. To choose to stop there, it seems, from the combination of frozen smiles and earthy anecdotes about the psychopathic only child they knew growing up, or the future sadness of this two-year-old having to organise your funeral without a sister, is to be not just selfish, but perverse. Mothers are ided, again, into good and bad.I remember quite confidently predicting that one of the great benefits of growing up later than our parents would be the inevitable camaraderie of my friends either having one child or none at all, yet living close enough to each other that it would feel like we were a big sprawling family, but without the daily fights about hairdryers. It didn’t happen. Instead, we either mirrored the journeys of our parents, slotting new families into the holes left behind, or blazed off into radical new futures far far away. The middle way, with one child and no marriage, seemed so much more sensible to 20-odd-year-old me – so much more portable, and affordable. So neat. And then I had a baby.Does it screw a kid up, to be an only child? The evidence is sparse and weighted oddly. For every thin study saying yes, there’s a companion one saying no. And if it does, then what? The answer can’t simply be to have more children. Even if the idea of choice was real and solid – rather than a melting Solero in our hand – to me the whole exercise stinks slightly. We bring ourselves up to believe that we are perfectible. That simply by eradicating sugar from our diet, or by altering the questions we ask of our partners, or upon cutting in a choppy bob, all fear and anxiety will float away. Similarly, we’re encouraged to follow marked paths in order to create this version of symmetrical perfection, in the sunken belief that there is one correct way for a family to look. I’m not worried that being an only child will screw our daughter up. I have every confidence we’ll manage that anyway, whatever shape our family takes.In a speech last week, Sophie Walker (the leader of the Women’s Equality party) pointed out a problem with many businesses half-hearted movements towards equal representation. ‘Women don’t need mentors to get ahead. Get mentors for the men who don’t think there is a problem.’I’m writing under the threat of rain and it occurs to me the perfect name for the next spate of severe weather. I’d welcome Storm Daniels any day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c058069d0d7c98034c8376341aad29034eacfeb8/0_0_3152_1891/master/3152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f0e5cbc0cc76a3871e368e54dd18462","title":"what elon musk and george soros can teach us about media credibility","story":"Tesla founder hits out at journalists as anti-Brexit billionaire is accused by Daily Mail of undermining democracyThis is the tale of two billionaires at the heart of the current debate over truth and trust in the media: one, George Soros, long used to being vilified by the press the other, Elon Musk, who last week turned on journalists and called them liars.After a few negative headlines about his electric car company, Tesla, Musk took exception to an investigation by Reveal, website for the Center for Investigative Reporting, into the number of unreported injuries. Linking to a report disclaiming the negative headlines, the PayPal founder and space explorer tweeted: “Holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them.”He suggested that Tesla was criticised because it didn’t advertise, while Reveal’s supporters pointed out that the centre is not-for-profit and relies on donations, not ads.Perhaps, more tellingly for someone schooled on Silicon Valley’s obsession with data and doubts over journalism, Musk mooted a “media credibility rating site” where users can “rate the core truth of any article \u0026amp track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor \u0026amp publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …”While this could have been just a joke using the Russian word for “truth”, a company called Pravda Corp, linked to Jared Birchall, a director who works for Musk, was registered last October.When Musk asked his 22 million followers to vote for such a site, or the statement “the media is awesome”, more than 500,000 did so within 24 hours, the vast majority in favour of rating “core truth”, whatever that means.What use would there be for submitting British journalism to the thumbs up or down model of the gladiatorial web? For we know that polls, such as that produced by communications experts Edelman, point to a level of trust in the press and journalists that gets lower and lower every year.How, for example, would these voters rank the credibility of last week’s Daily Mail front page which accused billionaire Soros of funding a “plot to subvert Brexit”? No one can deny the existence of a 26-page report detailing a six-month PR plan ahead of a key parliamentary debate in October. Nor that Soros, a survivor of Nazi-occupied Hungary, has used more than $18bn (£13,5bn) of his fortune to fund many projects, including those he considers pro-democratic.But the issue is one of perception. The Mail accused Soros of being an “unaccountable nabob” who is “undermining democracy” by supporting a campaign “putting up billboards around the country calling for a second vote”.Such campaigns are typically considered part of a democratic process. Even Mail Online, in one of its occasional bursts of independence from its print sibling, took a step back by adding the words “claimed” and “apparently”.Soros, aka the man who broke the Bank of England, is no stranger to journalistic brickbats, of course. Called the “bugaboo of European nationalists” by the Economist, his support for various causes has led to accusations that he is engineering the migration of millions of Muslims to Europe. One Hungarian politician posted a picture on Facebook of a burnt carcass of a pig with the words “This was Soros” carved into its skin.And the Mail, of course, was exercising its democratic right by proclaiming its “belief that it is simply wrong for a foreign billionaire to exert his muscle” funding a campaign group in the UK. Leave to one side, for now, the non-domiciled status of its owner Lord Rothermere, the right to free speech in a democracy does, indeed, apply to everybody.Earlier this year, Soros told fellow plutocrats and politicians in Davos that it took a “real effort to assert and defend what John Stuart Mill called ‘the freedom of mind’”. He called Facebook and Google – the digital giants sucking advertising from all media including the Daily Mail and Reveal – a “menace to society”. For all the criticism, Soros does seem to have some appreciation of how a free media works.By contrast, Musk’s attitude towards journalists seems typical of a breed of titan in Silicon Valley. In their brave new world, poor reviews or any adverse view are just “fake news” and companies which make no money are not to be trusted.One hoped for better, not least because Musk’s made his first mega-millions with web software company Zip2, which allowed media companies to establish web presences with features such as maps and directions.In 2003 after selling his stake in PayPal, Musk said of his investments in web companies: “I like to be involved in things that change the world.” But he didn’t say anything about changing it for the better.For some change is disastrous. It is an outrage, for example, that Asda and Morrisons are refusing to stock the New European on the grounds of its anti-Brexit stance. Launched in nine days after the EU referendum, the weekly campaigning paper – with an average circulation of 22,000 – has won several awards since launching in June 2016. The editorial and management has made no secret of its pro-Remain stance. Indeed, its raison d’etre has been to redress the imbalance in the national media. Newspapers supporting Brexit are read by four times as many as those supporting the status quo. So why, if both supermarkets sell pro-Brexit papers, have they told the New European’s distribution team their “stores do not want to be seen to take a political stance”?All a matter of scaleNetflix, a streaming service about to turn 21, has been briefly valued at more than any other media company in the world. More than the vast Walt Disney or cable giant Comcast. It has been, in many ways, astute. A deal with the Obamas helped double its share in a year. For their part, the two older companies have been punished by shareholders concerned about their futures as well as their desire to merge with Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox and UK satellite company Sky. The rise of Netflix throws the Murdoch rationale to combine with something even bigger, into sharp relief.Digital competition prompted consolidation and led to the closure of many hundreds of regional papers. Now economies of scale are changing the face of far bigger groups and shifting tectonic plates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e34d9f9a7d08e8f255f0807057d78092b3b81e06/5_423_917_550/master/917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cba29bf84fc11f4d5376e2b247b74b0c","title":"fca urged to extend cap on payday loan fees to other forms of credit","story":"Debt charities and MPs want action when City watchdog’s 18-month review is publishedThe City watchdog is facing mounting pressure to extend its cap on payday lending fees and interest to a broader range of high-cost financial products before a major review of lending practices this week. Debt charities and politicians are urging the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to take decisive action on Thursday when it publishes the findings of an 18-month review into bank overdrafts, doorstep loans, catalogue credit and rent-to-own borrowing.Likely to result in a series of new rules for banks and finance companies, the review comes as hard-pressed Britons increase their personal borrowing to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has begun campaigning against high-cost credit providers, while spiralling levels of debt have stoked fears at the Bank of England over the return of reckless lending.The head of the FCA, Andrew Bailey, has previously said a cap similar to that used on payday loans was “on the table” as part of the high-cost credit review. However, debt charities fear the regulator will stop short of using the tool, which would protect consumers from paying back more in fees and interest than the amount borrowed.Damon Gibbons, the director of the Centre for Responsible Credit and who worked with Sheen on the actor’s campaign, said the FCA had a golden opportunity to “grasp the nettle” of high-cost credit. “If they don’t tackle the injustice of levying the highest charges on the poorest borrowers, then parliament will surely have to intervene again and force the FCA to use its powers properly,” he said.The Labour MP Stella Creasy, credited with forcing the Treasury to introduce the controls on payday firms such as Wonga and the Money Shop four years ago, said the finance industry had “mutated” to sidestep the cap.“They’re mutating into different forms of high-cost credit but the consequences are still the same. Even when consumers do the right thing, they’re still getting stung by these companies,” she said. Rachel Reeves, Labour chair of the business select committee, said: “It is unacceptable that doorstep lenders and providers of rent-to-own goods are allowed to blatantly exploit people they know are vulnerable. By charging exorbitant interest rates and fees, they are only worsening people’s financial woes. The FCA needs to take urgent action to stop unscrupulous providers creating more misery.”Gillian Guy, the chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: “People who use rent-to-own and doorstep loans are woefully unprotected from runaway costs.“Our research shows a cap on these loans would save people £185m and help stop debts spiralling out of control. The payday loan cap has been a remarkable success and led to a dramatic reduction in the number of people we see with problem debts from these loans.”The debt charity StepChange estimates as many as 1.4 million people last year used high-cost credit to cover essential living costs. Adam Butler, the senior public policy advocate at the charity, said: “We urge the FCA to take emphatic, decisive action to reduce the harm caused by high-cost credit.”The demands for action come as Citizens Advice estimates as much as £123m would be saved by consumers if the cap was extended to doorstep loans, while a further £62m of savings would go to borrowers using rent-to-own products.Last week, 84 MPs and the consumer group Which? called on the FCA to take urgent action to restrict unarranged overdraft charges, having found high street banks are able to charge seven times more than payday loan companies.A spokesman for the FCA said: “The FCA does not comment on speculation. The full document will be published on 31 May.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ff843f01e3d565b8aa082aaefdb4b37b2039a7e/0_91_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd07314ff7150aece3866e1103c55074","title":"electronic dance music edm has it all gone pete tong sales plateau","story":"Well, the party had to end sometime. The phenomenal rise of electronic dance music (EDM) may have entered a new, more mature phase, according to DJs and industry experts.An annual state-of-the industry report presented at the International Music Summit (IMS) in Ibiza last week, which examined everything from recorded music sales to DJ earnings, club and festival revenues and merchandising, suggests the industry is in rude health in Asia but is losing market share in the US and Europe.Kevin Watson, founder of Danceonomics, a knowledge hub for the electronic music industry, and the author of the report, said that, given such success, it was not surprising that appetite for the genre would eventually stall. “I think there’s still plenty of room for growth going forward. There’s been a slight dip but that’s to be expected, and the numbers still remain very positive on what the future looks like.”The rise of EDM has been powered by technology, with social media helping build the profiles of emerging artists such as the Belgian techno DJ Amelie Lens. It has also transformed the music distribution model.“Kids in their bedrooms can – pretty much for free – produce their own electronic music track and distribute it instantly,” Watson said. “And there’s lots of people out there that are now doing this and becoming very successful, because there are now almost zero investment costs.”Watson’s report will be seen in some quarters as confirmation that the long-predicted bursting of the EDM bubble has finally happened.But those within the industry suggest the picture is more nuanced. Pete Tong, the DJ and co-founder of the International Music Summit, told Music Week that the bubble had “punctured” rather than burst.“I guess another analogy would be: ‘The party’s over, it’s now time to really get your hands dirty, get back to work and look after this business you’ve built for this level and get it to the next phase’,” Tong said.Watson agreed, noting that as electronic music (he eschews the EDM label, arguing it has become synonymous with the commercial side of the genre) has teamed up with mainstream artists and festivals, its impact has become disguised. “You see a lot of tracks that are produced with DJs collaborating with other artists and a lot of those are being classified as pop or R\u0026ampB,” he said. “They’re not getting registered in electronic music’s share of sales. Another thing we’re seeing is a lot of mainstream festivals like Coachella, which we wouldn’t normally term electronic music festivals, are booking a lot of electronic music DJs and artists.”Recent examples of mainstream acts teaming up with EDM artists include Coldplay and the Chainsmokers, Justin Bieber’s work with Skrillex and Diplo and Ariana Grande’s collaboration with the DJ and producer Zedd.Conversely, as other music genres assimilate it, parts of the electronic music movement have gone more underground.“Quite often when things become much more populist and commercial, a lot of people become more focused on the underground, and that experiences a renaissance as well,” Watson said. “People might read about Coldplay and the Chainsmokers and the latest smash hit, but actually there’s a lot of stuff going on across the industry and there’s plenty of room for everyone to champion their particular sound.”Tom Faber, a DJ and music critic, predicts that the genre, whose roots lie in 1970s artists such as Kraftwerk and King Tubby, will continue to mutate. “Electronic music has been a thing over the last 40 years: it’s always going in and out of the mainstream. It’s one of the genres that’s always coming back. For me, electronic music is always looking forward, always doing something new.”For EDM’s superstar DJs, the industry continues to be a cash cow. Forbes estimates that Calvin Harris earned £37m last year while Tiesto took home £29m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8623d6d6a6ffb80fdd2ba03e33eb7d7486c8b63e/863_1124_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c6a97a73b0d0674afb2dc0f2d68c724","title":"chris froome set for giro ditalia glory tom dumoulin","story":"• Team Sky rider adds to his lead on penultimate stage• Victory in Rome would give him all three Grand ToursShortly after Chris Froome conquered the final summit of this year’s Giro d’Italia, and the realisation sunk in that he would be the first Briton to win the maglia rosa, he described the race as the “battle of his career”. Yet strangely after three weeks of vicious riding, the last significant skirmish on the way to Cervinia saw barely a blow attempted – at least on the road.Off it, however, it was a different story. For while Froome was cheered on by the majority of the huge crowd, he was also reminded that not everyone believes in him as one spectator rushed out and spat at him three kilometres from the finish. Afterwards Froome said that he had not seen the incident. But his team-mate Wout Poels certainly did, looking around in understandable horror.Froome also faced more questions about his stunning solo victory on Friday – with one reporter asking whether, unlike other great performances in the past such as Floyd Landis at the 2006 Tour de France, it would stand the test of time.“I can understand the parallels and comparisons being drawn by some people,” he replied.“But I have every confidence it will stand.” He also said that, contrary to some reports, his race data from Friday’s stage – where he reckoned he rode an average of 350 watts for three hours – was available to race organisers.“I’d be very surprised if the data isn’t there,” he added. “I have been riding around with an extra 100 metregram receiver of theirs the last three weeks. I’d be disappointed if they don’t have the data.”Froome also pledged, yet again, that he would be cleared of any wrongdoing after being found with double the permitted levels of salbutamol in his system at the Vuelta last September – as first revealed by the . “I have a clear conscience,” he said. “When the time is right, all the information will be shared with everyone and I am sure people will see it from my point of view.”For now, though, Froome wants to purely focus on celebrating becoming the first man in 35 years to hold all three grand tours – the Tour de France, the Vuelta a España and the Giro – at the same time, joining Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx in the pantheon.True, there is still one more stage remaining. But the 10 laps of 11.5km around Rome on Sunday evening will be largely processional. To Froome, each one will feel like a fresh victory parade.“It is a very special win,” said Froome. “I know it is not over until Rome but the battle is over now. But there were so many moments when it was extremely hard.”And while beaming from ear to ear, he admitted that there were times he didn’t think his fifth grand tour victory was on the cards.“Obviously the crash right before the prologue in Jerusalem really knocked my confidence, and I was in a lot of pain after that,” he said. “And there were also days where I should have finished in front and I didn’t and I lost time so there have been so many hurdles to overcome. And as we have seen from some, when you have a bad day in these last few days of the Giro you don’t just lose minutes, you can lose tens of minutes.“But my team-mates and the support staff believed in me. They said: ‘Wait, this race is brutal and you are going to get to the last few days and the race can really change.’ And it did.”That was evident on stage 20 as the Frenchman Thibaut Pinot, who started the day in third, lost a staggering 45 minutes – a similar amount that Simon Yates lost on Friday. Froome, however, never looked in any danger of letting slip the 40 seconds he had over his nearest challenger Tom Dumoulin.In theory, the 214km from Susa to Cervinia looked to possess sharp enough teeth to make Froome fear its bite. The final 90km had three climbs, each amounting to almost 20km in duration – with 4,000m of rise and fall along the way. Yet he was only rarely tested and never troubled. After three weeks where he had looked short of his best, Froome the Imperious was back.While the Spaniard Mikel Nieve pulled away on the final climb to celebrate his 34th birthday with a stage win, Froome focused purely on man-marking Dumoulin up the Col Tsecore and then the Col St-Pantaléon.Finally with six kilometres remaining on the road to Cervinia, Dumoulin went for it, attacking three times in rapid succession only to find Froome locked onto his wheel each time he looked over his shoulder. “I gave everything I had,” said Dumoulin. “He was too strong for me. I have no regrets.”Not only was it not enough, but Froome actually looked stronger than ever towards the finish. Indeed, as he made his way over the steepest stretch of the final climb, just before Valtournenche three kilometres out, he powered clear of Dumoulin in a defiant show of strength. As he did so he passed bunches of pink Giro d’Italia balloons, some of which had been popped.A few days ago, when he was fourth in the race and struggling with saddle sores, Froome had looked similarly deflated. But, once again, he and Team Sky somehow found the resolve to deliver when it mattered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80521153bc0099c833e80c604b1c57bc3cbdf493/0_57_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde6e8cfd95fcc29a1f9bde7bc85741a","title":"pakistan blow away england victory first test","story":"After that little oasis of serenity on Saturday evening, England reverted to type. In the space of 25 minutes wild hopefulness gave way to grim haplessness as their second innings subsided from 235-6 to 242 all out.No one was predicting an England victory overnight but it was reasonable to expect that the rearguard action might still be in operation at noon and that they could head to Leeds later this week with something to savour.Instead they will head north, humbled and humiliated, with their confidence in shreds having been thrashed on their own patch at headquarters by a side ranked seventh in the world, two places below them – though that will change if England perform as ineptly at Headingley.Pakistan won by nine wickets they performed superbly but unspectacularly like solid old pros who understand the conditions precisely. And they are supposed to be the callow side. They bowled full and straight and let the ball swing and seam a little they batted with grit and patience and they caught their catches and that was more than enough to overwhelm an England team in some disarray.The England collapse on Sunday morning was numbing. Jos Buttler had batted with great authority on Saturday but in the second over he pushed forward to Mohammad Abbas and was struck on the pad. He reviewed but with no great optimism. Then the new ball polished off the rest at a rush. Mark Wood and Stuart Broad were both caught behind and last man out Dom Bess lost his off-stump. Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Abbas were in clover, sharing four wickets each.In pursuit of the 64 runs needed to win Pakistan lost Azhar Ali to a fine delivery from Jimmy Anderson. Thereafter there were few alarms, though, unlike the first innings, Bess made several deliveries turn but in a hopeless situation he was nowhere near accurate enough to exploit the rough developing outside the left-handers’ off-stump. Rather than inform us about the long-term prospects of Bess excelling at this level this simply demonstrated what an excellent cricket pitch had been provided at Lord’s, even though England had been woefully unable to exploit its properties. It seamed at the start it flattened out and if we had reached the fifth day it would have spun.

Pakistan - who were magnificent throughout - did the rest, collecting the 64 runs they needed in 12.4 overs.Thanks for your company across the four days. We’ll be at Headingley on Friday to do it all again. Keep an eye out for pieces from Vic, Ali Martin and Andy Bull across the afternoon. Bye for now from Lord’s. Mohammad Abbas is the man of the match for his eight wickets. Wasim Akram is interpreting for him in response to Mike Atherton’s questions on Sky. Abbas said he was happy with the lengthy preparation and it helped him agree on the length he was going to bowl in the First Test at Lord’s. He adds that Glenn McGrath and Mohammad Asif are two his heroes and the bowlers he tries to emulate. Joe Root, England captain, at the presentation. “We played some poor shots and gave some wickets away and you can’t afford to do that in Test cricket.” He has no regrets on the toss, though: “If we bat well and get 250 or 300 it is very different on that surface. As a batting group we need to find a way.”More from him shortly at the media conference. Ali Martin will have a story on that soon.Trevor Bayliss, England coach, speaks on BBC.Believes the decision to bat at the toss was a 5050 call. “The problem is that we didn’t bat very well at all. Yes, it was going to be difficult in the first couple of hours but but we just didn’t bat well enough. We simply keep making the same mistakes. We have seen these guys score runs in difficult conditions but we have to do it more often.” On the slip cordon chopping and changing, Bayliss acknowledged the issue. “We haven’t fielded well in the slips,” he said. “It is a bit like the rest of our play, we have a good game then a bad one. We need someone to field at short leg. Cookie is probably our best short leg to the quicks. Rooty has had a go in there this week.” Scrappy. Still waiting to see the captains. The response online is absolutely brutal. I shared the view of Vish Ehantharajah earlier that yesterday at times felt a bit like Hobart when Australia were smashed there by South Africa in November 2016. Having covered both of those annihilations, I certainly share that view 24 hours on. The same despair. A couple of stats from CricViz that stand out.Presentations coming up shortly where we’ll hear from the captains and the man of the match, Abbas certain to take home that gong. What a performance from him.All over inside 90 minutes on day four. To think England came here with actual hope this morning. Instead, they lost four wickets in seven balls to leave just Pakistan 64 to win, which they knocked off in 76 deliveries. “Absolutely walloped,” says Phil Tufnell on TMS. “I can’t remember them playing so badly.” Haris Sohail finishes it in style, popping a full toss from Bess into the grandstand then two balls later clipping him through midwicket for four to win the game! 12th over: Pakistan 56-1 (Imam 18, Haris 29) Joe Root at silly point on his hands and knees as though he’s striving for the final wicket late on day five. A short leg also there, a leg gully too. No surprises where Wood is directing his attack at Imam, then. In saying that, Wood is fuller this over than the two that came before it. Runs from three of the six deliveries around the field. Both teams happy for this to finish asap. Eight to win.11th over: Pakistan 50-1 (Imam 13, Haris 28) Haris Sohail looking fantastic here. It is a shame that his day is nearly done. Admittedly, the first of his two boundaries this over was a case of putting away a Bess full toss. No issues with that. The second required real skill, bisecting the two men in the covers after getting to the pitch. Spot on. 14 to win.10th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Wood sends down a maiden to Imam to slow the Pakistan chase, if briefly. He is really banging it in short of a length as his stock delivery, changing it up with a couple of bouncers. No issues for the opener.9th over: Pakistan 42-1 (Imam 13, Haris 20) Haris into the 20s with another lovely drive through cover, off Bess this time. He looked fantastic in the first innings, before getting out. A nice red inker here will give him plenty of confidence going into Headingley. Not far away now, 22 more required for a famous Pakistani victory.A little factoid here from the BBC: “The last time England lost the first Test of a summer, regardless of what month it began, was in 1995 against West Indies.”8th over: Pakistan 36-1 (Imam 13, Haris 14) Mark Wood getting a chance now in place of Broad. Bowled with excellent pace first time around and immediately into his work here, short to Haris who ducks. When Imam gets down there, he gives him a bumper to begin as well. Fair enough. And then again to finish, trying to leave a bruise by aiming at his body. 7th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Imam 13, Haris 13) Dom Bess on for a twist and I think that’s a good shout from Root. If the debutant can get his first wicket in Test cricket before this is finished, that won’t be for nothing ahead of next week. He is very close with his third ball of doing just that, Imam throwing his hands and missing everything. Loose shot from a ball that had plenty of air. I’ve liked that from Bess, giving the ball a chance to turn from the outset. Frustratingly, his misses his line next up and Imam tickles a four fine. Gosh, then some big spin out of the footmarks that beats Imam and Bairstow (and Stokes), adding three more runs to the sundries column. Bowled. 6th over: Pakistan 27-1 (Imam 12, Haris 9) Forget about that extra half an hour, they’re ticking over nicely here with a couple of boundaries for Haris in this Broad set. The first is in error off the edge, but not to hand. The second is much better, leaning into a lavish cover drive that skips away to the rope in front of the grandstand. 5th over: Pakistan 19-1 (Imam 9, Haris 4) Anderson in from the Pavilion End once more. I don’t expect that he will bowl many overs here with back to back Tests. Runs coming from three deliveries in this over, Haris clipping one, Imam driving three then Haris pushing another. He keeps the strike. But really, nothing to see here. Lunch is an hour away and the umpires have the power to extend the session by half an hour if they believe a result is imminent. In other words, one way or another, this ends before lunch.4th over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Broad charging in from the Nursery End and keeping Imam honest throughout, beating him with a good’un to finish. He receives generous applause from the modest crowd in today. Modest by Sunday at Lord’s standards that is, and for good reason. “‘Obsequies’ is a lovely word, isn’t it?” observes John Starbuck. Funeral rites, the definition (full disclosure: I googled). But yes, that’s what this is.3rd over: Pakistan 14-1 (Imam 6, Haris 2) Haris has three balls to look at, tucking neatly around the corner towards the rope beneath my spot in the press box. A couple for him. Something there for Jimmy, picking up Azhar for the second time in the Test. That’s a beauty too, angling in before nipping past the outside edge, smashing into the off-stump. Can’t ask much more of him this week. 2nd over: Pakistan 11-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 5) “Does this not remind you of Adelaide?” asks Dan Norcross on TMS. Not wrong. A wicket second ball then all over in about an hour. Anyway, Imam’s turn and he’s going to make it count based on the early evidence, playing a glittering off-drive to get off the mark. That’s delightful. A single gets Azhar on strike and Broad beats him immediately.A couple of emails asking about the spot fixing documentary that has just gone live on Al Jazeera. With an abundance of caution, I’m leaving that alone for now, but Ali Martin is writing up a yarn. I’ll post here soon as it is live. 1st over: Pakistan 6-0 (Azhar 4, Imam 0) So, Imam is out there batting despite having copped a bad whack to the groin in the field just before Pakistan’s quicks finished it off. His senior partner Azhar Ali is taking the first ball from Anderson, though. He’s defending to begin before a couple of leg byes get the chase underway to fine leg. Then some runs off the bat to finish off the over, four of them, to third man. Not far from the catcher at third slip, but not to be. They are back on. Jimmy with the ball in his hand with 63 to defend. Yep. Unsurprisingly, the England twitter account have not been posting videos of those wickets. But the clips, if you feel the need to watch them, are alongside the scorecard here (for those reading in the UK). “Do you think England after 141 years of test cricket are in with any chance of improving on Ireland’s five wicket loss to Pakistan in their first ever test?” asks Peter Salmon on the email. “Something to aim for.” In short: no. Aside from the final session yesterday, this has been horrid. As Vish Ehantharajah observed on yesteday, this may well be England’s ‘Hobart Moment’. When Australia were flogged by South Africa there a couple of years ago, five changes followed. Now, that won’t happen. But this side are in real strife at the start of a long summer. By contrast for Pakistan, Abbas finishes with match figures of 8-for-64. Just brilliant.There it is! For all the talk of tricky fourth innings chases, England lost four for seven this morning in 25 balls. It’s emphatic from Amir, uprooting Bess’ off stump. Pakistan need 64 to go one-nil up. Early bath then, lads. 82nd over: England 242-9 (Bess 57, Anderson 0) Jimmy nearly goes first ball! Big inside edge, very lucky it didn’t bend back his leg stump. Oh, I better hit send on this because... (you can probably tell what has happened first delivery of the next over). A second ball blob for Broad, who bags himself a pair. Just a soft prod and Abbas finds the edge on the way through. Test wickets don’t come much easier than that. It came the ball after a lengthy delay when Imam was hit in the groin by a Broad drive that went to point, requiring the young man to leave the field in some distress. But given how small the fourth innings target is going to be, he can put his feet up. England lead by 63, adding only seven to their overnight score, losing three wickets along the way. Oh dear.It takes four deliveries with the second new ball for Amir to find Wood’s outside edge with a ball that nipped away beautifully. No footwork to speak of, but that’s excellent bowling to the tail. The left-armer warmed up rolling a couple down with the old ball, which enabled Bess to get off strike, but Wood didn’t have much of an idea there. Broad walks out on a pair. I did say this could happen quick. 80th over: England 240-7 (Bess 55, Wood 4) Shot. Wood off the mark with a lovely square drive to the rope. He’s happy to leave the rest alone. That’s the final over with the old ball and it is a successful one. It looks like they will take it straight away with Amir immediately on to replace Hasan. We’ll see.Here is the DRS map on the Buttler dismissal. Abbas has taken five LBWs in the match, Andrew Samson tells us on TMS. Nobody has taken six in a Test at Lord’s. He has a big chance to do so here with three England wickets on the shelf with the new nut.No issue with that decision from Paul Reiffel, technology confirming that the ball is hitting middle and leg. Buttler was beaten on the inside edge from a delivery that just hinted back at the right-hander off the seam. More superb bowling from Abbas who is having a mighty Test Match. He’s in the book for a third time with his second ball of the morning. The 126-run stand is broken with England’s lead 57. BUTTLER GIVEN LBW! He’s reviewed. He has to. But it looks pretty good on the first look. Stand by.79th over: England 236-6 (Buttler 67, Bess 55)  Cripes, the third ball of the day has just about run along the ground. Can England hang around long enough for it to matter? Buttler digs out a yorker to cover but can’t beat the man there, but does keep the strike with a single squeezed to third man. Azhar Mahmood ringing the bell. He scored a ton on debut at number eight in 1997, Dan Norcross advises on the wireless. That’s what Dom Bess is trying to do here. If you were wondering, the highest score for an England number eight on debut is Liam Dawson who made 66. He was the last man to debut in that position, as it happens. Bess resumes on 55. I made a mistake in the preamble earlier, by the way (which I’ll be editing in a tic). Keaton Jennings was, of course, the most recent hundred first up for England - not Trotty. Righto. Hasan Ali has the ball in his hand, Joss Buttler is on strike. PLAY! Jos Buttler having a chat on radio. “He (Dom Bess) is a confident boy and he knows his game really well. He’s got a lot of talent with the bat. I’m not sure how many people knew it before this Test, but they do now.” Said from a tricky situation, they showed some “skill and character” to dig in during the final session. “I had the same mentality really, I played the situaiton. I said before the game whether the ball is red, white or pink, I play with the same (approach).”The players are due out in about five minutes and the sun is still poking through the clouds. But the updated forecast isn’t great, heavy rain expected around lunchtime. Speaking of TMS. Getting in before I’m asked, this is the link to listen to their radio coverage via youtube if you are following from outside of the UK. A look at the track. Doesn’t seem the type to misbehave. “I think it has been a tremendous Test Match wicket,” says Michael Vaughan on TMS. Some more on The Hundred from Ali Martin the paper today. Looks like they are going to take it on the road (well, the UAE) to give it a spin later this year.Ultimately the plan is to have the scorecard showing the number of balls going down in each 100-ball innings – regardless of how that number is reached – as the score goes up. One senior ECB official told the Observer this is intended “to help answer the age-old question of ‘who is winning?’” and thus simplify cricket for the uninitiated.Andy Bull on Dom Bess. This line isn’t about the man on debut, but I’ll pull it out as it made me laugh:A lot of dubious thinking goes on at Lord’s on the Saturday of a Test match. Something about it seems to lead people to make the most bizarre decisions. How else does one explain all the preposterous clobber people wear? The blazers with candy-cane stripes, the schoolboy caps, the scarlet slacks, all those men ferreting around in their wardrobes asking: “Darling, have you seen my red trousers? I reckon it’s just the day for them.”Good start. I most certainly tagged my first post as “welcome to day three” rather than day four. You can get stuck into me about that on email the usual way (note the new address, my old account is no longer), or via twitter if you’d prefer. When turning in last night, I thought this was going to be an OBO of the wet weather. How about that storm? Lightning strikes every few seconds for what felt like hours. 50,000 of them, I’m told. Followed by chunks of hail that were more tropical Queensland than London. But fast forward to the morning, and it’s all good at Lord’s.That might not be what England fans necessarily want to hear with the home side still so far behind in this Test, but the forecast says the rain will come again later today. So that gives us is a chance to revel in the work of a couple of lads from the west country who batted beautifully on Saturday afternoon to keep the contest vaguely alive.Without getting too far ahead of myself, Dom Bess has the chance to double his half-century and become the first Englishman since Keaton Jennings to record a hundred on Test debut (and the first ever from number eight). You get chapters in books written about you for that kind of thing. Go on, you good thing.As for the more senior man, Jos Buttler, he said his recall to the XI was like being on debut again, and resuming on 66, can salute for three figures for the first time in the creams for England as well. So, despite how it looks when these two joined 125 runs ago and hopes of a fourth day were fading, there remains more than a bit of interest here. Pakistan have been joyous in their celebrations across three days of this match so far but will be mindful their job is not done. If this incumbent pair can stick around for the bulk of this session, the fourth innings chase will enter nasty territory, much as it was when they batted last in Ireland a couple of weeks ago. No major concerns, but work to do. On the other hand, if they can keep the old ball reversing (or get the second new one going in two overs time) this could be over in a hurry and the visitors will triumph in London again, as they did both 2016 Tests here and the 2017 Champions Trophy Final. They like the capital as much as the city enjoys being in the European Union. Yes, I’ve been working on that gag all week and it still doesn’t work. Adam will be here shortly.

His lead’s down to 2.9sec from Vettel, who’s six ahead of Hamilton in third. Lap 1778. Ricciardo is into the pits, as is Raikkonen, so Ricciardo preserves his lead. Vettel is back in second and Hamilton third. It’s as you were at the start again.Lap 1678. Vettel pits and changes front tyres to ultra-soft, and re-emerges in third, behind Raikkonen but ahead of Bottas. That was a smart change.Lap 1578. Leclerc goes into the pits, as out front Ricciardo leads by more than four seconds from Vettel in second, with Raikkonen now third. Hamilton in fifth has Bottas ahead of him in his sights. Verstappen is up another place to 13th. There was some debris in turn six – possibly from where Stroll had a bump and sustained his puncture. Lap 1378. Ricciardo steps up the pace, leading now by 2.8sec, as Vettel is advised to stay out for now. Hartley pits. Hamilton passes Ocon to move back into the top five. And he can go to the end on these tyres.Lap 1278. Hamilton pits! Moving to ultra-soft tyres, and gets out just behind Ocon in sixth place, ahead of Alonso in seventh. How will Red Bull respond? Meanwhile, Sorotkin’s under investigation again for the team working on his carLap 1178. Vandoorne, Leclerc and Verstappen lap the ailing Stroll. Ricciardo leads by 1.79sec from Vettel, who’s 3.8sec ahead of Hamilton, who’s made no real move so far.Lap 1078. Stroll goes into the pits as Williams grapples with more misery, he switches to super-softs but he’s back in 20th, one behind his penalised team-mate Sirotkin. Ricciardo leads by 1.8sec from Vettel.Lap 978. Watching Verstappen is the game at the moment – he gets up close to local boy Leclerc in front of him, but opts not to overtake at this point. The pace up the front has not increased, with Ricciardo still leads. Meanwhile, Lance Stroll has a puncture – he’s in big trouble here.Lap 878. Hulkenburg’s been heard complaining about the now slower than anticipated pace of the race. Ricciardo still leads by 1.7sec from Vettel. Verstappen moves up another place to 14th – he’s passed six cars in eight laps.Lap 778. Hamilton appears dissatisfied with his front right tyre – he’s more than two seconds behind Vettel. Verstappen tries to pass Stroll on the straight and succeeds. On he charges. Ricciardo still leads.Lap 678. Sorotokin has been given a ten-second stop-go penalty. That’s a harsh blow, effectively a half a minute penalty. Ricciardo still leads by 1.557secLap 578. Verstappen cuts inside Ericsson deftly at a sharp bend to move up another place. He’s driving well from the back. It’s confirmed that Sorotkin is under investigation for his wheel not being fitted in time, which leaves him at risk of a five-second penalty.Lap 478. No changes at all in the top 10 yet, with Ricciardo still holding his lead at around the 1.3sec mark, Hamilton is a further 1.6sec behind Vettel.Lap 378. They’re expecting the leaders’ hypersofts to last 15 laps as Ricciardo extends his lead to 1.45secs.

Ricciardo has a lead of +1.3sec from Vettel in second, Hamilton still in third. It’s a fair old pace. The top three look quite comfortably clear at the moment. Lap 178.

Hartley loses his front wing as Stroll tries to pass him in 15thAway they go.Sergey Sorotkin has a problem before the start, his wheels and tyres weren’t fitted three minutes before lights out, so he could be in trouble for that.Toto Wolff says the most important thing for Hamilton is a “good getaway and good result from turn one”, and is making a podium place the main aim today.Max Verstappen, starting at the back, is asked by Brundle whether he’ll attack from the off but responds that his aim is to “just finish the race, that’s the most important thing”. Anyway, the anthem is done. and we’re almost ready.Martin Brundle begins his gridwalk, with three-time Monaco winner Nico Rosberg alongside him. Rosberg predicts a one-stop race with a change to ultra tyres at it. In gender-politics news, there’s grid girls and grid boys here, which feels like a very F1 response. A slightly anxious looking Ross Brawn admits it’ll be challenging for Ricciardo out the front without Verstappen up there with him and admits “we will have to consider a change of approach for future grands prix”. No rain at present, by the way.They’re off on their sighter laps now, ahead of the 78 demanding racing ones that await. The circuit’s looking lightning fast with these hyper-soft tyres. In celeb news, Hugh Grant has just rocked up, here with Ferrari. Ricciardo makes his way towards his car, wearing a confident grin. He is, of course, without a team-mate up front with him today due to Max Verstappen’s crash in practice. Rain appears to have stopped, for now.There had been some pre-race muttering about Ferrari’s engines, with some rivals claiming the Italian team had found a way around electrical energy restrictions with a battery system they believed to be illegal, but the FIA has declared itself satisfied.Weather report: some spots of rain about, which could put cat among pigeons, though the forecast is better for later. Might all that favour Hamilton? Talking of which, he’s recalling past victories in Monaco on Sky’s coverage, including champagne celebrations with P-Diddy, as you do.Giles Richards had an enjoyable chinwag with Mika Hakkinen, “relaxing on a yacht” natch, about his memorable triumph here in 1998 and the magic of Monaco:Afternoon everyone. So this glamour-drenched sporting weekend moves on to its most opulent – nay, decadent – showpiece event: the Monaco Grand Prix. The sun, the sea, the random apparently-interested celebrities. More than anything though, there’s serious racing to be done. Daniel Ricciardo may never get a better chance to atone for his 2016 misfortune on this circuit than the one he has carved out for himself this weekend. An imperious drive in qualifying has given him a commanding pole, and this race is his to squander.Ricciardo will have Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton in his mirrors though, poised to capitalise on any mis-steps on a street circuit where overtaking is always tricky. For Hamilton, half the battle will be keeping Vettel at bay in the overall standings, in which the British Mercedes driver leads his Ferrari rival by 17 points. Both have won twice here – Vettel last year and in 2011, Hamilton in 2016 and 2008, capitalising on the team error that scuppered Ricciardo.Hamilton, and Mercedes, are by no means confident that their car is massively suited to Monaco’s winding twisting track. All the top 10 drivers are expected to start on Pirelli’s new hyper-soft tyres for what is likely to be a one-stop race.Here’s how they line up on the grid:Lights out 2.10pm BST.

The series, which esees a dozen or so drag queens battle it out each season to be crowned “America’s next drag superstar”, isn’t the first to bring drag into the mainstream, but it has certainly shoved it centre-stage. Nowhere is this more the case than in the Werq the World Tour, where a bevy of former contestants, a compere and four underdressed, overenthused dancers show their gifts to the world. It’s a bit like the Strictly tour, but everyone is more open about using Botox. Tonight at the Troxy, the audience could be any pop crowd. The show is loved by people of all shapes and sizes, and the clientele is noticeably mixed, with nearly as many women as men. In fact it’s the women who seem to have got into the spirit more, wearing wigs, hats and glitter, while the men tend to play it more, well, straight. Perhaps dressing up as a woman is a job best left to the professionals. Because they are professionals. One of the reasons Drag Race is such a hit is because it relies on real craft, each contestant producing their own looks and routines. If the opener, Kennedy Davenport, gives us something quite classic – Beyoncé high-kicks to a Rio carnival-style megamix – it’s not long before we meet Sharon Needles, winner of season four. Coming on like the lost child of Cher and Elizabeth Báthory, mouthing quotes from The Exorcist, Needles soon treats us to a performance of her single, Black Licorice, while a video shows a dead rabbit decomposing. The show ploughs on, aided by more star turns: Violet Chachki makes a stunning old-school showgirl in nocturnal blue, contorting herself circus-style on an aerial hoop Detox gives us lurid sex-club Madonna with more aplomb these days than the real thing. But they all succeed, really, because they have charisma to spare. Even if Kim Chi can’t lip-sync so well, even if Latrice Royale’s rap is a little messy, the goodwill outweighs the clunkiness 10 to one. And the compere, Lady Bunny, does fine. Her shtick is based on old variety comedy gals, all beehives and dirty jokes. She’s presumably referencing the likes of Carol Burnett, although she had me thinking of Carol Thatcher on LSD. The star of the show, though, was a queen of a whole other order. Halfway through, four audience members were summoned onstage to lip-sync a pop classic of their own. The clear winner was a woman who did Proud Mary with such enthusiasm and ease that she had surely been waiting for this moment all her life. She gave a nice acceptance speech too. “Next stop, Britain’s Got Talent!” said Lady Bunny when she got the microphone back. Compliment or shade? In Drag Race’s world, the two go gloriously together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0caf4aa36f624622667fd42879ce3e4f52094f60/0_279_5499_3299/master/5499.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6f469deb82eab66e22cb7331ada5c12","title":"the baroque delights of antwerp","story":"Historic Antwerp is opening its gilded stucco doors to lovers of Europe’s most decadent styleAntwerp was once the mighty cog that turned world trade. Sitting at the mouth of the River Scheldt, it dominated international 16th-century markets in sugar, spices and textiles. Today it is still an improbably cosmopolitan place for its size, but is better known for its international diamond business and, less alluringly, as the port that sucks in more cocaine than any other. It recently overtook London as cocaine capital of Europe.The city was also famed for its great Flemish art, from the huge religious panels of Rubens to the royal portraits by Van Dyck and all those detailed still life tables, laden with silverware, meat and fruit.In the past few years, the run of hit historical novels and dramas set in the dimly lit, 17th-century luxury of the Low Countries (Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) has raised its profile, too. Mysterious romances, including The Girl with the Pearl Earring, Tulip Fever and The Miniaturist, have all helped to remind us how intriguing this moneyed part of northern Europe once was.Next weekend (1-3 June), Antwerp is to seize upon just one word to help it celebrate its creative history: baroque. These days it often implies something deemed too ornate, but four centuries ago the baroque movement swept in on a surge of Catholic decorative excess that has left a deep imprint on Antwerp’s architecture. “Antwerp Baroque 2018” will be exploring these themes in a series of art events around the city.Most visitors head for the famous Grote Markt – the main square in the old quarter – but I was just as bowled over by the carefully restored homes of a former 17th-century mayor, Nicolaas Rockox, and his neighbour, the painter Frans Snijders, both brimming with baroque self-confidence. Snijders was well known for painting snarling dogs, dead game carcasses and exotic birds.More squeamish tourists may want to focus on the ornate vases of flowers painted by Clara Peeters – a once-famous Flemish artist born at the turn of the 16th century who is only now being recognised again. (When Madrid’s Prado showed her work in 2016, she became the first female artist to have a solo exhibition there.)The baroque mood continues at full tilt inside the nearby church of St Charles Borromeo, packed with sweeping gestures and the theatricality of the age. If you have ever been underwhelmed in Britain by the pared-down aesthetic of a draughty church, then this house of prayer in Antwerp is the antidote. The carved woodwork of the pulpit and the sculpted Carrara marble in the chapels are a lesson in 17th-century bling.The big draw here though is Peter Paul Rubens’s panel Return of the Holy Family from Jerusalem which the church bought back at auction six years ago so that it could be returned to its position at the left of the altar, where the artist wanted it.A fluffy Belgian waffle, or perhaps a pint of blonde beer at Den Engel on the Grote Markt, is probably the right way to regain strength for the next leg of the baroque tour. It would be silly to leave out Rubens’s own home, which is being especially renovated for the summer. His imposing Italianate arch will soon be revealed in its original wonder. And his glamorous self-portrait, a kind of promotional calling card, is newly on display in pride of place, although it had to compete for public interest on the morning I was there with the Tintoretto that David Bowie owned. The most impressive show for Rubens fans, however, lies inside the cathedral that rises above the rest of the old city.For some baroque light refreshment try Elfde Gebod bar and café just next to the cathedral. The interior is awash with gilt and religious icons alongside an impressive range of Belgium beers.Beyond the city are the green spaces of Middelheim, a favourite of the old rich burghers of Antwerp who would come here to escape the crush of the port. Now it’s Europe’s first permanent sculpture garden set over 30 acres. With two large wooded areas separated by a road, it is dotted with famous forms, from a Henry Moore and a Barbara Hepworth, to Antony Gormley’s metallic astronomical web. Next month these sculptures will be joined by a new set of commissions dubbed “Experience Traps” as part of the festival.The ultimate antidote to a baroque-filled day is an evening meal in the restaurant RAS (restaurant on the stream), an airy, modern and minimalist interior on the riverbank, with views across the river through an expanse of floor-to-ceiling glass windows. The food is similarly pared back: a fine blend of nouvelle cuisine and traditional dishes.Walking back through the Grote Markt afterwards, I noticed that the Brabo fountain in the middle of the square features a man holding a severed hand in a grim reference to the myth of the giant who lopped off sailors’ hands and hurled them into the Scheldt. The story is also remembered in the shape of the chocolates and biscuits sold all over the city. Somehow it seems an essentially baroque detail. After all, the word baroque derives from the idea of an “imperfect pearl”: something lustrous with a beguiling flaw.Eurostar trains from London via Brussels to Antwerp’s baroque main station cost from £70 return.

His first Rabbit novel, Rabbit, Run, was published in 1960, and his last, Rabbit at Rest, in 1990.Rabbit is a sometimes monstrous, selfish character. He leaves his pregnant wife at the start of the novel and later moves in with a sex worker.The project raises the question of how, in the era of #MeToo, TV and film-makers should depict behaviour that is no longer considered acceptable.The script editor Laura Lankester said there was no getting around the fact that people in the 1960s behaved the way they did, and there was a balancing act in not denying it, and in portraying it in an acceptable way for a contemporary audience.Davies said: “I think they behave exactly the same now, but it is kind of wrong now.”The 81-year-old said he had the advantage of working with much younger people than himself, including a script editor in her mid-20s. “She has had problems with some bits of Rabbit Run and it has been very interesting to deal with all that,” he said.“We do want people, if not to love Rabbit but at least to understand him. Some of the things have been a bit difficult for young intelligent females to cope with … but I think his insight into both men and women is just so extraordinary.”Davies was at Hay to talk about his adaptation of Les Misérables, Victor Hugo’s epic story of social injustice. It will be shown on the BBC One later this year with a cast that includes David Oyelowo as Javert, Dominic West as Jean Valjean, Olivia Colman as Madame Thénardier, Josh O’Connor as Marius and Lily Collins as Fantine.Other TV projects include an adaptation of Vikram Seth’s A Suitable Boy and potentially a mash-up of the novels of Alison Lurie. Davies says he plans to continue what he does at least until he was 90. “I’ve bought a new car, so I plan to at least get my money’s worth out of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/404a3f06163275ce1ff22f3f15e3ee9b65ebe87e/0_98_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c85933c218893d9a0dc56e807660d5f","title":"clarke gayford jacinda ardern new zealand","story":"The TV host and partner of Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, gets ready to become a stay-at-home dad On Friday, in the freezing pre-dawn, as wild winter rainstorms battered Auckland, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, got up to catch a plane. She was heading to Taranaki, the energy-rich province on the North Island, to defend her government’s decision to ban future offshore oil and gas exploration. Earlier in the week she had faced up to farmers about the spread of the cattle disease Mycoplasma bovis and sanctioned her transport minister, who had unlawfully used a mobile phone on a plane.At the end of the week, weary from the ear-bashing from oil bosses and the realities of late-stage pregnancy, she headed home to the unassuming bungalow on a quiet street she shares with her partner, fishing show host Clarke Gayford.Because it’s Friday, the cabinet papers are waiting for her, and she’ll probably work on them until about 10.30pm. “Not an abnormal day,” says Gayford. That morning at 5am they had groggily discussed what she might want to eat for dinner. What could the“first bloke” of New Zealand cook for the future mother of the nation? Meatballs, she said. So Gayford, an enthusiastic if not expert cook, is on the hunt for a tasty meatball recipe.Less than a month away from the birth – which will make Ardern the first serving head of government since Benazir Bhutto to have a baby – Gayford, who will be a stay-at-home dad, is as ready as you can be. A room has been prepared, piles of baby “accoutrements” bought, and parenting advice has been accepted from Barack Obama (don’t panic it’s OK to make mistakes). “How can you prepare?” he says in the thoughtfully decorated, cosy home. They’ve installed central heating since buying it a few months ago because Ardern is no fan of the cold.Gayford, a radio and TV broadcaster, has thicker skin. It’s less than a month since malicious rumours about his personal life reached such a fever pitch that the police issued an unprecedented statement clearing him of any wrongdoing. What was it like to be smeared?“If I talk about it now, it just pours more petrol on it,” he says. But the instinct to watch his behaviour, already instilled by a life in the media, have been sharpened since meeting Ardern four years ago. While he’s had to rein in his enthusiasm for “a good rant on Facebook” – and has felt “like a right chump” editing his own Wikipedia page because the fake news that he was once a police cadet kept coming up in interviews – he keeps coming back to the “higher cause” of social justice and environmental action he sees Ardern getting on with.Even so, recent weeks have been quite an eye-opener for the fishing-mad boy from sleepy Gisborne. Accompanying Ardern on a trip to Europe that took in the Commonwealth heads of government meetings, he felt right at home with the royal family: “Jacinda was given probably one of the longer audiences with Camilla and Charles.” The heir to the throne wanted to chat about fishing and advocacy groups. At dinner, Ardern exchanged notes on parenting with Prince William, while Gayford was next to “hilarious” Princess Anne.He’s lucky that he gets to dip in and out of the “surreal” part of his partner’s job. With time to spare recently he felt the need to “reset”, so jumped in his old ute and drove to Gisborne to see a mate who “literally lives in the bush” and spent a couple of days out on the water.It may be a while till the next reset. Ardern plans to return to work six weeks after her due date, 17 June, relieving deputy PM Winston Peters, and Gayford will be at home with the baby. “It’s going to be quite a bit different, isn’t it?” How does he function on little sleep? “I’m hoping my years of DJing will pay off.”His parenting role models are his sisters – one who has three boys under four, the other two young girls. “I’m in their world a lot. You get a warts-and-all commentary. And my parents, of course.” His farmer father introduced him to the outdoors, fishing, surfing. He’s also had lots of stay-at-home dads coming up to him. “It’s all completely normal for them.”He will be back working himself soon. The third season of his TV show, Fish of the Day, which travels the Pacific in search of impressive catches and a fine meal, is due to be produced next summer, though this will, of course, depend on baby. Gayford will have to be even more regimented, he accepts, and parents will have to be called on for favours. The couple will have to travel a lot, and he will probably move to Wellington for a while with the child.Gayford made headlines again earlier this month when he posted a picture of himself on Twitter fending off a shark. Will he still be fighting off bronze whalers once the baby arrives? He’s actually quite cautious, he says, and has stopped pushing himself so much after having a blackout in the water. But there’s a plus to being next to a frightening sea creature: “It’s those moments that make you feel truly alive.”The world will want to see the child, so how will they balance the public interest and their own privacy? They haven’t had a proper discussion yet, but he’s optimistic that interest will taper off: “At the end of the day, we’re just New Zealanders. We all know each other. Life still goes on as per normal.”The couple say there will be no full-time nanny, but in this green-minded household – an electric car is charging in the driveway and he hasn’t used a plastic bag this year – the question of cloth nappies or disposables is proving a tricky one. It’s hard to find reusables for newborns, he says, but they’ll do their best.They have kept the sex of the child to themselves, though Radio NZ suggested that Clarke had said he was keen to meet “her”. What kind of child do they expect? “With each trip to your scans, where you see a little face developing, you start to think about all the projections you have on them as a person.”Have they thought about what their child will inherit? “There’s a strong line of Gayford noses.” And temperament? He’s read how an expectant mother “should be calm and clearheaded with thoughts of bunnies and fields” as he watches his partner in robust parliamentary debate. “I’m hoping the child picks up some of mum’s temperament.”Childhood Raised on a farm, eldest of three.

This made Israel the UK’s eighth largest market for UK arms companies, a huge increase on the previous year’s figure of £86m, itself a substantial rise on the £20m worth of arms licensed in 2015. In total, over the past five years, Israel has bought more than £350m worth of UK military hardware.Licences issued to UK defence contractors exporting to Israel last year include those for targeting equipment, small arms ammunition, missiles, weapon sights and sniper rifles. In 2016 the UK issued licences for anti-armour ammunition, gun mountings, components for air-to-air missiles, targeting equipment, components for assault rifles, components for grenade-launchers and anti-riot shields.Human rights groups have questioned the wisdom of sending a senior royal to a country whose use of lethal force last month has been the subject of concern from the UK\u0026nbspgovernment.“After the appallingly excessive response of the Israeli security forces at the Gaza border, tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories are likely to be close to boiling point when Prince William makes this historic visit,” said Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s campaigns director.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, defended Israel’s response, saying “every country has an obligation to defend its borders”. But Theresa May backed calls for an independent inquiry into the violence, which reportedly left 58 Palestinians dead. The British prime minister said the use of live rounds by Israeli forces was “deeply troubling” and called for greater restraint. Now the UK government faces questions as to whether UK-made weapons were used by the Israelis last month.A review by government found the UK had issued 12 licences for arms it believed were likely to have been used in the 2014 war. In 2010 the then foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Israeli equipment used in an attack on Gaza “almost certainly” contained British-supplied components.Andrew Smith of Campaign Against Arms Trade said: “The shootings we have seen over recent weeks have been an awful reminder of the appalling collective punishment and oppression that has been inflicted on the people of Gaza. By the government’s own admission, UK arms have been used time and again against Palestinians. Yet the arms sales have continued unabated. There must be a full investigation into if any UK arms have been used in the atrocities we have seen over recent months.”The Duke of Cambridge’s five-day trip will begin in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday 24 June, take in Ramallah, the Palestinian Authority’s capital city, and end in Jerusalem. Netanyahu has said it will be “a historic visit, the first of its kind”.But Smith said it was taking place against the “backdrop of a massacre”. He added: “If the prince does not speak out against the violence that has been inflicted, then it will be regarded as a major political endorsement. He must not use his visit to whitewash or legitimise these terrible abuses.”Moscogiuri said: “When he’s in Ramallah, we’d like to see Prince William going beyond the usual royal meet-and-greet by spending time talking with some of the Palestinian communities who’ve been affected by Israel’s 51-year occupation. Like everyone in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, people in Ramallah have endured years of discriminatory restrictions on their movement, with roadblocks, militarised checkpoints and off-limits roads which are for the exclusive use of those in the illegal Israeli settlements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a783d90a116bd0b528ea95ef3062b12785d96e75/0_139_3042_1825/master/3042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aaf14d658f3b8899e6738e8566569b26","title":"colombians vote for new president in wake of farc peace process","story":"Sunday’s presidential election comes after race dominated by a rightwing hardliner and a former rebelColombia is heading to the polls to choose a president in an election that could prove decisive for the country’s embattled peace process with the Farc leftist guerrillas.The more mainstream candidates – Sergio Fajardo, Humberto de la Calle and Germán Vargas Lleras – are all polling badly, indicating a polarised electorate.While economic reform, pledges to weed out corruption and the crisis in neighbouring Venezuela have all been talking points in the run-up to the election, few issues ide voters like the peace process.Colombia’s outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, reached a deal with the Farc, or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, in late 2016 to end five decades of war which left more than 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced.However, despite international plaudits and a Nobel peace prize, Santos never managed to sell the deal at home, where the accord failed to pass a public referendum before being amended and ratified in Congress.Those revisions were not enough to assuage the concerns of many Colombians who felt that light sentencing for war crimes and guarantees of seats for the Farc in Congress were too high a price for peace. Those voters have another opportunity to register their grievances on Sunday.“If Duque wins, the peace process will be in doubt,” said Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, a US thinktank. He said many Duque supporters were wealthy landowners whose interests would be hit by the peace deal’s promise for rural reform. “The biggest part of the accord could just go into the trashcan,” Isacson said.Petro, himself a former rebel with the long-defunct M-19 group, is the first leftist in generations with a shot at the presidency, in large part thanks to the following of young voters attracted by his anti-establishment platform. Petro’s critics worry he will abandon Colombia’s market-friendly attitude, with some saying he will ape the policies of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom some blame for that country’s economic turmoil and the influx of a million Venezuelans into Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Chávez.Though Petro supports the peace process, observers doubt he has won over enough moderates to win the election. Even so, his candidacy is seen as a testament to the peace process, because previously leftists would be associated with the Farc. “The peace process has created a lot more space for the political left,” Isacson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a21a7dd9bb8b6312d3bfe770168391870e794c/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f89a12c88d46810d6319b859851fe82","title":"egypt blocks youtube over film denigrating prophet muhammad","story":"Court ruling ends years-long appeals process over film that sparked deadly anti-US riotsEgypt’s top administrative court ordered authorities to block video-sharing website YouTube for a month over a film denigrating Islam’s prophet Muhammad.

The atmosphere was “just like an ordinary meeting between friends” and the two held “candid talks”, Moon said. A video released by the South Korean presidential office had the audio replaced with dramatic music, showing the two men embracing, both with wide smiles.The spontaneous offer by Kim to meet, and Moon’s quick acceptance, shows how close the two leaders have become in a short period of time. It capped a whirlwind 24 hours of diplomacy as Moon scrambled to salvage a 12 June summit between Trump and Kim in Singapore after Trump abruptly cancelled the meeting on Thursday.But on Saturday evening in the US as Moon was briefing reporters on his meeting with Kim, Trump suggested the US-North Korea summit could go ahead as originally planned.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”Kim “once again committed to complete denuclearisation”, Moon said. But he repeatedly refused to answer questions on the specifics of how North Korea would relinquish its nuclear weapons or if they would allow international experts to inspect nuclear facilities. The thorny issue of how exactly the North would give up its nuclear weapons has consistently hung over discussions between Washington and Pyongyang.US officials have demanded North Korea unilaterally disarm before concessions are granted on economic sanctions or a pledge of non-aggression, while Pyongyang prefers a phased negotiations and concessions from the US. Kim expressed “his fixed will on the historic” meeting with Trump, according to the North’s state run Korean Central News Agency. Photos of the Moon-Kim meeting were printed on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun, the ruling Workers’ party newspaper. “It’s strategically smart for Kim to invite Moon for a face to face meeting, it helps portray him in the public eye as a very friendly, diplomacy-oriented statesman,” said Jenny Town, managing editor of monitoring group 38 North. “It really offsets the tone Kim’s regime has put forward with statements threatening nuclear war.”But she warned there was still a chasm between Washington and Pyongyang on core issues, saying there was little point in holding a US-North Korea summit that lacked substance.“This is not diplomacy, it’s political theatre,” Town said. “There is no trust between the two right now, so why would Kim trust any US security guarantee on paper? Trust on both sides need to be built over time and no one should expect Trump to fly to Singapore and leave with all of North Korea’s nukes.” “The path to complete denuclearisation and full peace was never going to be an easy one,” Moon said. But he added, “I’m sure we will succeed”.Moon also said he hoped there could be a meeting between North Korea, South Korea and the US to formally end the 1950-53 Korean war, which ended in an armistice rather than a full peace treaty. He praised Kim for announcing a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, as well as the closing of the country’s nuclear test site this week.The two sides would hold “high-level talks” on 1 June as well as military discussions to reduce tensions and efforts to set up reunions between ided families."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134b02a2860ea8c715a3572a5b880eba53391a75/274_182_3624_2175/master/3624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c50b32659d73fc959013b84511f8e0c","title":"pakistan election date nawaz sharif imran khan","story":"Election to pit ruling PML-N party against that of former cricket star Imran KhanPakistan will hold a general election on 25 July in what could be only the second democratic transfer of power in the nuclear-armed country’s history.The election is expected to pit the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party against former cricket star Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.Khan’s party vowed Sunday to oust the country’s “corrupt” rulers. “The Pakistani nation ... can see the dawn of a new Pakistan, which will not be ruled by the corrupt,” PTI said in a statement posted on Twitter along with a graphic that read “Mafia’s Game Over”.“Stop us if you can,” it said in another tweet.Turmoil continues to rock the country after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was ousted by the supreme court in July 2017 on corruption charges and later barred from politics for life.Sharif was the 15th prime minister in Pakistan’s seven-decade history – roughly half of it under military rule – to be removed before completing a full term. After Sharif was ousted, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi took over the premiership.Pakistan completed its first ever democratic transfer of power after elections in 2013, when PML-N took over from the Pakistan People’s party following a landslide victory.“This is the second consecutive parliament to complete its tenure and we are now looking forward to go to the people to get their verdict on our performance,” the finance minister, Miftah Ismail, said.While PTI is vowing to clean up the country’s rampant corruption, and invest in education and healthcare, PML-N continues to boast of its investment in the country’s rickety infrastructure and courting billions of dollars in Chinese investment.Since he was ousted, Sharif and PML-N have become increasingly vocal in their confrontation with the country’s military establishment and courts, claiming they are victims of a conspiracy. Despite the numerous court rulings against PML-N, the party has won a string of recent byelections. It continues to enjoy significant support in the country’s most populous Punjab province, but will enter the election under increasing pressure.In April, a Pakistan court disqualified the foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, for violating the country’s election laws, while the interior minister, Ahsan Iqbal, was shot in the arm in a suspected assassination attempt in early May by an Islamist gunman. Sharif also sparked a firestorm earlier this month after suggesting Pakistani militants were behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks, approaching what is seen as a red line in the country by touching on criticism of Pakistan’s armed forces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510170.1527418217!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland gets an update","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tYes campaigners celebrate the official result of the Irish abortion referendum at Dublin Castle in Dublin on May 26th, 2018.

Photograph: South Korea Presidential Blue HouseAP North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reaffirmed his commitment to “complete” denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and to a planned meeting with US president Donald Trump, South Korean president Moon Jae-in said on Sunday.In Washington, Mr Trump signalled that preparations for the summit with Kim were going ahead.Mr Moon and Mr Kim agreed at a surprise meeting on Saturday that a possible North Korea-US summit must be held successfully, Mr Moon told a news conference in Seoul.“Chairman Kim and I have agreed that the June 12 summit should be held successfully, and that our quest for the Korean peninsula’s denuclearisation and a perpetual peace regime should not be halted,” Moon said.The meeting was the latest dramatic turn in a week of diplomatic ups and downs surrounding the prospects for an unprecedented summit between the United States and North Korea, and the strongest sign yet that the two Korean leaders are trying to keep the on-again off-again meeting on track.A statement from North Korea’s state news agency KCNA said Mr Kim expressed “his fixed will” on the possibility of meeting Mr Trump as previously planned.Mr Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Mr Trump in Washington in a bid to keep the high-stakes US-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Mr Trump’s “firm will” to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.While maintaining that Mr Kim is commited to denuclearisation, Mr Moon acknowledged Pyongyang and Washington may have differing expectations of what that means, and he urged both sides to hold working-level talks to resolve their differences.In a letter to Mr Kim on Thursday, Mr Trump had said he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea’s “open hostility.”But on Saturday, Trump said he was still looking at a June 12th date for a summit in Singapore, adding that talks were progressing very well.“We’re doing very well in terms of the summit with North Korea,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “It’s moving along very nicely. So we’re looking at June 12th in Singapore. That hasn’t changed. So, we’ll see what happens.”A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.The Trump administration is demanding that North Korea completely and irreversibly shutter its nuclear weapons program. Mr Kim and Mr Trump’s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.Mr Moon said he held Saturday’s impromptu meeting, the second summit between the two sides in a month, at Mr Kim’s request.“Chairman Kim requested a meeting without any formality two days ago and I gladly accepted it,” Mr Moon said, noting that the summit was in line with previous agreements for the two leaders to meet more often.“A meeting was held because officials of both countries thought that meeting face-to-face would be better than a phone call,” Mr Moon said.Their talks at the Panmunjom border village, which South Korean officials said lasted two hours, came after their April 27th meeting, the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade that was also held at the same venue. At that meeting, they declared they would work toward a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War.The KCNA statement said Mr Kim and Mr Moon agreed to hold high-level talks between their two nations on June 1st, and to take steps to quickly implement their efforts to denuclearize the peninsula. KCNA said the leaders also agreed to meet frequently.The agency said the two leaders had reached a “satisfactory consensus” and expressed “their stand to make joint efforts for the decentralization of the Korean peninsula.”Mr Moon said while Mr Kim is committed to denuclearisation, North Korea is not convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.“However, during the US-South Korea summit, president Trump clearly emphasised that we may see not only the end of hostile relations but also economic cooperation if North Korea denuclearises,” Mr Moon said. “I urge North Korea and the US to confirm each other’s will by sharing their problems with each other and communicating directly.”A senior South Korean official later said that the two Koreas are discussing a possible non-aggression pledge and the start of peace treaty talks as a way of addressing Pyongyang’s security concerns ahead of US-North Korean negotiations.Video and a photo released by South Korea’s presidential Blue House on Saturday showed Mr Kim hugging Mr Moon and kissing him on the cheek three times as he saw Mr Moon off after their meeting at Tongilgak, the North’s building in the truce village, which lies in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - the 4 km wide buffer that runs along the heavily armed military border.Mr Moon is the only South Korean leader to have met a North Korean leader twice, both times in the DMZ, which is a symbol of the unending hostilities between the nations after the Korean War ended in 1953 in a truce, not a peace treaty. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508377.1527276417!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"get your voice heard on brexit talks corbyn urges ni politicians","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain’s Labour Party, poses for a selfie with Prof Deirdre Heenan during a visit to Lifford Bridge on the Border.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireNorthern Ireland needs a voice at the Brexit talks table in London, British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said, as he urged Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party to reach a deal on restoring Stormont. “Please, to the parties in Stormont: you have to come together to re-form a government there. I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade. The EU is not a foreign, far-away bureaucracy – it’s a couple of miles from where we sit. “It’s where many of our staff live and where we find our customers and trading partners. Everybody accepts that it would be unacceptable to reintroduce a hard Border in Ireland.”However, she warned that it is “infinitely more difficult to understand” the declarations from London politicians that the UK “can pull out of the customs union and single market” and avoid a hard Border.“The truth is we just cannot see how you can square this circle: to both leave the EU and to ensure no Border – to create the unique solution for NI Ireland and to do it without damaging our peace and prosperity.”Speaking directly to Mr Corbyn, she said the customs union and single market offer a market of 500 million people: “It’s under those conditions that we have built the business community that you are sitting with this morning.”Warning that local patience is “wearing thin”, she insisted that the British government’s favoured options of a customs partnership, or a technological deal to solve Border issues do not “inspire confidence”.Urging more British politicians to visit Northern Ireland, Bonnie Anley, the chair of Foyle Port, said it is “vital” that they “experience and see” the day-to-day realities that are now facing local firms.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508434.1527260323!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a lady laid to rest far from the ireland she left so long ago","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe memorial card for Sr Tricia (Trish) Freeman from her convent in San Antonio, Texas.Late last year, on a reporting trip in Texas, I found myself in the picturesque city of San Antonio, about three hours’ drive north of the Mexican border. Faced with a free afternoon, I contacted my mother in Ireland – isn’t San Antonio where Aunty Trish lives?Trish Freeman was the last surviving sibling of nine brothers and sisters from Cullohill in Co Laois. She emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, joining a convent like many women of her generation.After a few phone calls I found myself at the University of the Incarnate Word on the outskirts of the city. This modern university campus also houses a retirement home, church and living quarters for older nuns and lay people who come to spend their final years.Walking in the door I was transported back to the convent schools of Ireland – the spotlessness, the hushed atmosphere of quiet industriousness, the faint rays of warm sunlight fanned out on the polished floor.Inside the dining hall, waiting patiently, was Aunty Trish, wearing an eye-catching colourful shirt, her hair neatly-coiffed. Now 98, she hadn’t changed much since I had seen her on her last visit to Ireland 17 years ago. \u0026nbspDespite being one of only two of my grandfather’s siblings to join a religious order, she had always somehow managed to be the most modern. She emailed us from Texas when the internet was in its early days, somehow insinuating to us that America – even for nuns – was a hipper place than Ireland in those pre-Celtic Tiger days.On her visits to Ireland she would swiftly do the rounds of the extended family, directly asking her nieces and nephews how their work and studies were going, displaying a unique mix of American directness and social snobbery that characterises a certain class of Irish nun.Now, in this quiet hall in San Antonio, we sat and talked. Though still able to move around on her zimmer frame, she had had a fall in recent months.But she still had her old spark.I explained to her that I was now living in Washington and writing about Donald Trump. “You’d want to watch him,” she shot back with a smile.Our talk turned to the past, to Ireland, to her life in the United States.Born in 1919, she left Ireland for America in 1936 at the age of 17. “We had such fun on that boat trip over,” she recalled in her distinctive Irish-American drawl, “but you know, we got into trouble for running around the boat. I mean, c’mon, it was crazy, we were only having some fun!” She told me that she was separated by the convent from her sister Bride when she arrived in America. “The thinking was that it wasn’t good to have two sisters together as we’d distract each other,” she says, raising her eyebrows with a sigh.But her life in America and in the convent was immensely fulfilling, she said. \u0026nbspShe began her career teaching first grade in St Louis, Missouri, then went on to Illinois, before moving to Texas where she rejoined Bride. Many of her students were Mexican immigrants, and she was passionate about the power of education. “Praise a child and they’ll give you the world,” she once said to my mother, who was training to be a teacher.I asked her had she any regrets about leaving Ireland. “Not at all,” she said definitively. “America gave me a wonderful life.”As we joined the other nuns for tea, the talk – like everywhere in the US – turned to Donald Trump. “He is simply dreadful,” said one sister, originally from Co Galway, as she poured the tea. Another nun, Dublin-born, spoke about Barack Obama. “He was such a kind, kind man. A man of compassion,” she said to sighs of agreement from her friends.As the sun began to set, we walked outside to a small cemetery. There, under the cool shade of a huge oak tree, lay the grave of Trish’s sister, Bride, my grandaunt who died in the 1960s. Stretching in neat, simple rows were the graves of dozens of Irish women, from Galway, Dublin, Kerry, Wexford. Looking out at the quiet, peaceful scene, I thought of those women lying so far from where they started out in life, departing an Ireland that now seems unrecognisable to a woman of my generation.Last week we got the call to say that Sr Trish had passed away, surrounded by her fellow sisters who had kept vigil through the night. She had not quite reached her 100th year, but like many Irish emigrants, she had made her own mark on America.

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Jacob Rees-Mogg: NI abortion law is \u0026#39an issue of devolution\u0026#39Photo Dispatch: Death of the American motorcycle - and the search for next generation of riders\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 delivers up to 20,000 lightning strikes – as Stansted fuel system hitGuitar maker Fender among firms raided in price-fix probeFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Comment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herMutiny Festival cancelled after two people die amid warnings of \u0026#39high strength or bad batch\u0026#39 substancesKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inSchools to let students study technical qualifications instead of A-levelsComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideFear over \u0026#39secret\u0026#39 Government plan for UK to stay in EU after deadline as cash set aside for European electionsComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

Whilst A levels provide a world class academic qualification, many technical education courses are undervalued by employers and don’t always provide students with the skills they need to secure a good job - that has to change, he said. Naming the first 52 colleges and providers where young people will be able to study the first T levels is an important step forward, and we will continue the work with business and the education sector so everyone can benefit from these vital reforms.The locations are spread across the country and include further education colleges, schools, community colleges and training centres. The West Midlands is the region with the highest number of centres, with ten providers including University College Birmingham, City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College and Bordesley Green Girls’ School \u0026amp Sixth Form signed up to the scheme. In Yorkshire and the Humber schools including Barnsley College, York College and Notre Dame Catholic Sixth Form College are set to provide the qualification.Six schools and colleges in London are signed up, as well as four in the north east of England, five in the north west and nine in the south east. The east of the country has the fewest providers, with just one centre, Derby College in the East Midlands, and three in the East of England. The courses will include three month industry placements and a curriculum designed by employers.Earlier this week the Institute for Apprenticeships announced the draft content for the first three qualifications, and asked for feedback from further education providers by June 4. Which A-levels to take for the most popular degreesThe construction course will focus on design, surveying and planning, with modules covering topics including health and safety law, environmental performance, the internet of things and team management. The digital course will cover production, design and development, including topics such as internet security, data management, and the ethical issues raised by an increasing reliance on technology. On the education and childcare course students will learn about child development, ersity legislation, child language acquisition, and how to work with parents.  The courses were initially supposed to be launched by 2019 but last summer skills minister Anne Milton announced that the timetable had been delayed by a year.Commenting on the announcement, the Prime Minister said: Everyone should be able to have access to an education that suits them, but we know that for those that don’t choose to go to university, the routes into further technical and vocational training can be hard to navigate.  That’s why we’re making the most significant reform to advanced technical education in 70 years to ensure young people have gold standard qualifications open to them whichever route they choose. T-levels provide a high-quality, technical alternative to A-levels ensuring thousands of people across the country have the skills we need to compete globally – a vital part of our modern industrial strategy.Department for EducationJacob Rees-Mogg: NI abortion law is \u0026#39an issue of devolution\u0026#39Photo Dispatch: Death of the American motorcycle - and the search for next generation of riders\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 delivers up to 20,000 lightning strikes – as Stansted fuel system hitFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Guitar maker Fender among firms raided in price-fix probeComment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herMutiny Festival cancelled after two people die amid warnings of \u0026#39high strength or bad batch\u0026#39 substancesKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideFear over \u0026#39secret\u0026#39 Government plan for UK to stay in EU after deadline as cash set aside for European electionsComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

It adds that inquiries “relate to alleged anti-competitive agreements andor concerted practices in relation to musical instruments and equipment”, adding that it is focusing on “suspected anti-competitive agreements”.The investigations all began in April, when CMA officers arrived unannounced at the five offices. Its officers can enter a business without needing a warrant and demand documents.However, the CMA stresses that the investigations are “at an early stage and no assumptions should be made that competition law has been infringed”.UK offices of Fender, the American guitar manufacturer, have been visited by Companies and Markets AuthorityFender has been a household name since its iconic Stratocaster was the instrument of choice for guitar heroes including Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, David Gilmour and Eric Clapton. The instrument was designed in the US in 1954 by Leo Fender.Yamaha, established in 1887, produces high end electric guitars, pianos, synthesizers, drums and stringed instruments.Roland makes keyboards used by top musicians including the Brockett Parsons who performs with Lady Gaga. Korg is also a famous keyboard manufacturer with the likes of British pianist Rick Wakeman, who played with Yes, and Gary Barlow, from Take That, using their gear.While it is not clear what triggered the investigations, one music industry insider said it may be linked to a complaint from Germany.David Gilmour with his Fender Telecaster guitarThe inquiry is thought to be focusing on whether any attempt has been made to manipulate sales of musical instruments and pro-audio equipment with, among other things, price fixing or controlled sales to specific areas of the country.A music industry source said as many as 10 CMA staff visited the offices of the music manufacturers, some carrying out searches for up to four days. Meanwhile, 14 leading music shops have been asked to provide details of their dealings with the companies. The shops are not under any suspicion of wrongdoing.The sale of musical instruments and sheet music in online and from shops is worth around £500 million a year in Britain.A CMA spokeswoman said: “We are in the initial, informal evidence gathering stage of five investigations in the musical instrument sector.”After the initial “information gathering” operation, the CMA will decide whether to open a formal investigation.Spokespeople for the UK operations of Fender, Yamaha, Roland and Korg refused to comment. Casio failed to respond to repeated telephone calls and emails.In response to the inquiry the Music Industries Association (MIA), the UK trade body for the musical instrument industry, reissued advice explaining the intricacies of competition law.It advises both suppliers and retailers not to agree with one another to sell an instruments at a set price or denote specific geographical areas as exclusive to one store.The article warns that the CMA can carry out “dawn raids” on businesses it suspects may have rigged the market, adding that staff should not shred any documents.“Any business, regardless of its size, could be under suspicion, and subject to a dawn raid. All staff should cooperate with the lawful requests of the investigators (not doing so is an offence in itself),” it says.It warns that breaking competition laws can see companies fined up to 10 percent of their global turnover, prison terms of up to five years and company directors being disqualified for up to 15 years.Paul McManus, chief executive of the MIA, said: “As the trade body for the UK musical instrument industry we have naturally offered all possible support and help to the CMA in their investigation.“We are a very small part of the overall music industry and we are concerned that we have warranted this investigation.”Jacob Rees-Mogg: NI abortion law is \u0026#39an issue of devolution\u0026#39Photo Dispatch: Death of the American motorcycle - and the search for next generation of riders\u0026#39Mother of all thunderstorms\u0026#39 delivers up to 20,000 lightning strikes – as Stansted fuel system hitFlorence Pugh interview: ‘In America, they look at people’s bodies in \u2028a very different way’Comment: Millennials are stuck in endless childhood – but it\u0026#39s a mistake to think we like itComment: Unravelling the real story behind the Grenfell tragedy should be tackled now, not in NovemberParachute fall wife refuses to believe sergeant husband Emile Cilliers tried to kill herMutiny Festival cancelled after two people die amid warnings of \u0026#39high strength or bad batch\u0026#39 substancesKim Jong-un commits to Trump summit and denuclearisation, Moon says after surprise meetingAlan Bean, former Apollo 12 astronaut and fourth person to walk on moon, diesKim Jong-un has \u0026#39fixed will\u0026#39 to meet Trump after surprise summit with President Moon Jae-inSchools to let students study technical qualifications instead of A-levelsComment: Success at Oxford is about work ethic, not backgroundCalls for Ulster law reform after Irish abortion vote landslideFear over \u0026#39secret\u0026#39 Government plan for UK to stay in EU after deadline as cash set aside for European electionsComment: Our National Parks are a magnificent asset that needs protecting.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation.” The review is to be led by Julian Glover, the former  journalist and chief speechwriter to the previous prime minister David Cameron. “Our protected landscapes are England’s finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them,” said Mr Glover.“The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can’t wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England’s landscapes beautiful, erse and successful.” Defra said the review will not consider weakening or undermining the current scope of the National Parks or their existing protections.“Undertaking a review is one of the key commitments of the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan, which outlines our vision for improving the environment over a generation by connecting people with nature and helping wildlife to thrive,” it said.The review was welcomed by both National Parks England and the National Association of AONBs.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesRory Mcilroy has taken the clubhouse lead in round two of the BMW PGA championship at Wentworth.Alastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

Civil liberties campaigners called on Sainsbury’s to ditch the surveillance screens, which were branded a “gross intrusion” of privacy and a “blatant attempt to intimidate customers”. One Sainsbury’s regular, who did not want to be named, told The Independent she had been a customer for decades but was “shocked” to find herself being filmed while purchasing her groceries at a branch in central London. “Not only does it feel like there is mistrust and that you are potentially guilty of something, but there’s also the fear they will be storing your data.” She added: “I shan’t be using their self-service machines ever again. I felt violated.”Sainsbury’s CEO sings ‘We’re in the Money’ before ITV News segment about £12bn merger with AsdaAnother shopper, Alex Durham, said he encountered the screens at an outlet in Fitzrovia, London. The 27-year-old filmmaker said: “It struck me as bizarre really. I don’t want to seem all tinfoil hat, but it just seemed a little bit Orwellian. “It’s a bit bizarre just to be looking at your face while you’re doing something, because it really feels like someone is over your shoulder while you’re just getting a packet of crisps and a coke.“It just felt a little bit strange.”After asking Sainsbury’s about the cameras, he was told they were to help “facilitate a better customer journey”. Other customers complained on social media to the supermarket. One said a screen “clearly” showed the pin machine, while another posted an image showing a Sainsbury’s monitor displaying a keypad. I took a photo this morning and you can clearly see the pin machine and keypad. I’ll be boycotting this store and any other store that has these screens. It’s insane. pic.twitterQqE2PINOsO“What’s up with recording customers entering their PINs at the self-checkout?” Gabriel Currie asked. One Twitter user said the CCTV meant you could see down my top and this image was displayed on the screen.Complaining to Sainsbury’s, Chloe Heatlie said: “It’s pretty creepy to be frank with you. Certainly didn’t benefit my customer experience.”Multiple social media users vowed to boycott the machines, and even Sainsbury’s itself, until the screens were removed.A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said the cameras were part of a “security measure” to increase safety at its stores. UK news in picturesUK news in picturesRory Mcilroy has taken the clubhouse lead in round two of the BMW PGA championship at Wentworth.Alastair Cook batting against Pakistan during the first test match of the summer at Lord’s cricket ground, London.

The screens act as a deterrent to customers by making them more aware they are being watched.Silkie Carlo, director of civil liberties watchdog Big Brother Watch, said: “Sainsbury’s new self-surveillance screens are a gross intrusion of shoppers’ privacy, broadcasting the contents of our wallets and baskets. “These new cameras are a blatant attempt to intimidate customers and make us feel more closely watched than ever.“It is absolutely disgusting for Sainsbury’s to treat its loyal customers like criminals, especially as it is now nigh on impossible to get a human checkout. Big Brother Watch calls on Sainsbury’s to remove these surveillance screens urgently.”Sainsbury’s said it had installed the cameras at more than 300 stores, but refused to say if they would be rolled out to its remaining 1,100 outlets or whether the monitors were proving an effective deterrent.The supermarket said footage from its self-facing cameras, some of which were installed last year, were kept for 31 days before being overridden. According to a recent study, £3.2bn worth of goods is stolen from UK self-service tills every year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Brussels’ decision to kick the UK out of the scheme was angrily denounced by ministers, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, vowing to launch a separate satellite initiative if the EU refuses to back down.Tensions were already running high following days of strained negotiations in Brussels, during which one senior EU source described the UK’s demands as “fantasy”. Mr Hammond dismissed that remark as “not helpful”.Speaking at a legal conference in Lisbon, Mr Barnier noted the importance of agreeing how the relationship between the UK and the EU will be governed once Britain leaves the bloc.He said: “We have probably made a lot of progress on the substance of the withdrawal agreement, but without effective governance, these gains will be of limited value.“Because without agreement on governance, and without an agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.“The United Kingdom is well aware that our citizens and businesses, on both sides of the Channel, need legal certainty.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Hinting at continued frustration in Brussels over a perceived lack of detail in the UK’s negotiating demands, Mr Barnier urged ministers to be more “realistic” and warned them against playing a ‘blame game” with the EU.He said: “We also want an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom in the long term. But to achieve this, we need realistic proposals from the UK – proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.”He added: “For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It’s its decision. Not ours. And that has consequences.“The United Kingdom must look at the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.”Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe EU and the UK are at loggerheads over how disputes will be settled after Brexit. Britain wants to establish a joint committee, with members appointed by political leaders, to resolve any issues that arise, but European leaders have insisted the ECJ must be given the final say.Ms May has previously insisted: “The jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end.”In a sign of the continued distance between the two negotiating teams, Mr Barnier said: “We cannot accept that a jurisdiction other that the Court of Justice of the European Union determines the law and imposes its interpretation on the institutions of the Union.”The former French minister said the EU was open to the UK changing its stance, but that time was running out.He said: “If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it must tell us. The sooner the better.“We are asking for clarity. A negotiation cannot be a game of hide and seek.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Surgeons inserted a small electrical device similar to a pacemaker, called a vagus nerve stimulator, in her chest and wired it to a second device in her brain.When triggered by a magnet she wears on her wrist, it sends electrical impulses to her brain.An electric shock at the early sign of a seizure either stops or cuts the impact of a seizure. April said: The only downside is it hurts but it\u0027s a small price to pay to have my life back.April was diagnosed with epilepsy at 12. She said: It affected my confidence so much. I couldn\u0027t talk to people as I feared having a fit. When I got older I couldn\u0027t be left alone so I couldn\u0027t even date.I needed 24-hour care which was tough on my family and me. I was told I would never be able to drive or swim in case I had a fit.April competed in Miss Teen Great Britain in a bid to boost her confidence. She said: It also helped me to raise awareness of epilepsy.After reading about vagus nerve simulation she begged her doctor to refer her for the operation only available in extreme cases.She said: I was frightened the first time I shocked myself but I was astonished when it worked and prevented a seizure.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our jails are violent, drug-infested cesspits breeding hopelessness.Lags emerge with no prospects into unemployment, then drift back into crime in a dismal cycle costing billions.What a difference, though, when a store chain like Timpson takes a chance on ex-cons and gives them a new start.But Justice Secretary David Gauke MUST ensure watertight vetting.If just one sex predator or thug reoffends on day release, the idea will fall apart.HOW come vast numbers of migrants still flock to a Britain which supposedly became racist overnight on June 23, 2016?Did the 200,000 net new arrivals last year not get the Remoaners’ memo?Or is the reality different?Yes, Britain voted to control its borders, like any nation beyond the EU.But we are still the most welcoming country on Earth.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.It is two feet from our front window and front door - its like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.Now exasperated Thomas and his wife, who married in July, say they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: Were not even sure we want to live here now.Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it wont come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, have considered employing their own solicitor.Thomas added: At first I was tearful but now Im angry.We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now theyve gone.We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.We understand planning enforcement action is being taken against the neighbouring landowner to address the fence, which has been erected illegally and in breach of planning regulations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409153648.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bee manchester tree hope symbol bombing anniversary","story":"The city planted a trail of 28 Japanese maple trees to mark the first anniversary of the atrocity that shook the city to its core.In a poignant symbol, a swarm of honey bees has now descended on one of the trees close to the National Football Museum.The worker bee became a symbol of unity and defiance in the wake of the May 22 2017 attack and has come to represent Manchester’s indomitable spirit.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, a passer-by who witnessed the swarm descend on the tree said: “It’s brilliantly poignant.“The whole tree was just infested with bees and it had to be sealed off.“I don’t know whether a nest has been set up within the tree, or it’s a swarm following a queen and could leave, but it’s a lovely symbol.”To safeguard the bees, and protect the public, council workers have set up a cordon around the tree with a sign placed nearby saying: “Caution bees. Do not enter.”Dozens of moving notes of remembrance written by the public were attached to the branches last week as part of a memorial service to the 22 victims.Photographs suggest the hive has been set up on a branch near a message reading: “We will never forget. X.”The Trees of Hope line a route from Manchester Victoria railway station to St Ann’s Square, and were installed for members of the public to share messages of tribute, solidarity and love.Some of the trees have been nurtured with compost made from the floral tributes left by the public at the site of the attack last year.The trail will come to an end today.After this, each message tag will be preserved and kept, alongside tributes left last year, in an archive of the city’s response to the attack.The trees will continue to stand in the city centre.The worker bee has been the symbol of Manchester since the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th century.In the 1800s Manchester was awash with textile mills that were commonly described as ‘hives of activity’ and the workers inside them compared to bees.‘Busy bee’ is still a term associated with industriousness and hard work.Traditionally, they represent the city’s energy and sense of community.Worker bees are featured in Manchester’s coat of arms, which was given to the city in 1842, and can be seen on many public buildings throughout the city.Following the Manchester Arena bombing, the worker bee became a symbol of unity and defiance, and came to represent Manchester’s indomitable spirit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408258651.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fat brits should be more like mick jagger you dont see a 20st rolling stone","story":"Jamie Oliver is usually wheeled out for some well-intentioned finger-wagging whenever there is another bout of hand-wringing about our nation’s ever-expanding waistline.But Mick, 74, has a 28in waistline.And Jamie Oliver has not had a 28in waistline since he was 12.Government ministers should be begging Jagger to come to Downing Street to learn all he knows about nutrition and exercise.The media should be quizzing Mick for his reflections on current levels of sugar in biscuits and chocolate.And all of us should be looking at Mick and marvelling at how fit an elderly gent can be.I saw the Rolling Stones perform twice this week at the London Stadium and Jagger was a leaping, bounding, skipping, run-ning, jumping, jaw-dropping revelation.And fuelled by nothing stronger than a bowl of pasta, he kept it up for two hours.We learned this week that half the country will be dangerously overweight by 2045. Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

Several passengers tweeted their frustration at being told to board planes, only to then sit on the craft for hours without take-off.One passenger, Lorraine Townley, said: \"@Ryanair if you know that you have no access to fuel and all flights from Stansted are delayed why make us board the plane to sit on here for hours waiting for you to fix the issue? It\u0027s boiling hot and we aren\u0027t even being given free water. Making more money off us!\" Emily Morgan told Sky News her flight to Ibiza with Ryanair, scheduled to depart at 8.45am, was still on the tarmac at 10.15am and said she did not get much information.She said: \"We were due to take off at 8:45 but no information on when we will be refilled. The plane next to us was due to take off at 6:05 but is still sat there.\"People are really cross that there was no information or warning of the delays at the airport and we were allowed to board knowing there was 3 hour plus delays.\"The bar has been opened but been offered nothing complimentary.\" Twitter user Lozza shared a picture of scores of people waiting in the airport for information, and claimed she had been told nothing about what was going on.She said: \"No one about to offer updates, hundreds of us huddled together in departures, airport is boiling hot and looking at a minimum 3 hour delay. I think you owe us these pints.\" Tom Lewis wrote: \"@Ryanair hey there pals! Can we expect any info on our 9am flight to Athens from Stansted anytime soon? The North Korea-esque info blackout isn\u0027t fun.\"Vic Goddard said she was entering her fourth hour of delays and claimed Ryanair was selling snacks instead of giving out information.According to Which?, passengers are entitled to refreshments appropriate to the delay after two hours. The company suggests keeping any receipts for expenses at the airport if refreshments are not offered, and then claiming back from the airline.Compensation should increase for delays of three hours or more, and once the five hour mark is hit, passengers should be given an option to fly by a different route. This does depend on whether there were \"extraordinary circumstances\", which weather comes into. Jet2 passengers are reporting being given up to \u0026#16320 credit on their boarding passes as they wait in the airport.Chloe Goulding told Sky News she had been given \u0026#836410 onto her boarding pass at Ibiza Airport, and needed to use it all in one go.

Lightening strike or union strike ? Rick Astley is playing on loop... please help me.\"He then added: \"@jet2tweets hats off to the staff on the delayed Croatia flight, handing out water and letting families in the cockpit. #Stansted #stillnofuel.\" Blogger Cathy Winston tweeted to say her 6.45am flight to Talinn was awaiting a fuel truck until 9.30am, and she hoped to reach her destination before lunch.One passenger said her 5.55am flight was delayed until at least 3.10pm.

Today, its occupant is a Russian oligarch, a man worth upwards of $11 billion.Mr Abramovich bought the chateau in 2001, two years before he secured a major foothold in the UK, buying Chelsea Football club.As the first Russian oligarch in London, he turned the club around and built up an empire in the British capital.It now includes his Kensington mansion and a Russian Steel firm, Evraz, which is headquartered in London and, this year, has been the best performing FTSE 100 company, gaining 42%.A public footpath runs along one of the chateau\u0027s perimeter walls. As we walk along, the cameras move and follow us. For someone who values his privacy, it\u0027s a wonderful spot.Moored off shore is his boat, the Eclipse: registered in Bermuda, with a crew of 70, a helipad, a mini submarine.It is staggeringly large.Beyond it is another yacht, a little smaller, but still huge. This was Mr Abramovich\u0027s too, until he lost a bet and handed it over to a mate.We approach the Eclipse and politely call out to the staff on board.As an attempt to find and speak to a Russian billionaire about his visa issues, this was always likely to be futile. And so it was.Our first introductions were met with a clear \"no\".But on the radio from our boat to the bridge of the Eclipse we managed a brief convention.Could we find out, I ask somewhat foolishly, whether Mr Abramovich is aboard and able to speak to us.\"That\u0027s all well received, Sir. At this moment in time we are unable to comment on the location of any guests. That\u0027s unable to comment. Thank you.\" Obviously he wasn\u0027t going to speak to us, but a little bit of his empire up close is a useful hint of the life of an oligarch.So what\u0027s the British government\u0027s apparent issue? Russian man gets rich, enjoys life, invests in London plenty have.Why, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said this week, will the UK \"continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin?\"On the specifics of Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issue, the UK government has not commented.Sources close to him, quoted in the Russian media, say there isn\u0027t a problem, just a delay.Mr Gould-Davies was serving in the British Embassy in Moscow when KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London.He has watched Russian behaviour in Crimea, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and, most recently, the Salisbury attack.\"Russian and other wealth in the UK has long been an ethical concern, but we have a dramatic new concern in particular since the events in Salisbury,\" he said.\"Russia is presenting a more aggressive threat to the United Kingdom and other Western European countries than it has at any time since the Cold War period.\"Now the Russian state, the Putin regime, depends upon elite networks of power and influence and wealth.\"So the Russian State is on the one hand presenting a threat on the other hand it\u0027s been sustained and supported by elites who make use of the UK\u0027s financial services to keep their wealth safe.\"That cannot be right.\"On the same day that Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issues emerged, the British government\u0027s foreign affairs select committee published \"Moscow\u0027s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK\", a report which recommended that the government cracked down on Russian wealth in the UK.It is something that American banker and author Bill Browder has been calling for ever since he accused the Kremlin of murdering his lawyer. Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009.He had represented Mr Browder, who had been accused of tax fraud by the Kremlin.He lobbied the US congress to introduce the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights abuses with sanctions.He has called for the same in Europe and the UK.\"The US has made a very complete list. They made a list of 200 oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. I think you could operate off of that list and the US sanctioned seven of those individuals. I think the UK as a first step should sanction the same individuals that the US has sanctioned,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich is not among those sanctioned in the US and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.But Mr Browder says all oligarchs close to the Russian president should be targeted.\"Most oligarchs did the deal with Putin and effectively became his business partner.\"And so when you hear about an oligarch worth $13 or $14 billion, probably $7 [billion] of that is Vladimir Putin\u0027s. \"And so, if you want to go after Vladimir Putin, you go after the oligarchs,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich\u0027s proximity to Putin goes back years.Well before he acquired Chelsea, he was one of Russia\u0027s most influential businessmen.He was close to Mr Putin\u0027s predecessor Boris Yeltsin he helped Mr Putin rise and he benefited from it.Mr Browder welcomed the decision this week to pass into law the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which includes the \"Magnitsky amendment\" allowing the British government to freeze the assets and ban the visas of human rights violators from Russia and elsewhere.\"That\u0027s an absolutely powerful tool that can be used and should be used aggressively against these Russian oligarchs,\" he says."},{"url":null,"title":"best cycling routes uk families","story":"AdvertorialUK’s best bank holiday bike routes for families revealed – plus the things all cyclists need to packWhy not pack up the bikes - and a sandwich or two - and head out on a group adventure?\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:21, 25 MAY 2018Updated12:56, 26 MAY 2018AdvertorialThere are so many rides to choose from\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLife doesn’t get much better than spending the bank holiday weekend cycling around some of the UK’s most beautiful spots with your loved ones. \u2028Considering where to go and in need of inspiration? We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

MPs want the Prime Minister to decide where her loyalties lie after Ireland voted for reform - while Northern Ireland retains some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. Only women whose lives or serious health are at risk can get abortions in Northern Ireland, forcing thousands to travel desperately across the Irish Sea each year. Several prominent Tories including the Equalities Minister have now renewed demands that women in Northern Ireland win the right to abortion. Another minister has broken ranks today to call for a free vote on the issue - where MPs are not whipped by party - in parliament. Tory education minister Anne Milton added: I feel quite strongly about it. I think it should be a free vote. Yet Downing Street refused to comment on the calls today and Mrs May\u0027s only response was to praise Ireland\u0027s impressive show of democracy.  Ms Milton told ITV\u0027s Peston on Sunday the situation for Northern Ireland women is anomalous and doesn\u0027t feel quite right. She suggested she would vote to change the law if a vote was held, adding: I would have to see the detail of the amendment, but I believe in a woman’s right to choose. Women and equalities minister Penny Mordaunt said the referendum signalled a historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland. That hope must be met, she demanded. And Tory Nicky Morgan and three other former holders of the equalities job - Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Maria Miller - all backed Ms Mordaunt. More than 140 MPs are now said to be prepared to back an amendment to the domestic violence bill, coordinated by Labour MP Stella Creasy, to allow abortions in Ulster. That could be the vehicle that allows MPs to hold a historic vote in Westminster. Ms Creasy urged MPs: Make sure we don’t leave Northern Irish women behind.  It comes after voters in Ireland axed the country\u0027s hardline abortion ban by repealing the Eighth Amendment in a historic referendum result. The Yes camp won 66% of the vote, 706,349 ahead of the No camp, after thousands of women flew home to vote from as far as Asia and Argentina. Yet Northern Ireland\u0027s abortion ban remains, separate to both the Republic and the rest of the UK. Theresa May has already compromised under pressure, and offered free abortions to women who make the trip across the Irish Sea. But her MPs say she should go further and stop those trips from being needed at all. Tory former Cabinet minister Justine Greening said: A similar debate needs to happen in Northern Ireland.  It forces Prime Minister Mrs May into a political nightmare because she relies on the hardline, right-wing Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to prop up her regime. The Tories gave more than \u0026pound1billion to Northern Ireland to win the support of the DUP\u0027s 10 MPs on key votes in Parliament. And last night the DUP\u0027s Ian Paisley made clear the strength of opposition Mrs May would face. He warned Northern Ireland should not be bullied into accepting abortion on demand. The settled will of the people has been to afford protections to the unborn life and protect the life of the mother, he added.

The Tory MP owns almost a fifth of Somerset Capital Management, which he founded and which now manages almost \u0026pound7.5billion for wealthy investors. On behalf of its clients, SCM has bought shares in two Russian firms blacklisted by the US which are controlled by powerful oligarchs in Vladimir Putin\u0027s inner circle. Its Russian assets are worth \u0026pound217million, according to the latest valuation by City data sources. The revelation came after he slammed Moscow in the wake of the Salisbury nerve agent attack and urged Theresa May to impose a freeze on Russian assets in Britain. Quizzed about the hypocrisy with regard to his firm\u0027s Russian links on BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show today, Mr Rees-Mogg said SCM would be open to legal action if it based its business on his “political opinions”.  He said: “Somerset Management is an emerging markets investment management company. We manage clients’ money - it\u0027s not our own money, it\u0027s clients’ money.” The Brexiteer MP added: You\u0027re assuming I make money from these investments. I don\u0027t. These aren\u0027t my investments. “Our job is to invest in emerging markets for our clients using their money. We have to do that as well as we can under the law. “We would be opening ourselves up to legal actions if we decided that my political opinions should influence the investments. That would be quite improper. There is no suggestion Somerset Capital Management or Mr Rees-Mogg have done anything illegal.  Mr Rees-Mogg denied directly making cash from the investments in Russian firms but admitted he could benefit by second degree as a part-owner of SCM. He added: We can’t run our investments on my political opinions. I think we should be much tougher on Russia. I think we should impose the level of sanctions that America has imposed on Russia. Meanwhile, he also heaped pressure on Theresa May over Brexit. He urged the Prime Minister to take a tougher line with Brussels after making errors in her Brexit negotiation strategy. The chairman of the influential European Research Group, tipped as a potential future Tory leader, insisted there was no menace in me at all over his actions. But he claimed the Government had proposed over-complicated solutions to the customs problem and must be prepared to tell Brussels it will walk away without paying the almost \u0026pound40 billion Brexit divorce bill.

The year was 1971 and 25-year-old Dina had just been hospitalised following a mental breakdown. Over the previous weeks, Dina had been suffering with depression and delusions that she was an FBI target It had been a difficult few months for Dina. Originally from New York, she’d moved to England to work in a hospital, but she’d struggled to feel at home in Britain. She missed her family and friends dreadfully, and felt incredibly isolated, despite a serious relationship with her partner Yannis, a Greek journalist in exile. But mainly, she was working too hard, juggling lecturing in psychology, writing a book, seeing therapy clients and studying for a PhD. ‘One of my theories about having the breakdown is what I call too much work, not enough love,’ she says. ‘I knew I was slipping into a breakdown, I could feel it. My biggest fear was winding up in a back ward of some hospital, just having to watch TV all day.’  Her paranoid fantasies became stronger by the day. Dina was convinced she was an FBI target, and that some people were trying to poison her. The turning point came one day when she was walking through North London and had the sudden realisation she didn’t know what era she was in. ‘There was a fashion at that time for long dresses and also mini-skirts, and the contrast confused me – suddenly I couldn’t tell which century I was in. I stopped at a bakery to buy some biscuits but I wasn’t sure I had the right money because I didn’t know what the currency should be. It was a terrible confusion, and I walked home in the pouring rain. When I got home Yannis thought I looked completely drowned and warped, and that’s when he called the doctors to hospitalise me.’ But when Dina arrived at Middlesex Hospital, she felt certain the doctors were FBI agents trying to arrest her and fought them as much as she could. Eventually, they succeeded in admitting her to the psychiatric unit, where she would spend several months.  ‘I saw a note on the floor and in my mind it was a clue to follow,’ she recalls. ‘I was following all these “clues” and I got to the roof of the hospital and I thought, “I’m supposed to jump off.” But when I was imagining my body in bits on the ground, I couldn’t bear it so I ran the other way. I remember my heart beating very loudly, and when I got back to the ward the nurses took one look at me and realised they’d better keep an eye on me.’ Dina was sure she was going to die, and began to make preparations, even requesting to see the rabbi. ‘I felt completely hopeless, and just couldn’t see a future for myself,’ she explains. ‘Whatever breakdown you’re having, the tendency is to feel like you’re nothing and you’re no-one, especially if you can no longer do the things you used to do.’ The care she received was lacking in many ways, and Dina struggled with a lot of the staff at the hospital. But the patients formed a tight bond, and it was this camaraderie that made her begin to feel more human again. Some other patients began to confide in her about their problems, saying they trusted her opinion above those of their psychiatrists. ‘That was when I began to feel I was being valued, and realised I’m not just nothing – maybe I could come out of this and do some good by helping other people,’ she remembers. Turning point  After three months in hospital, Dina was ready to come home. ‘Slowly my mind began to understand things and see what was going on. It was a slow but happy process,’ she explains. ‘I felt great, like it was going to be spring forever because I wasn’t going to be in a mental hospital for the rest of my life.’ Piece by piece, Dina began to rebuild her life. She finished her PhD, got married and had two children, Ari and Chloe. The breakdown, in many ways, had been the first step to the rest of her life. ‘I always refer to that period as my “madness” as truly that is how I felt. It’s a word that’s so vivid and one that we fear so much,’ she says. ‘If you have the opportunity to come back in a positive way, which I did, you end up in a whole new place. That’s certainly true for me and I felt that having the breakdown was a positive experience.’ Dina channeled the energy from her new lease of life, penning a book to help others come back from the brink. She also co-founded a holiday company with Yannis, aimed at helping independent travellers have creative breaks where they can study things like art, writing, personal development or music in a beautiful setting. ‘I was inspired by the idea of community, in part the one I’d seen in hospital. I wanted to create that community atmosphere for my holiday makers with people they’d never met before, a safe place where people could open up and laugh more than they have since when they were a child.’ Positive change "},{"url":null,"title":"duke kent advertising new private","story":"NewsThe Duke of Kent is advertising for a new private secretary - and the perks are greatThe first cousin to the Queen requires the perfect candidate to join the \"small team\" at St James\u0027s Palace and to accompany him and Duchess of Kent on visits in the UK and abroad\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySarah LawrenceDanya BazaraaNews Reporter23:24, 26 MAY 2018NewsThe Duke of Kent is searching for a new private secretary (file photo) (Image: Joe Giddens/PA Wire)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duke of Kent is advertising for a new private secretary to join his Royal team - and the perks look great.

The local Holyhead Coastguard were called at around 2pm to reports of the incident, but they could not do anything to prevent the boat sinking around three hours later, the Daily Post reports .

The spokesman added: “A very quick decision was made by the coxswain that the situation was too dangerous to try and put any crew on board the stricken vessel. “Within half an hour, the vessel had sunk further into the sea, and at 4.20pm she sank completely into the 50-metre deep waters.” "},{"url":null,"title":"least four ex royal marines","story":"NewsAt least four ex-Royal Marines suspected to have killed themselves in past four weeks in new PTSD scandalThe former Commandos are understood to have been veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan war zones who were ­suffering with their mental health\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySean Rayment22:20, 26 MAY 2018Updated08:17, 27 MAY 2018NewsThe spate of deaths – described as “carnage” – is understood to have caused “grave concern” at the very highest levels of the tight-knit Marines (file picture) (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAt least four former Royal Marines are suspected to have committed suicide in the past four weeks in a new PTSD \u0026shyscandal, we can reveal.

The spate of deaths – described as “carnage” – came as it also emerged that a further three former soldiers are feared to have taken their own lives since the beginning of April. It is understood to have caused “grave concern” at the very highest levels of the tight-knit Marines, whose proud traditions date back 350 years.  Maj Gen Charles Stickland, who as Commandant General is head of the elite corps, is said to have expressed deep concern over the deaths. And Prince Harry, who served in Afghanistan with the Army but now holds the ceremonial post of the Marines’ Captain General, has also voiced his worries. Harry recently said that both he and new bride Meghan were “shocked to the core” by stories from veterans struggling with mental health issues. He said previously: “I have seen those I have served with suffer, struggling to seek out help they desperately need.  “And we know there are more just like them who suffer in silence.” A veteran of 20 years in the Marines who was friends with one suicide victim \u0026shydescribed the recent surge in deaths as \u0026shy“utter carnage”.

Dehenna Davison, 24, is originally from Sheffield but went to Hull University to study British politics and legislative studies. She joined the Conservative Party and it was there that Dehenna, also known as Dee, met 59-year-old Hull councillor John Fareham. John, a Conservative councillor for Hull’s Bricknell ward, said: “People say where have you been all my life, well, Dee wasn\u0027t born for three-quarters of mine. I asked her for a coffee and, when she still hadn\u0027t got back to me four months later, I asked her again.  In 2012, Dehenna went on work placement in Parliament and John went to visit her, the Daily Mail reports. We went clubbing my style, to the Carlton, the Athenaeum and the Garrick, he said. Back in Hull, the couple\u0027s romance blossomed when Dee stood for the Conservatives in the Hull North seat and the pair were confronted by an angry voter while out campaigning. They announced their engagement in September 2015, when John decided to propose outside his old home in his home town of Bracknell in Berkshire. I had asked her before, but she told me to ask her properly, he said. At my age, going down on one knee was going to be a bit tricky. It wasn\u0027t the going down, it was the getting back up again.

Speedos won’t get you anywhere fast – they’re the UK’s most hated item of clothing. You may think squeezing yourself into the tiny, ultra-tight trunks will make you look like James Bond. But a new survey has revealed 69 per cent of Brits reckon those “budgie smugglers” should never be worn in public – and kept strictly for your eyes only. Nearly three quarters of the women polled – a whopping 74 per cent – gave Speedos the thumbs down. That is despite the best efforts of 007 sex god Daniel Craig, who made movie history when he rose out of the sea in Casino Royale wearing nothing but the skimpiest of ultra-tight trunks.  The problem might be that other famous faces, including aging nightclub owner Peter Stringfellow, 77, have also posed in the unforgiving swimwear that leaves very little to the imagination. It was designed in the 1960s to reduce drag, give support and provide freedom of movement for competitive swimmers. But Speedo admits its trunks are no longer the most popular swimwear for UK men, as many prefer looser fitting shorts. Only 13 per cent of the 3,277 people polled by YouGov actually admitted to liking budgie smugglers. Matthew Smith, of YouGov, said: “Our results show that some things really are better left to the imagination.  “No matter how ready men’s beach bodies are this summer, they might not make too many friends if they stride across the sand in a pair of Speedos.” Second most hated item of clothing in the poll was leather trousers – a favourite of rocker Rod Stewart – with 63 per cent of the votes. Crocs, the brightly coloured rubber shoes, came third with 59 per cent of the votes. Flares, as modelled by Loose Woman Melanie Brown, were fourth with 57 per cent. Clothes with elbow patches – as worn by Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean – were fifth in the poll with 54 per cent of votes. Tracksuits, a fashion staple of Socceraid supporter James Corden, came sixth with 52 per cent of votes.

Dr Anthony Miller, an advisor to the World Health Organisation, says pupils could suffer long-term effects from exposure to the radio waves. He warned: “Radiation from mobile phones and other wireless devices can cause changes in DNA and induce cancer in experimental animals. “Children’s skulls are thinner and absorb much more of this radiation. We ignore this at our future peril.” Campaigners claim an increasing number of people suffer from “electromagnetic sensitivity” – leading to symptoms from a lack of concentration to headaches and nosebleeds. In one disturbing case, a 15-year-old is said to have taken her own life after being overwhelmed by tiredness, dizzy spells and even itchy skin due to wifi networks at her school.  We also found children removed from class by their parents after they began to suffer nausea and concentration issues – and even a teacher who claims he was affected himself. Yet Public Health England insists wifi is safe as it uses similar frequencies to radio and TV and gives less exposure than mobiles. And that means NHS doctors currently have no diagnosis for the condition – leaving those fearing they suffer from it with nowhere to turn. Mum Debra Fry told how her daughter Jenny killed herself after developing the wifi “allergy”. The 15-year-old hanged herself from a tree following two years of crippling tiredness, headaches and even bladder problems. Debra, 57, said: “I believe she just couldn’t take any more. She had overwhelming fatigue, headaches and ear pressure, difficulty finding words, itchy skin, dizziness and stiff joints. “She was getting into trouble at school because she couldn’t concentrate and needed to urinate more than usual, so was always leaving class.  “She’d always been a very good student and a very healthy child. “I made sure she got the right nutrients, the right influences, the right education. I had no idea we were exposing her to something so dangerous.” While many of Jenny’s symptoms could be put down to teenage hormones, Debra and partner Charles Newman are in no doubt they were caused by the wireless networking technology. They say Jenny’s difficulties began when they and her school installed wifi at around the same time in late 2012. But she improved when they took out their home wifi router months later. Debra, of Chadlington, Oxon, said: “All her symptoms eased or went away when she came home, particularly at weekends and holidays. “We wanted to take her to the GP but thought our fears would be dismissed.” She told how Jenny then failed to show up at school one day in June 2015. She said: “She’d texted a friend, hinting at what she was going to do. But they’d left their phone at home. “When they realised something was wrong another friend came to tell me and we went out looking for her.”  Close to tears, Debra told how she saw her daughter in the distance, beside a tree. She said: “I thought she was standing on the bough of the hill. “I was calling out her name, asking if she was okay and reassuring her. “It was only as I got closer I realised she wasn’t standing at all and there was a noose around her neck.” Surveys have shown up to five per cent of people believe they are affected by sensitivity to radio waves. Experts are divided over whether the technology can actually cause harm. And even insurance firms play safe, with some refusing outright to cover schools against claims for exposure. Lloyds of London syndicate CFC Underwriting excludes school liability for injuries “resulting from or contributed to by electromagnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetism, radio waves or noise.” Another firm, Zurich, will offer cover. But Tilden Watson, head of education products, said: “As with any insurance, we would consider the school’s specific involvement in use and supply of the technology.” The International Agency for Research on Cancer – a branch of the World Health Organization – classes wifi as a Group 2B cancer risk, meaning there is not yet enough evidence to dismiss a possible link.  Wifi is included because it uses similar technology to mobile phones. Public Health England says a year spent near to a wifi hotspot would give the same dose of radio waves as a 20-minute mobile call. Canadian Dr Miller believes WHO should increase the risk rating. He said: “We know that when humans are exposed to cancer-causing agents, it’s usually quite a delay before you see the full effect. We’re concerned when those children become adults their risk of cancer will be much greater. “We could be storing up higher cancer rates in the future. Since radio frequency radiation was graded 2B there have been more studies showing this increased risk. “In my view it should be on the same level as tobacco and asbestos. It should not be allowed in school.”  Schools in France, Belgium and parts of America already ban or limit wifi use. And campaigners are urging the UK to follow suit until more research is carried out. Mum-of-three Alisa Keane has taken her three sons out of school because she believes the wifi was making them ill. Alisa, of Downpatrick, Co Down, said James, nine, Conn, seven, and six-year-old Dara suffered headaches, nausea and concentration issues. She is now home schooling them after seeing how the “fog” lifted away from the classroom.  And in Doncaster, dad Paul Lewis removed daughter Jessica from her junior school into a private academy after she developed headaches when wifi was introduced in the classroom. Accountant Paul says Jessica, now 15, no longer suffers the mysterious symptoms. He said: “The frustrating thing is there is no need for school wifi. “They should be using cables until it can be proved there is no risk from electromagnetic fields.”  Sarah Dacre, a trustee of charity Electrosensitivity UK, says they help “hundreds” of people with symptoms including tinnitus , skin rashes, muscle pains and memory loss.   She said: “There are clinics overseas which regularly diagnose ES with a range of tests. “But there are no such places in the UK and most GPs have no training in handling it. “New ES cases often tell us they’re unable to use smartphones or wifi routers, and that installation of smart meters has made their lives impossible.” Diana Hanson, of the Safe School Information Technology Alliance, says parents convinced wifi is making their children sick are often “extremely distressed”. She said: “People say the risk is minimal by comparing it to things on the Group 2B list such as coffee and exhaust fumes. “But we don’t give our children 10 coffees a day or sit them in a room full of running cars.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0537567e08a-918x564.jpg ","title":"burton albion lead chase for gifted dundee united playmaker scott fraser","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlaymaker Scott Fraser looks set for a switch to England after announcing he’s quitting Dundee United.Burton Albion, looking to rebuild after relegation from the Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west coast, could be set for a return to Tannadice as part of the shake-up to the youth set-up that’s taking place this summer.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b07c93c9b9b5-e1527253316470.jpg ","title":"council apologise after staff lock dundee pensioner in cemetery","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pensioner was locked in a Dundee cemetery by council workers.John Stewart, 65, was returning to his Dryburgh flat from the city centre when he decided to enjoy the sun and wander around the city’s ancient Howff.After spending some time on a bench in the western end of the graveyard he got up to leave at around 6pm on Wednesday.However, the northern exit at Meadowside had been padlocked shut.A quick check of the other exit revealed it had also been locked.Mr Stewart said he could not find a number to call anywhere and considered phoning the emergency services.He said: “I had been inside since 3pm and I was just wandering around the gravestones, which I often do.“It was around 20 minutes from the moment I realised I was locked in until I was freed.“I would have thought the area should be checked before it was locked up.“I’m annoyed that I was trapped.”Mr Stewart eventually managed to grab the attention of a good Samaritan who called the chairman of the Dundee Howff Conservation Group, Simon Goulding.He said Mr Goulding told him it was the first time he had ever heard of someone being locked in the grounds.Mr Stewart added: “It was a shock.“I tried to climb over the spiked fence but it was too dangerous.“I had my shopping from Tesco and I was on my way home.

Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked.

Nicky has tremendous ability and in addition to scoring he is also very good at reading the game,” he said.The 26-year-old had the option of staying at Dunfermline, for whom he hit 37 goals in the past two seasons, but admitted the lure of a move to Tannadice was too much to resist.“I am delighted to be joining a club of the stature of Dundee United and my main intention is to help the team get us up to the Premiership.“I am really looking forward to this new challenge in my career,” he said.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee united boss front runner for morton job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer manager Ray McKinnon could be doing battle with Dundee United in the Championship next season – as boss of Morton.Word from the west today was the 47-year-old is now the clear front runner to replace ex-Dundee gaffer Jim Duffy at Cappielow.Duffy was dismissed within days of the ’Ton failing to make the play-offs at the end of the season and they’ve since been interviewing potential replacements.McKinnon is among them and looks set to be given the nod.He was dismissed by the Tangerines following a home defeat against Inverness Caley Thistle back in October.That left them down in fourth place in the division, five points off the top of the table.By the end of the campaign United were third, 13 points behind champions St Mirren.McKinnon took some time off following his departure but it’s known he is now keen to get back into management.He has been considering a number of offers, including some from abroad and the Morton job would be appealing.United, meanwhile, are continuing their revamp of the club on and off the park by advertising for a head of medicine and sports science.The holder of the newly created post will be responsible for injury prevention, management and rehabilitation.They will also be in charge of screening, nutrition and physical development within the playing squad.The club hope to have the new post filled by the start of the season.United’s new home kit for the 2018/19 season went on sale at the club shop at Tannadice today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

costs could soar to over 20m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of Dundee’s planned new stadium development could soar to well over £20 million due to access requirements.But while original estimates of the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone that will use the stadium, the associated commercial developments and the wider road network,” said a spokesman.“We’re working with the developer to get absolute clarity on their proposals and the

We have asked the developer’s consultant to carry out an appraisal of all available access options for the site.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

Inverness runs three after-school groups using state-of-the-art equipment and software at An Lochran House on the UHI campus.Club founder Robert Fraser said the club\u0027 Raspberry Jam group, which won the\u0026nbspchallenge, designed a programme to analyse the living conditions including temperature, movement and humidity on the ISS.The programme was also designed to take a picture of the earth and guess whether it was looking at land, water or cloud every 60 seconds for three hours.\"The space station travels over 17,000 miles per hour, so roughly equivalent of Inverness to Edinburgh and back again every minute,\" Mr Fraser said.\"I would be happy for a train that took a couple of hours!\"His 11-year-old son, Wojtek, who inspired the project is part of the Raspberry Jam group.\"We are all really excited to get the data back,\" Wojtek said.\"We all worked as part of a team and all worked on different parts, like the camera or the heat sensor.\"I worked on the pressure sensor and opening and closing files.\"When we get the information from the ISS I think it will be interesting to find out about the temperature.\"I wonder if the astronauts notice the slight changes to temperature.\"Archie Mackie (9) attends the club\u0027 introduction to coding session.\"I like how you can make your own stuff like movement and stories,\" Archie said.\"I also like to draw so I might make my own story.\"The club is run by volunteers and code enthusiasts including Daryl Titcomb.\"It\u0027 great for the kids to be creative and try new things,\" Mr Titcomb said.Equipment and unused computer gear has been donated to the club by supportive parents and Inverness College UHI while a recent donation from MacLeod and McCallum enabled new equipment to be bought.Budding coders or

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million). There\u0027 little that can be done to increase revenue from learning, which relies on Scottish Government grants.
