Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”With the government support package now in place – and extended until October – Blaikie has turned his attention to helping local people. Launching his Soup(er) Hero campaign in April, he is now making soup and sandwiches for those in need. With help from the community council, a community hub – where food is dropped off and distributed by local volunteers – was born. The feedback keeps him going. “There’s an older couple and the wife’s got cancer and every day they get their soup and sandwich,” he says. “They have the soup at 12 o’clock, then the man drives his wife to the hospital for her treatment and when they come back, they enjoy the sandwich. That’s what makes it worthwhile.”It’s not just people benefiting, either – residents of Edinburgh zoo are also tucking into the pub’s surplus wares. “I had a massive box of bananas left over and my mum said: ‘You should take this to the zoo.’ So I got hold of all my leftover fruit and knocked on the zoo door – and that’s been it ever since.” Now Blaikie’s weekly deliveries of fruit, vegetables and fish help to feed the animals at a time when visitors – the zoo’s main form of income – have come to a standstill. “You’d probably choose not to eat some of the bananas, for example, because they don’t look as good, but they’re perfectly fine for the animals. When we’re making sandwiches, not everybody likes the heels of the bread either, so I freeze them and take them along – nothing’s getting wasted. And if I see something for a good price at the wholesalers – apples, cabbages, broccoli - I’ll pick that up, too. We need to keep zoos going, they’re all under a lot of pressure.”While it’s difficult to ascertain when exactly businesses such as Blaikie’s will open again, for now, he is focusing on adapting the way they work to ensure business is possible. “We have an isolated table in the front vestibule area, so people can come in and collect food safely, using contactless on the card machines for takeaways. We have separate areas for drivers to sit in too, so we’re doing everything we can.” And plans are already afoot for when pubs are finally allowed to reopen. “I’m looking at adding an area to the outside, so people can sit there the whole year round and I’m hoping to put in a little microbrewerydistillery, so I could eventually make hand sanitiser further down the line.”Why focus on helping others when keeping his own business afloat requires such effort? “I believe in helping people. I know this virus is a horrible thing, but it’s bringing out a lot of good in people as well. Neighbours are looking after neighbours, people are helping others with shopping or taking dogs for a walk. For so long, I didn’t like the way the world was going ...”What does Blaikie hope will come out of this situation? He pauses, then says: “That people start to work together a bit more, being more thoughtful of what’s going on around them. And of course, that they come to the Mercat for a meal.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

It has also agreed an increase of $110m (£90m) on a credit facility, and a further $45m in UK government-backed loans to support large businesses hit by the coronavirus crisis.“Cineworld, as always, greatly believes in the theatrical experience and is fully committed to be the best place to watch a movie,” the company said. “Cineworld\u0026nbspis excited by the great movie line-up to follow the reopening of cinemas, starting with the highly anticipated new Chris Nolan movie Tenet and immediately after that with Mulan, a new Disney adventure movie.”Rival Vue, one of Europe’s largest cinema operators, has also said it intends to reopen in July with measures including physically isolating family groups and staggering film times to reduce crowding.Vue has previously said other measures would include controlling entrances and exits and reducing the overall capacity of each film screening.In Berlin, one theatre ripped out many seats to ensure safe distancing between members of the audience. Some cinema operators have installed plastic screens between seats.A small-scale reopening of cinemas in China in mid-March was abruptly halted by the government amid fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34175bff51e37f6eef5e1cd52ec6358b5891af0/3277_1437_1627_977/master/1627.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b81f83cfe2359b8ea0e8225833debe","title":"daily mail owner print advertising revenues plunge by 70 per cent dmgt covid 19","story":"DMGT also owns the i and  and Covid-19 lockdown has hit newspaper industryNewspaper publishers have benefited from record digital audiences as readers crave news on the coronavirus. However, with businesses shut down and many advertisers keen to steer clear of running promotions around content relating to the pandemic, publishers have failed to reap the benefits of an ad boost.DMGT said that it has been encouraged by print retail circulation volumes of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the i increasing each week since 5 April. The freesheet ’s circulation is running at about a quarter of its usual levels as the nation remains on lockdown and its commuter readers stay at home.“At this stage it is too early to assess the extent to which readership habits may permanently change once lockdown measures are lifted completely,” the company said. “The board remains confident, however, that high levels of reader engagement will help to support revenue recovery in time.”Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Despite the tough trading conditions, the company, which has also cancelled or postponed all events and exhibitions through to the end of August and expects to extend this to September, increased its interim idend payout to investors. Many companies have suspended or scrapped idends to shore up their balance sheets to weather the fallout of the coronavirus.“DMGT delivered a solid performance in the first half of the year, reflecting a strong first five months of trading followed by one month of weakness due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Paul Zwillenberg, the chief executive of DMGT. “Since February, we have moved quickly to protect our stakeholders and actively support our portfolio of businesses. Our consumer media, property information and events and exhibitions have been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.”Last month DMGT decided against furloughing any of the 2,400 staff at its publishing operation, instead asking employees to take a temporary pay cut in return for shares in the company. At the end of the year they will be able to cash in the shares and if the price has dropped the company will make up the difference, or they can hold on to the shares as an investment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33a47ef89cff2a21c16a9c2b201c9b39f0acd515/0_61_2785_1671/master/2785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=699c9a308df4843b0cdee987d6c78214","title":"fashion retailer boohoo buys out stake in pretty little thing","story":"Boohoo has bought out a minority stake in its Pretty Little Thing brand for more than £260m just days after criticism over a potential deal.The company said the acquisition would create “significant value for the group’s shareholders” and was an “important further step towards achieving its vision to lead the fashion e-commerce market globally by accelerating full ownership of a brand that is in high growth with enormous growth potential ahead of it”.The deal appears to be an attempt to draw a line under criticism from the hedge fund investor ShadowFall, which this week published a note suggesting that a recent £200m fundraising effort by Boohoo could be handed over in idends or buyout costs to Umar Kamani.Matthew Earl, the head of ShadowFall, who is known at the “Dark Destroyer” for the effect his research can have on companies’ share prices, said that in his view the PLT buyout announced on Thursday “raises more questions”.“Above all, this is another example of the Kamani family reducing its ownership in the company largely using cash,” Earl said.He questioned the relatively low valuation placed on the stake in PLT in the deal, in relation to the value of the group.Earl also said that shareholders were likely to be bemused by Boohoo spending the proceeds of its £200m share placing on the buyout of PLT, when a detailed statement put out on Tuesday confirmed earlier statements that the funds would be used “to take advantage of numerous opportunities” in the global fashion industry. Boohoo did not mention the potential fast-forwarding of acquiring the PLT stake.“To raise the money, suggesting that opportunities may emerge, but with no specific targets and then to buy PLT two years early is perplexing,” Earl said.Boohoo said that after the PLT acquisition it retained a strong balance sheet that would enable it to continue disrupting the fashion industry and take advantage of “numerous M\u0026ampA opportunities that are likely to emerge in the global fashion industry over the coming months”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab57d4af7a835c9d7d876ed3dce811c40547b7e2/0_365_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef8ec404ea80ebfe08c66a0357cd05c4","title":"gsk coronavirus vaccine booster 2021 glaxosmithkline","story":"World’s largest vaccine maker in talks with governments over manufacturing expansionGlaxoSmithKline plans to produce 1bn doses of vaccine efficacy boosters, or adjuvants, next year for use in Covid-19 treatment.The world’s largest vaccine maker said it was in talks with governments to back a manufacturing expansion that would help to scale up production of future vaccines for Covid-19.It gave no indication of costs, saying only that production would take place at sites in Europe and North America and that it would reinvest any profit into coronavirus research and preparation for future pandemics.GSK is working on its own Covid-19 vaccine with the French drugmaker Sanofi, one of the many projects to counter the respiratory illness that currently has no treatment and has killed about 350,000 people.The World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on face masks has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers – not the public.\u0026nbsp“Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,” the WHO has stated.Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.\u0026nbspThere is no robust scientific evidence – in the form of trials – that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.Also underlying the WHO’s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work.Adjuvants, an area where GSK leads many of its peers, have been shown to create a stronger and longer-lasting immunity against infections and allow for lower dosing of the protein in a vaccine, making way for higher-volume production.“We believe that more than one vaccine will be needed to address this global pandemic and we are working with partners around the world to do so,” said the GSK global vaccines president, Roger Connor.Experts have predicted a successful vaccine will take more than a year to develop and companies and governments are pouring money into dozens of programmes as their best hope of allowing a durable escape from lockdowns and getting economies expanding again.The US last week secured almost a third of the first 1bn doses planned for AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine by pledging up to $1.2bn.GSK said making its adjuvant available to the world’s poorest countries would be a key part of its efforts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2796706c6d572fb80aba142bd163013eef44d0/0_109_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6af123d46255967990fde5c1d65d4e4","title":"us job losses unemployment coronavirus","story":"Rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall from its early-April peak but claimants still face huge delaysThe number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week.The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic.The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week.While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression.\u0026nbspEven months after shutdown orders were put in place, the reported unemployment figures may not show a complete picture of how many people were laid off due to the crisis.Many states are still trying to work through backlogs of thousands of applications as antiquated online systems struggle to keep up with the number of applicants. Oregon, for example, announced this week that it is still trying to process 38,000 unemployment claims. At the end of April, only a third of claims in Hawaii, a state that relies heavily on its tourism industry, had been processed.\u0026nbspAfter Jazz Salm was laid off from her job as a server at Chile’s, she immediately got onto Florida’s unemployment system to file her claim. It took her about a week to get through the system since the website kept crashing. When she was finally able to submit her claim, it took another month until she started receiving payments.During that month, Salm, who lives in Sarasota, had no idea what the status of her application was. Having just used her savings to move in February, Salm was left without money to pay her bills or even buy groceries until payments came in.“I think the government just needs to realize that we just want to be heard,” Salm said. “It all comes down to acknowledgement that us little people –\u0026nbspyou know, what are we supposed to do? We’re stuck.”Over the last few weeks, all 50 states have begun some type of reopening measures, bringing hope that the economy will revive as people start going back to work. But it is unclear what effect the measures have had on unemployment.\u0026nbspBut many businesses that have reopened are operating with far-from-normal procedures, like social distancing in dine-in restaurants and movie theaters, that mean foot traffic is still down compared with pre-shutdown times. Many local businesses have had to shutter permanently, probably leaving tens of thousands of Americans unemployed indefinitely.\u0026nbspEven as businesses slowly start to reopen, the pandemic is still a major health threat. State governors seem to be holding their breath over what the consequences of reopening without robust contact tracing will be. The number of new Covid-19 cases rose in 17 states on Tuesday and the country has suffered about 100,000 Covid-related deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/200f6fb45caeeeb890ce0963eebde00dcac0854b/0_76_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355272226a8f49b582c2865edf79a6a8","title":"coronavirus infection rate too high second wave","story":"Test and tracing is launching today but, as the lockdown eases, it will need to be massively stepped up to have a significant impactWe all now know the basics – the R is the average number of people someone infected with Covid-19 passes the virus on to.\u0026nbspIf it is greater than 1.0 the epidemic will grow exponentially.\u0026nbspIf it is less than 1.0 it will eventually disappear.\u0026nbspThere are several types of R: the R0 that applies to a naive population with no immunity or interventions and the “effective R” or Re (also called Rt) that the politicians are talking about, and that measures how we are doing in controlling the virus.\u0026nbspWe calculate the R in several ways.\u0026nbspWhat it was two to four weeks ago can be back-calculated by the changes in Covid-19 hospitalisations or deaths.\u0026nbspThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is now doing national swab surveys to estimate the proportion of people who carry the virus and how that changes over time but these take a week or two to process and report.\u0026nbspThus, we cannot be very confident about the precise value of the R day to day, and can be even less confident about regional variations that are inevitably based on less data than the national numbers.The amount of virus each inidual\u0026nbspcarries may be partially responsible for this, but his or her opportunities to contact others – at parties, in the workplace, in restaurants or religious services – is important too.\u0026nbspThus, one man may have infected more than 90 clubgoers in South Korea, and one member of a choir in Washington State may have infected 52 out of 61 fellow chorists at a single rehearsal.Early estimates of R0, the original infection rate, for Covid-19 were in the range of 2.0 to 3.0, but more recent estimates have come in at 4.0 or more.\u0026nbspThis is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0.\u0026nbspThe infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not drop precipitously until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.\u0026nbspThe epidemic grew much faster prior to the lockdown than it has diminished afterwards.\u0026nbspTo decline at the same rate, the R number would now have to be about 0.25 – and no one thinks it has declined to that level.\u0026nbspAs Harvard epidemiology professor Bill Hanage has put it: “A fire burns fast at first but the embers take a long time to die down.”So where does this leave us over the next few months?\u0026nbspWith Re so close to 1.0 there are basically two options.\u0026nbspFirst, we could try to accelerate the decline in the number of infected people – bringing Re down further – so that efficient test, trace and isolate measures combined with the quarantine of new arrivals might give us a chance of suppressing the virus to the point of virtual elimination, as has been done in South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand and perhaps China.\u0026nbspIt became clear from the prime minister’s announcement on 10 May on easing the lockdown that the government has chosen instead to open up the economy when there are still large numbers of infected people who do not know they carry the virus – guaranteeing ongoing infections and the inability to suppress the virus.\u0026nbspAs a consequence, the Covid-19 death rate will stabilise but may not drop much lower, and the threat to older people and those in care homes will remain serious.Even to achieve stabilisation in the context of the “back to work and school” decisions already announced, three key control elements must be put in place.\u0026nbspIndoor gatherings of any sort must remain limited in size to prevent super-spreading events, and those who encounter many people each day, such as shop workers, care workers and bus drivers, should be given protective equipment and be tested regularly.\u0026nbspOn trains and buses, there are obvious implications for how many people can be commuting.\u0026nbspAnd the use of face coverings should be the new normal – including at government press briefings.And travel from one part of the country to another should be minimised, so infected travellers do not spark new epidemics in lower-risk regions.\u0026nbspThere are ominous signs that the mixed messages from the government have already led to more gatherings and crowded trains, and, in backing No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings, it has given the green light to long-distance travel.Stabilising the epidemic only buys time to find an effective treatment or vaccine.\u0026nbspPerhaps the warmer temperatures will help, if we responsibly socially distance outdoors while the epidemic rumbles on.\u0026nbspBut when the colder weather pushes us indoors, without a vaccine, and unless contact tracing is massively stepped up, there will be a second wave: the epidemic will resurge. Not because it had to, but because we did not push the virus closer to extinction, we did not plan properly for the rebound, and thus gave the virus a second lease of life. And all of this will guarantee more Covid-19 deaths in the UK.•\u0026nbspDavid Hunter is the Richard Doll professor of epidemiology and medicine in the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3fa9b74dc62e4c72ea4bc30890b99c2546d806b/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce059d7e9445243105e2874afcfe4c1","title":"dominic cummings democracy laws truth consequences","story":"Why should we keep faith with democracy when our leaders bend laws and distort truth?There is a moment in all British political scandals when a prickly sensation creeps up the spine: “He’s going to get away with it, isn’t he?” It isn’t provoked by Dominic Cummings alone. I felt the same watching Michael Gove’s exchange with Nick Ferrari on LBC: Gove first starting to claim that he too took the occasional miles-long drive to test his vision before rowing back, perhaps dazzled by the scale of the lie. Smirks were exchanged. The same when Matt Hancock stared down the camera on 30 April and celebrated “achieving” his testing target the reflux came two days ago, when revised testing figures revealed the target had, in fact, never been hit.It is not a sensation produced merely by lies, or the stench of hypocrisy in high places. It is the smirk, the assured belief that consequences are for little people, and that, in any case, anyone who really matters is in on the act. These people are open about it: to accept it is a mark of urbanity, to be disgusted by it is gauche.We have become used to being badly governed, and inured to lying. The prime minister’s laziness and mendacity are proverbial, but it is the mediocrity at the pinnacle of power that is more startling: the self-impressed dilettante and crank who whispers in his ear, or the toy-town thug - complete with pet tarantula - now in charge of the nation’s schools, or the conspiracy theorist “at war with cultural Marxism” now its most senior law officer, merrily dismissing the universality of law. The problem extends beyond politicians’ inidual deficiencies, severe though they are, and one might point to multiple sources of institutional rot to explain it, from the sycophancy of party bureaucracy to the evaporation of the civic bodies on which the great parties once drew. But there is also another, simpler explanation: politicians are increasingly insulated from the consequences of lying.The UK institutionalises its corruption, with peerages regularly doled out to party patrons. Even British politicians realise that allowing donors to purchase a permanent seat in the legislature looks bad so, formally at least, it is illegal.\u0026nbspDespite this, donors still acquire peerages\u0026nbspwith appalling regularity as this is a useful source of patronage, all the major parties simply look the other way.\u0026nbspBut this is emblematic of a wider institutional rot. Now Tory fundraisers, eyeing a Covid-19 collapse in cash, brief journalists that the party’s billionaire donors are cooling on Johnson for his failure to deliver them the peerages they expected. Such open entitlement ought to be a scandal itself, signalling a willingness to further dilute the UK’s already weak institutional safeguards instead it is greeted with jejune sophistication by commentators, proud to know that this is simply how the game works.Why are we so badly governed, to the point that we scarcely notice it? Stories of national decline are a cottage industry in Britain, and laments for a decaying polity are common in times of upheaval.\u0026nbsp“Where is now the soul of god-like Cato that durst be good” asked one stage character in the fag-end days of Elizabethan England, “when Caesar durst be evil?” That play itself – Ben Jonson’s\u0026nbsp1603 Sejanus\u0026nbsp– drew on Tacitus’s ancient laments about the corruption of imperial Rome, and landed its author a trial for treason. It is instructive not only because it reminds us that this anxiety is historically common, but because the villain’s fall sees him replaced only with another\u0026nbspvillain, equally violent and cruel.Like many conservative “declinists” since,\u0026nbspJonson’s Romans laid the blame for the weakening and corruption of the state on the decay of virtue among the citizenry.\u0026nbspModern culprits for decline might range as widely as the doctrine of equality or political correctness, or moral laxity, or the degradation of our capacity to think as independent citizens. Liberal variations impute more fault to institutions, concentrating on the corrupting influence of cash, our archaic forms of government, or erosion of sacrosanct political norms.Such permeating cynicism arises above all from depoliticisation: the claim, advanced over the past few decades, that ideological difference is dead, markets ought to be insulated from political contestation, and politics is merely a set of technical quibbles between administrators. Depoliticisation has produced a more professionalised politics with narrower routes of entry, and constrained what is agreed to be politically possible: thus the sad post-Thatcherite trawl of crumbling PFI schools, underfunded hospitals and outsourced public services. If the possibility of significant political change is denied, popular revulsion becomes increasingly anti-political, rejecting the legitimacy of democratic deliberation.That is why the Cummings scandal matters. His recurrent motif is that liberal democracy is a con: that deliberation and debate are simply excuses by elites to stifle the popular will all you should expect from politics is the occasional authorising vote for a champion you hope will wreck the joint in the way you prefer. The law, in turn, is for little people who can’t find a way round it, and protests about its universality are another elite sham.It might be that Cummings has overestimated public indifference, and the wave of popular anger washes him from office. But perhaps perversely, prime ministerial backing strengthens, rather than weakens, the cynicism on which he feeds. Had it not involved him, Cummings would have used this episode as a teaching moment.Democracies are more resilient than some expect. But they are still fragile achievements. If the link between actions and consequences in politics is severed, why should the young or disenfranchised keep faith with democracy at all? The pandemic has reminded us that we are not isolated iniduals, and our choices impact profoundly on others.Perhaps it also implies other unfashionable truths: politics matters. Laws should not have get-out clauses for the rich. State power is immense, rather than weak, and no one is entitled to it by rank or wealth. There are deceptions that should see you drummed out of public life altogether.\u0026nbspIf the tawdry spectacle of ministers bending the law and distorting the truth to defend an unelected aide teaches us anything, it’s this: consequences matter.•\u0026nbspJames Butler is co-founder of Novara Media and a regular contributor to the London Review of Books"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcc5f5f52e40c0ccc8481fb286c557d386603b17/0_359_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95daa8a1cd5c816bb3b00e229d343f70","title":"government help freelancers coronavirus theatre","story":"The self-employment income support scheme is due to end. This will be catastrophic for thousands of creative peopleI love theatre. I love the people, the community, the buzz. But the future of this industry is under threat – a pain felt most deeply by the people who make it a fabulous business. On 16 March, London’s West End closed its doors. Regional tours followed suit shortly afterwards, leaving actors, musicians, technical, wardrobe, wigs and front-of-house staff unemployed overnight. Performers and musicians couldn’t be furloughed because they’re technically self-employed, despite many of them being contracted well into 2021. Of course, that was OK because of chancellor Rishi Sunak’s self-employment income support scheme (SEISS). Or was it?Unfortunately, for the thousands of people employed in the theatre industry, there were so many gaps to fall through. The help for self-employed people only lasts until the end of May, while the furlough scheme extends until October. Show business is notoriously unpredictable there is no job security, so if you earned more than £50,000 in profits each year over the past three years but haven’t been able to find work since, you are not eligible for the grant.Imagine if you’d just landed yourself the role of a lifetime and moved to London to pursue your dream. Perhaps you took out a six- or 12-month lease on a property, knowing you were contracted for the duration of the tenure, despite not earning anywhere near this amount last year. The hundreds of graduates fresh out of training, many with massive student debt, who have been working in the industry since last summer are also not eligible for the scheme as they haven’t yet had the chance to file a tax return. And another group who won’t benefit, despite paying their taxes, are people who trade as limited liability companies.It’s not that these people don’t want to work, are shielding, or taking an extended break during the pandemic. It’s that there are no jobs in the industry they’re employed in. What we all hoped might happen – SEISS until May, ready for a triumphant reopening of the West End in June, with all regions following shortly afterwards – has turned out to not be so simple. What happens after the end of May, both for those lucky enough to have claimed SEISS, and for those who fell through the gaps?These are real people with mortgages, rent, bills, children, elderly relatives. We’ve all accepted that theatre will be one of the last industries to regain some semblance of “normality”, so why can’t the government accept that the people who have fallen through the gaps need ongoing help?Many members of the theatre industry applied for universal credit only to be told they did not qualify. Every supermarket around London now has its own ensemble cast of temporary staff consisting of the hardworking, versatile people of the theatre industry – but these jobs won’t be here forever. And not everyone is able to get a temporary job.\u0026nbspThe government must act now to preserve the arts and help the amazing network of people that make the industry as spectacular as it is.Better schemes are possible. The Spanish government recently announced it would be introducing a universal basic income. And in the Netherlands and France, theatre professionals can rely on an established social security system that ensures artists still get paid between jobs – coronavirus or no coronavirus. What if the next Elaine Paige or Michael Ball has just had their first professional job cut short by the pandemic, and is financially unable to continue in the industry? The lack of support for people working in this industry sends a signal the government thinks that such occupations are merely a paid hobby, that people can rely on savings, or get a “proper” job until they’re “fortunate” enough to pick up where they left off.When I was employed by British Airways, belonging to Unite the Union was a saving grace. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by coronavirus, unions have greater power to hold industries and government to account. I recently spoke to Paul Fleming, who is a candidate to be the general secretary of Equity, the trade union for creative practitioners, and is currently the central London theatres organiser. “Thanks to strong unions, our members have organised good agreements to put the industry on pause we’re ready to reopen when it’s safe and practical. But without guaranteed income for all our industry’s freelancers, a whole workforce is threatened with being washed away – the most under-represented artists first,” he told me.“With no unions on the government’s reopening task force, and just days to go until SEISS ends, the government risks telling artists and audiences that they don’t care about theatre’s economic and social importance.”As a whole, the arts and culture industry brings £10.8bn\u0026nbspto the economy every year – not to mention every pre- and post-theatre dinner, every quick glass of wine in a pub before a show, every train, plane and bus ticket, every hotel stay. The true contribution of theatreland to local economies is incalculable. For every £1 invested in the arts by the government, the industry returns £5. This is our hour of need. At a moment like this, we need the arts more than ever.• Amy Hart is a former cabin crew manager and a 2019 Love Island contestant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df1a6f5a3a517f0a929db86dc949399a311c669/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e285d386e660177405470f2ee13729a7","title":"postcard future life denmark after lockdown","story":"As the restrictions lift and we emerge blinking from our homes, it’s possible to believe that life will be good againUnder the shade of umbrellas, pensioners eat cake at a cafe, children slosh cups of juice, and students clink beer bottles, smoking, laughing and talking loudly enough to be heard above the buzz of people who are now … everywhere.On 18 May, the doors of cafes, restaurants and shops were flung wide in Denmark and the high streets are bustling again. Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in “lanes”, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time. But Danes are happy to comply for the most part – if there are already four people buying ice-cream, they’ll just come back later.Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to lock down on 11 March. The borders were closed two days later and Denmark’s famous hygge was put to the test as Danes were forced to stay home (although no restrictions were placed on outdoor exercise). As a rule-abiding bunch, Danes trusted that the government had their best interests at heart and so did as they were told. Every Saturday during lockdown, locals flew the Danish flag in solidarity and instead of clapping for health workers, Denmark’s answer to TV choirmaster Gareth Malone led Daily Morgensang (Daily Morning Song) on TV station DR1 to keep morale up. And it worked. Prime minister Mette Frederiksen’s hard and fast coronavirus strategy paid off – in a country of 5.8 million, the number of Covid-19 deaths stands at just 563 at time of writing and infection rates are low (0.7).Curve duly flattened, Denmark was the first country in Europe to reopen primary schools – as well as kindergartens and day-care institutions – in mid-April, following the advice that young children were the least at risk. Some were nervous at the idea of sending small children out to test the water, but after five weeks of supposedly “working from home” with three kindergarteners, I was tempted. With work Zoom calls regularly gatecrashed by Elsa from Frozen and bare bottoms (lockdown brought out the nudist in my kids), my husband and I decided to go for it. Socialising young children is considered crucial in Denmark and as one psychologist friend put it: “We like the idea that children are brought up not only by their parents but by a whole society, including teachers, school friends, grandparents etc. They learn different perspectives from different relationships.” He added: “I also like the idea that I’m not the only one responsible for their development and wellbeing.” Danes worked out quickly that social distancing was impossible with young children, who essentially lick everything they see. Instead, kids stay in “protective bubbles” – keeping to their own zones in the playground in small groups and sticking with the same teacher. Pupils from different classes are assigned different entrances and no parents are allowed inside the school. There are no face masks – for pupils or teachers lessons are outside whenever possible, and handwashing is hourly (eczema flare-ups abound). Teachers sport hand-sanitiser sprays like cowboys in a weird western and all equipment is disinfected several times a day.Denmark’s schools started off with a two-metre social distancing rule, but this has now been reduced to one metre and dropped entirely for kindergarteners. From 18 May, kids aged 11-plus returned to school, and they were also separated into smaller groups. This has been a logistical challenge but teachers have already seen the better teacherchild ratio as beneficial to behaviour – and kids polled say they’re glad to be back, following the isolation of home schooling.Many adults, by contrast, are content to still be working from home (without distractions). Denmark was already renowned for its work-life balance, but lockdown life has highlighted the importance of flexibility for employees. Some office workers are returning to their desks a few days a week, but there’s a sense that employers can no longer demand the same presenteeism or demanding commutes as before. Meeting face to face isn’t always necessary and shaking hands – previously a stalwart of Danish etiquette, done with everyone from your GP to your dentist and every member of a social gathering – is now a thing of the past.I can live without handshakes. What I miss are hugs, from friends. Socialising online made many of us strangely intimate. We didn’t know when we’d next see each other and so we opened up, skipping the small talk. Once we were officially allowed to socialise again in small groups, it was strange at first, tuning into friends in real life and talking about things other than coronavirus. But after the initial awkwardness, it was … brilliant (and blurry. Sore heads all around the next day). When restaurants and bars reopened, we emerged, blinking, from our homes, conscious of trying to keep up the meaningful connections that were somehow easier and more frequent when “normal life” wasn’t in the way.Danes have now been advised that they can see and even hug grandparents again, but for those with very elderly relatives or in at risk groups, the isolation continues. Hospitals are coping, but the threat of coronavirus means that anyone admitted is tested for Covid-19 as a matter of course and no visitors are allowed. I don’t know when I’ll see family in the UK since borders are still closed to foreign visitors (with some exceptions). But for the majority of those living Danishly, the silence of lockdown has been a time to re-evaluate – to notice things, good and bad, take stock, break habits and start over. Many are relearning the delights of the Danish countryside, of slowing down, of looking after each other. And now, in Denmark, there’s a mood of optimism best summed up by the slogan det bliver godt igen – or “it will be good again”.• Helen Russell is the bestselling author of The Year of Living Danishly.

But since coronavirus hit, politics and business are thinking againTiming matters. Early 2020 saw an economic collapse the likes of which have not been seen in living memory. Growth has collapsed, unemployment has soared, poverty has increased.Yet in different circumstances the past few months would have been dominated by calls for countries to do more to cut carbon emissions. As 2019 drew to an end, everybody from the managing director of the International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspto the governor of the Bank of England was warning of the threat of global heating.A year of floods, hurricanes and bush fires had made a strong case for action to make economies more sustainable. What was lacking was a profound shock that would make change possible. Now we’ve had one.Governments are creating, borrowing and spending money like never before in peacetime, in an attempt to mitigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have the opportunity to reshape their economies in a way that would be consistent with preventing catastrophic increases in global temperatures. Businesses are already learning lessons from the lockdown, such as that modern technology no longer makes it essential for an executive to travel half way round the world for a business meeting, and that employees can be just as productive working from home as they can when sat in expensive set-piece city centre offices.The world has been here before, though, and there is no guarantee that an opportunity proffered will be an opportunity taken. One was certainly missed at the back end of the 2000s, when the banks nearly went bust. Supporters of a Green New Deal\u0026nbsp(of whom I was one) said governments should avert the possibility of a second Great Depression by investing in decarbonisation of their economies and programmes that would put people back to work by making their homes energy-efficient.Things look a bit different this time. The UK economy shrank by as much in March – when there was barely more than a week of lockdown – as it did in the whole of the 2008-9 recession. April’s number will be a lot worse, and recovery is going to be slow, even assuming there is no second wave of infections.During the financial crisis, the then Labour government took a stake in two of Britain’s high-street banks. This time, a Conservative government has effectively nationalised the railways, announced plans to support strategically important companies, and is paying the wages of more than 10 million workers.What’s more, it has been a case of money is no object. The UK is on course to borrow £300bn this year at dirt cheap interest rates. The Bank of England is creating money through its quantitative easing programme. The argument that a Green New Deal is unaffordable is still knocking around, but is much less powerful than it was a decade ago. Ministers can decide whether they want to do more than respond to the immediate crisis and they certainly have the power to shape the recovery by making demands of the companies they are supporting, if they choose to use it.Here the picture is mixed. Governments make all the right noises about sustainability, yet many of them have used the crisis as an excuse for relaxing or suspending environmental regulations in order to stimulate activity of any sort. Those who think action of global heating should be a matter for markets not governments see Covid-19 as an opportunity too.But only up to a point. For some, lockdown has provided a glimpse of what a sustainable economy might look like. For others – those who face losing their jobs in carbon-intensive sectors – that sort of future doesn’t look so attractive.Politics reflects this tension. If parties of the left sometimes seem less enthusiastic about a GND than they might be, it is because a lot of the people who vote for them like the idea of cheap flights and rely on their old banger to pay visits to their mum. No question, any transition to a greener, more sustainable economy will have to overcome not just active opposition but passive resistance from those who would like life to return to its pre-Covid-19 crisis state.One solution might be to trial in one of the UK’s big cities – Manchester or Glasgow, say – to see whether a GND creates jobs, cuts emissions and generates a new wave of profitable environmental innovation. Opponents of change don’t need to do anything they simply need to wait for inertia to kick in. Those who want a different sort of economy need to start somewhere. And they should start with a simple question: if not now, when?• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dbcac3b6c6a50ac88d5c22f4a798279615911b9/453_589_3497_2099/master/3497.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc017bfe7ffe4c96742260ff4062ff8","title":"share your photos of butterflies in the uk","story":"We want to see your photos of butterflies you have spotted around the country during the sunny weather Due to a combination of warmth and sunshine across the UK, butterflies have been spotted enjoying the good weather.If you have seen any near you, we’d like to see your photos.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

From Normal People to Angela Rayner, DIY bangs are the new normalAs our contact with the outside world shrinks to the size of a screen, once-private things have been pushed to the fore.Our bookshelves, formerly unseen by our co-workers, have become pregnant with meaning. Our tired faces, once optimised for the workplace with concealer and a fancy neckline, are beginning to crack after one too many Zoom meetings. For those of us working from home, headshots are the new hemlines.Then there is our hair: our rubbish, 10-week too-long hair that we can’t really improve without breaking the law – or at least a headband (although according to the Freelance Association of Hairdressers, clients are trying, “offering thousands of pounds” for an illicit trim). There has recently been further uproar over Dominic Raab’s plans to not open salons until July.Like so many successful things in 2020, the lockdown fringe began on social media and, also like so many things, was consolidated in Britain by the TV adaptation of Normal People. Connell’s silver chain might have spawned its own social media account and be “comparable to what James Dean did for the simple white T-shirt” (according to its costume designer), but so, too, has Marianne’s evolving fringe, which came with its own story arc – choppy when young, flourishing during her sexual prime, and so on – and now its own Instagram account, @Mariannesbangs, with 5,000 followers and counting. Earlier this month, Vanity Fair even published an essay in homage, called Fringe Watch. Sandra Kelly, the show’s hair designer, describes the online reaction to Marianne’s bangs as “Fringemania”.Still, a sharp, face-framing fringe on Zoom has become yet another impossible beauty standard to add to the list, and one that reflects self-improvement over pandemic restriction. While Bella Hadid cut hers in lockdown to match Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday with surprising deftness, and Anna Wintour seems to have a live-in hairdresser, it appears deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has chosen not to touch hers in her last television appearance on The Andrew Marr show, she had swept it artfully to one side.If hair has become a talking point of lockdown – and further proof that personal grooming is key to our welfare regardless of what is happening in the outside world (the re-opening of beauty salons in Italy this month allegedly outranked restaurants and shops in demand) – then DIY fringe cuts are a distillation of this new normal. Lengths vary, but the sentiment remains – a good fringe is proof that the wheels of professionalism are working nicely, even if they are coming off.We’re now 10 weeks into lockdown and well past the sweet spot of a recommended trim – “which is absolutely six to eight weeks”, according to Northwood, the man who coined and cultivated The Alexa (Chung) and The Claudia (Winkelman). As for the fringe, “it generally has a four-week shelf life. So if you went into lockdown with one, chances are you will have given yourself one trim already”. Northwood has been guiding clients such as Winkelman into cutting hers at home, using clips, point cutting and texturising scissors, videos of which have been uploaded on to social media. He says most of his work right now is on YouTube.“Cutting your hair now is mostly born out of necessity, and yes definitely a way to feel like you are in control, that you are not losing yourself,” says Rachael Gibson, a hair historian. To many people, the thought of going to a hair salon represents a return to normality after a long, destabilising period – in lieu of this, cutting our hair is as close as we can get.In these screen-focused times, and with mask-wearing soon possibly to be mandatory, could we be on the cusp of a Fringe Index?The pandemic has plunged us into deep uncertainty. The twist, says Northwood, is that people are also after fringes when salons re-open in July. “It seems that cutting your hair is one thing, but focusing on the fringe is more like a mood change, something that marks a new beginning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cb4d6465d1310cbadd4185e06ccb455925bde08/0_6_1125_675/master/1125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b83fc05b77e13767faa667b4889cc68","title":"adam mitter celebrity english king of indonesian football","story":"Globetrotting defender plays in front of 40,000-plus fans, one of whom declared the day they met ‘the best day of my life’In Indonesia Adam Mitter is known as “the King”. The English defender is Persiraja Banda Aceh’s captain in the country’s top flight, the latest move in a nomadic life that looks on paper more like a backpacking holiday than a professional football career.Mitter has played in Sweden, India, the Philippines, Canada and Singapore since leaving the UK after spells with Blackpool and Hibernian. The centre-back has captained five of the seven clubs he has represented, a sign of the respect he has earned, despite being relatively unknown in his homeland.Indonesia, like the rest of the world, has been put on hold, allowing the 27-year-old to enjoy life next to a pool in Bali. Mitter is a celebrity in Aceh, where his club are based, and has an impressive social media following. “Just before the league stopped,” he says, “I went to grab a coffee and the guy froze, he started shaking, saying: ‘This is the best day of my life, I can’t believe I get to meet you,’ which really puts it into perspective what football means to people and how important it is to get results for these people, because when we walk down the streets everybody knows who you are and it really is like being a Premier League footballer.”With this sort of reaction to meeting him, it is little surprise that Mitter has continued his worldwide odyssey, enjoying the various cultures and football styles along the way. “My mindset was that I wanted to see the world – we only live once – and I am very fortunate that football has enabled me to travel across the world,” he explains. “I have played a lot in Asia, Canada, Australia – these are the types of places people want to visit and luckily enough I have been paid to go to these places and perform what I love doing.”The journey started with a move to Ange in Sweden, where Mitter led the team to the fifth-tier title. “Sweden was a fantastic year. We had a great team there were a lot of English boys over there as there isn’t any restrictions on foreign players. We won the league, I was captain and it was fantastic. I am where I am now because I managed to go abroad at an early age, play some good football and get good results.”After brief spells with Barrow and Chorley, Mitter was back in the air. First, he played in Australia, before heading to Manila to join Loyola Meralco. Following a season in the Philippines, the bags were packed and Mitter signed for Fateh Hyderabad. “India has a fantastic football crowd, they really get behind the team. They’re very passionate, just like they are with cricket. Football is rivalling cricket, so they get lots and lots of fans.“The Philippines did not have as many fans but I fell in love with it as a country. That’s why I stayed there for three years with different teams. For anyone who’s not been to the Philippines, Manila is amazing and they also have some private islands, so you can go visit them when you have time off.”Mitter usually spends a year with a club, as he continues to see the world, while being paid to play football. The former Blackpool youngster has become adept at adapting to new surroundings.“I am quite open-minded and I try to make the best of every situation. Some places can be difficult to start off with but they become easier. I always tell myself to stay for four weeks and see how it is after that. At the end of the day you can always book a plane ticket home if it’s not what you expect but luckily I’ve not regretted any of the places I have been.”Carlton Cole, Michael Essien and Danny Guthrie are among those who played in Indonesia where football is hugely popular and draws passionate crowds. “For the fan experience, Indonesia has been by far the best. Every stadium is full, 40,000-50,000 thousand every game, it’s really like playing in the Premier League. Since joining my social media has gone absolutely crazy. It’s an unbelievable experience to play football in Indonesia, especially in front of the fans, that’s the reason I came here.“I have a lot of friends who are playing in England, from the Premier League to League Two now I’ve come to Indonesia, they see the passion of the fans and they’re very interested. You live a fantastic lifestyle here and you play in atmospheres like the Championship and Premier League – not many teams get 30,000-40,000 every single week. I think a lot of lads in England are opening their eyes, realising it’s not just England, there are other countries, other experiences you can enjoy.”Mitter’s career is proof of the variety of football experiences on offer, and brings him interest from unexpected countries. “Every year I get offers from clubs. Last year I got an offer from the Males and I didn’t even know they had a league. You think of the Males and think what an amazing country it is.

You can’t imagine you won’t be there to experience those early days up close and personal.”Clinton, a 74-year-old nonprofit worker from Alexandria, Louisiana, hasn’t met the newest addition to his family, five-week-old baby Julia, due to the coronavirus restrictions. His son Ryan and daughter-in-law Sarah had baby Julia on 23 April. Julia is their third child, and under normal circumstances Clinton and his wife Susan would have visited as soon as possible after the birth.But that wasn’t going to be possible: the family lives in Austin, Texas, and it wouldn’t be responsible to visit, even if only to see the baby from a distance. “The process of getting to Julia, being exposed to the gas stations and convenience stores … it just wasn’t possible,” says Clinton. “We agonize over it, we grieve over it, but at the end of the day, we know it’s the right thing to do.”Clinton is one of the many grandparents across the world missing out on those precious early months of their grandchildren’s lives. This is a challenging time for them: they are grateful that their grandchildren have arrived safe and healthy in the face of a frightening virus – doctors are not yet sure of Covid-19’s effect in pregnancy – and yet that relief is tempered with sadness at the knowledge that they may not see these babies for months, or possibly more if a vaccine is not found.“We have to keep it in perspective,” says Liz Griffiths, 63, a retiree from Surrey, UK. Her first grandchild, Max, was born on 29 March to Griffiths’ daughter, Bekki. “He’s safe, we’re safe, Bekki is safe, and this hopefully won’t last forever.” But of course, missing the birth of your first grandchild is a challenging experience. Griffiths and her husband had cleared their schedule so that they could visit after Max’s birth and help with childcare. After Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown on 23 March, they realised that would be impossible.There is the emotional side of the coronavirus lockdown: the anguished realisation that you won’t be there for your grandchildren’s first weeks in the world. But there are also practical considerations. In those early months, grandparents often look after older children, help keep the house tidy and prepare meals, and watch the baby whie the parents sleep. Without that support, new parents can feel overwhelmed.“It’s been so stressful,” sighs 31-year-old stay-at-home mom Katelyn Cousins from St Petersburg, Florida. Katelyn gave birth to her second child with her husband Will three weeks ago. In addition to baby Meadow, Katelyn has an 18-month old daughter, Margot. When we speak, Katelyn sounds tired – I can hear the baby crying in the background. “I’m about an eight out of 10 for exhaustion right now,” she admits.The difference between Meadow and Margot’s births feels stark. When Margot was born, Will’s parents stayed with them for two weeks, before Katelyn’s mom took over. During those weeks, the grandparents helped with childcare and gave them parenting tips. “They showed us different methods for calming the baby when it’s crying, how to ease gas, that kind of thing,” she says. “I definitely look up to my mom and her parenting style, so it was nice to have that comfort there, and my husband doesn’t always know the right thing to do when both of them are crying.”Now, with Will working from home due to the coronavirus restrictions, the burden of almost all the childcare falls on Katelyn. “My husband is a hard sleeper, so night duty is basically me,” she says. “He’s super-helpful when he can be, but with him having to work, it’s hard. I definitely feel like I’m in zombie mode all the time.”When you’re sacrificing the ability to see your grandchildren to obey the rules, watching others flout lockdown rules can be hugely chagrinning. “I get very annoyed,” says Paul Hawkins, 64, a retiree from Warwickshire. “I haven’t seen my grandchild yet, and you see other people living nearby whose grandchildren are coming around every day.” Hawkins’ son Neil and his wife, Ellen, gave birth to their second child, son Chester, on 17 April. Even when the lockdown restrictions are eased, Hawkins probably won’t meet Chester for a while – his mother-in-law Peggy lives with him, and as she’s 97, she’s extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.Griffiths is the only grandparent to have caught a glimpse of the baby: tragically, her mother-in-law Dorothy died the week after baby Max was born. At the small, socially distanced funeral, Griffiths saw baby Max from a distance, in the car park. “We stayed a safe distance away,” she says. “It’s bizarre, meeting your grandson at a funeral. It was very difficult.” One small blessing – Griffiths was able to show Dorothy pictures of Max before she died. “She was in frail health by then, but she smiled,” Griffiths remembers. “We think she did understand who he was.”All the grandparents I speak with have been keeping in touch through FaceTime and Zoom. It’s nice, but no substitute for being able to hold the newborns or sing them to sleep. Griffiths has attended online baby classes on Zoom, for parents and grandparents.“We’ve seen him a lot on screen,” Hawkins says of baby Chester, “but it’s not the same as holding him or being there, I suppose.” Watching a baby’s first weeks on Earth digitally can be jarring: you notice their growth more acutely than you would in real life. “In such a short time,” Hawkins says, “you really see how he’s grown and changed. It’s sad to know you’ve missed that first month.”Clinton relishes the photos and videos Ryan and Sarah send him of baby Julia. “We are taking advantage of the technology, which makes things so much better than they would have been if we were living through the 1918 flu pandemic, and relying on letters for news,” he says. Ryan sent pictures of baby Julia from the delivery room, shortly after she was born. “I was in my office and got the text and ran to the other part of the house to show Susan,” Clinton remembers. “We hugged.”Watching Julia grow up online is a bittersweet joy. “Each new set of pictures is great on one level, but on another level it underscores the distance and makes you want to get on a highway, throw the rules out, behave how you’d never behave, and just go.” He sighs.“But then your better angels prevail, and you do the right thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d23fef4bf608f7033363987efe75da2659e72a/0_265_4799_2879/master/4799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a607d69e5f4fc78b501df58b8c0c7c02","title":"start slow wear what you like watch out for zombies a beginners guide to running","story":"There’s a replacement to your pre-lockdown workout right outside your door. Experienced runners explain how to get startedThe gyms, pools and squash courts are shut. Joe Wicks is showing you how to get fit in your living room, but really all you want to do is get out of your living room. Now is the time to go for a run.If you are worried you’re not a running type, don’t be. I wasn’t either until I decided that I didn’t feel safe going to the gym in mid-March. Eight weeks later, I finished my first half-hour run, covering an apparently respectable 4.83km in the process. Almost anyone can be a runner, it turns out. So why not give it a try?The great thing about running is that you don’t need membership of a fancy club, expensive equipment or a qualified coach. But you do have to get some stuff: a good pair of shoes is non-negotiable, as is a sports bra if you need one.You don’t need to go wild for these things: yes, £200 will get you the pair of shoes that helped Eliud Kipchoge run the first sub-two-hour marathon, but beginners can settle for something much cheaper. But do resist the urge to just whack on the pair of throwback Nikes you bought for fashion purposes last year.“For people who are starting out, it’s important not to get bogged down in the kit, and actually think about the action of running,” says Anna Harding, the host of YouTube’s the Running Channel. “But I would suggest investing in a new pair of specific running trainers, and, for women, a sports bra. You don’t know the state of your old shoes, and it’s important to take care of your feet and knees. Other than that, though, wear what you feel good in.”When you first hit the road, you need to run slowly. Really slowly. So slowly you feel silly because of how slowly you are running. Slow enough that you’re pretty sure you could overtake yourself at a brisk walk.The point of running is endurance, and the most important thing to do is to make sure that you keep your heart rate elevated for the entire period of every training run. That means, especially at the beginning, erring on the side of caution: if you run slowly and find yourself barely breaking a sweat 20 minutes in, then you can speed up, but if you go too fast at the start, those last five minutes are going to be tough.“Start slow” also applies to how you should build up stamina over the first few weeks and months of your run. Thankfully, there is a best-in-class option here: the Couch to 5k programme, originally created by Josh Clark, an American software designer, in 1996. The idea is simple: run three times a week for eight weeks, beginning with sessions that involve more walking than actual running, and ending with 30 minutes of non-stop jogging.Your first session sees you running for a minute then walking for 90 seconds, and repeating the pattern eight times – enough to get an elevated heart rate for 20 minutes, and to get a solid eight minutes of actual running in. Four weeks later, the running has increased to three sets of five minutes, separated by three minutes of walking. And at the end of week five, the training wheels come off, and you run for a full 20 minutes non-stop.When I first tried to become a runner, in 2009, I would manually create those routines, booting up GarageBand on an old laptop and recording myself saying “run” and “walk” over the top of whatever I wanted to listen to, then loading it on to an iPod Shuffle. No wonder I didn’t stick with it. These days, it’s easier: the NHS has produced a podcast and app that automatically coaches you through the first nine weeks of your run.Some people think I’m daft for running to podcasts, wondering how on earth I can get into a good rhythm while catching up on Today in Focus. Sometimes, I think they’re nuts for running to music: no matter how good a tune is, it’s not distracting enough to save me from getting a bit bored 20 minutes in.If you want something more active still, you could try Zombies, Run! The app, which first launched eight years ago, lets you play through audio adventures timed to encourage and motivate you throughout a workout. A stand-alone couch-to-5k version can accompany you right from the start.“I started running when I was 20 or 21, and when we started Zombies, Run!, I was 28 or 29. Now I’m 37,” says Adrian Hon, the app’s co-creator. “I was a runner at that point, but I intensely remember the experience of not being a good runner. It came to me hard.”No one cares how sweaty you are, whether the top you run in is too bright or how fast or slow you’re going. So don’t worry about it. “A lot of the advertising, marketing and branding around running is incredibly unhelpful,” Hon says, “because it makes people think that a runner is some athletic supercharged person in Nike gear who doesn’t sweat. People get really self-conscious about that, and they get embarrassed. But no one gives a shit. Really: no one gives a shit what you look like.”Pavement space is at a bit of a premium right now, and in some places, that has led to hard feelings between runners, walkers and cyclists – not to mention the drivers who still get the majority of the road.“It has certainly become more of an obstacle course as we try to maintain the two-metre distance,” Harding says. “And I think as runners we are getting a little bit of side-eye from pedestrians, perhaps because of some reports suggesting that runners aren’t adhering to physical distancing.”It isn’t all negative, says Hon. “Obviously, there are more people running. Which is nice in some ways – you feel like you’ve got company. But it’s also tricky you’re having to weave in between people.“It’s a bit of a game: how do I maintain physical distancing while running? But there’s a happy medium, and there can occasionally just be too many people trying to share one fairly thin pavement. You’ve got to be very forgiving. It’s hard – sometimes I get annoyed when people run close to me. But risk is, I think, not as high as many other activities.”There are an awful lot of services that will track your stats, engage in virtual races or let you join a global community of runners. But before you jump in, remember why you’re running. It’s probably not to be the fastest among your friends, and if you’re not careful, such features can be more dispiriting than motivating.“People react to this stuff differently. In general, it is quite motivating to see yourself get faster, and to see yourself run further,” says Hon. “But when you have this social-media stuff … I think people are just too different. It becomes hard for it to be interesting or useful. Some people may like it, but the problem is that for most people, unless all their friends are runners, their range of abilities are all over the place.”Harding agrees: “The first thing to overcome is pride. For a lot of people, they’ll either compare themselves with where they used to be or to their friends who are running, or have been running a while.”“Motivation is something that will hit you during your early stages of running,” Harding says, “and continue to hit you after your running journey. And so that first day of ‘I really don’t fancy it today’ is one to overcome. But to steal a slogan from a well-known brand … just do it. You will genuinely feel better. I have never gone for a run and regretted it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25273b6341cfb9e538ae6f0d6ee78737016b41ec/0_344_5120_3073/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23053d736e73513a3a09d40fe490c6ba","title":"walk this way how to optimise your stride and focus your mind to get the most from your daily stroll","story":"Lockdown has reminded us of the pleasures of walking. But making small changes can boost its benefits to our health, mood and creativity, tooAs a form of physical activity, it is easy to dismiss walking as, well, pedestrian. But now its benefits, both physical and mental, are being appreciated once again. Under lockdown, daily walks became sacred. Now they are the safest way to commute, and, for those stuck at home, there is little place else to go other than to wander the streets, forests, towpaths, cemeteries and eerily deserted business quarters.We have become nosy tourists in our own neighbourhoods. We seek out less-travelled backwaters, eyeing curiously the fragments of human and animal lives that we pass, gazing on seasonal changes like besotted new parents. But are we walking to the best of our abilities? Possibly not. Sports scientist Joanna Hall has dedicated her career to coaching people in how to walk the way their bodies were designed to, which no longer comes easily in this sedentary, screen-based era.“I approach this as you would do if you wanted to get better at tennis,” she says. She developed her Walk Active programme to enable people to ease their aches and pains as they exercise, rather than exacerbate them. Lifestyle, ageing and injuries mean that when we put one foot in front of the other, the way we use our muscles may be, she says, “suboptimal for improving our posture, or reducing joint strain and getting the most out of walking”.According to Hall, there are four common aspects we get wrong, and each has knock-on effects on the body. Firstly, instead of propelling ourselves forwards by pushing off with the back foot, like an ice-skater, we try to use our stepping foot to power us along. This is because sitting down too much has made our hip flexor muscles short and tight. Hall describes the necessary adjustment as the subtle difference between stepping into a space (wrong) and pushing off from a space, which will recruit the right muscles up the backs of your legs. “You use your glutes and you open up the core,” says Hall.The second problem is what Hall calls a passive foot strike. The movement provided by the joints in our feet offers suspension and balance but we often plod along flatly instead, leaving us compromised. “That’s what causes knee discomfort,” says Hall. “It can create slight misalignment of the back, stiffness of the shoulders.”The third thing to watch out for is letting your head hang forwards. Screens, reading and desk work have made this the default position, which is a bit of a disaster. “When the head is slightly forward,” says Hall, “the muscles of the upper back and the shoulders have to contract to hold it there. The shoulders come forward and can stiffen. Back mobility becomes restricted and you will not be able to rotate your spine from the hips.” Try lifting your head before looking over your shoulder and you may discover, as I did, that you can turn your head much further all of a sudden.Finally, our arms tend to hang awkwardly or we force them into tense, power-walk movements, when what they want is to dangle freely. If you get steps one to three right, this should happen naturally. Hall has devised various drills to help correct these bad habits, such as measuring with your hand the gap between your bottom rib and your hip, and between your collarbone and your earlobe, and then adjusting your posture to lengthen those gaps. Walking with her tips in mind has made me feel lighter more gazelle than galumph.Now that lockdown rules have eased, we can get some desperately needed time with friends or family members. Yes, not being allowed to hug is painful, but physically distanced walking together is the next best thing. This is because when two people walk together, they unconsciously fall into step. As a 2012 study by US and Japanese researchers found, when people move in sync together, their neural activity synchronises too. The more in sync we are, the deeper our social connection, so walking in step is pretty much a physically distanced hug.Walking has long been hailed as an aid to creativity, too, by big thinkers from Aristotle to Wordsworth to Stanford University behavioural scientist Marily Ann Oppezzo. In 2018, Oppezzo and her colleagues, who study creativity, published research that set out to demonstrate this lightbulb effect. Participants who brainstormed while walking thought of significantly more valid ideas than those who tried to do the same while sitting.So if you have to attend a (socially-distanced) brainstorming meeting, says Oppezzo, “go think about ideas beforehand while walking.” Brainstorming in groups, she says, is far less productive.If you need to maximise the potential of a creative walk – perhaps you are finally starting that novel while quarantining – she suggests picking a problem or topic beforehand and thinking about potential new perspectives on it while you walk. Rather than taking a “deep e”, she says, walking is great for taking a stroll around a subject, seeing it from different sides and coming up with new ideas.She recommends travelling at a comfortable pace, so your physical exertion needs minimal attention, and coming up with as many ideas as you can, rather than trying to lock on to the first one you have. And if the ideas aren’t flowing, don’t force it. Come back to it another time.Crucially, in the study, she had participants record their ideas, rather than write them down, “because the idea of writing something down is already a filter – is this good enough to write down? You can put your headphones on and record through your phone.” And if you are feeling self-conscious, the headphones allow you to pretend to passers-by that you’re having a phone conversation.As well as percolating the cerebral juices, there are powerful mental-health benefits to be gained from walking. Half an hour of walking per day has been found to be as helpful as more intense 20-minute workouts in treating depression. Hugh O’Donovan, a psychologist based in Cork, wrote about the beneficial effects in his 2015 book Mindful Walking: Walk Your Way to Mental and Physical Well-Being. Walking provides what he calls “natural meds”, and there are no rules. Do you want to walk alone or with others? Do you listen to music or the outside world? Right now, enjoying the variety of options is key. “You have different locations and different routes,” says O’Donovan. “You can pick up the pace when you like, or you can slow down and be a bit more mindful. It doesn’t really matter. It’s just the fact that you’re doing it.”To reinforce the positive effects, he suggests “experimenting with noticing how you’re feeling. Is it lifting my mood? Am I meeting people and socialising a little?” However you prefer to walk, he invites you to “come to your senses. This is profoundly important because much of the time we’re on autopilot. We’re unconscious, unaware of what’s going on around us. There’s magic all around us all the time but we’re too busy.” Coronavirus has slowed life down, perhaps making it a little easier to pay attention. “What are you seeing, smelling, tasting?” he asks. “The world looks like a completely different place when you bring this quality of curiosity to everything you do. People underestimate its value.”While walking helps oil the cogs of the mind, and can help you get perspective if you’re struggling with something seismic such as grief, a job loss or the uncertainty of life under Covid-19, it pays to be aware of the risks of rumination. Namely, says O’Donovan, “the error and bias that’s associated with thinking, which lead us down a slippery slope into catastrophising and predicting the future negatively.” How can you avoid repeating the unhelpful and yet perfectly natural response, “why me?” or “why this?” Ask instead, says O’Donovan, “what now?” Walking can help with this. “The world opens up in a different way when we lift our mood, when we don’t fall into the hole.“Your best chance to stay in contention, as I call it, is to be mindful about what’s going on in the world,” he continues. “It might seem like it’s very dark at the moment, but there’s lots of good stuff going on too. Focus on what kind of a story you choose to tell. And, by getting out, moving and keeping your energy up, you have the possibility of telling a more positive story.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5907b4dbbf77ceee55e58958f38575584287ba48/1164_1063_3388_2033/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=995bc22d8609f3df2589f3b3a247f144","title":"zoom shabbat unexpected joy","story":"Shabbat for me used to mean a break from screens, but as I drop into synagogues all over North America, I’m reminded we’re all in this together Before the pandemic, Shabbat for me meant a break from screens. My synagogue, housed in a century-old building on a residential street in a quiet Toronto neighbourhood, observes the ancient laws that prohibit the use of technology on the Sabbath. A few Saturdays a month, I used to dress up, walk to shul (synagogue), and leave the frenetic demands of the secular, wired world behind. Since the pandemic shut the doors to my synagogue, I reluctantly turned to online shul to fill the void. Shabbat by Zoom, it turns out, is unexpectedly nourishing. Last month, the leaders of the conservative movement of Judaism gave rabbis the green light to livestream on Shabbat. Thousands of Jews around the world are just now discovering the joy of virtual worship, known to more liberal Jews for years. In fact, Zoom Shabbat has some distinct advantages over in-real-life congregation. If a sermon is boring, I’ll hop over to a different one. If I don’t like the voice of one cantor, I’ll close the tab and find another. Attendance is anonymous. No one notices if you show up late or leave early. I’ve dropped into synagogues all over North America.Virtual shul helps me mark the passing of time. Because I no longer drop my kids off to school or ride the subway to work, the days tend blend into each other. Virtual shul helps make Shabbat morning feel special. On Saturdays, we sleep in. My husband works on a cryptic crossword. Mid-morning, I recite Shabbat prayers with other people, just like before the pandemic, only now I don’t dress up or leave the house. I open my laptop at my kitchen table in my yoga pants, or sometimes in bed. My seven-year-old daughter colours beside me, and the two of us sing along to familiar melodies.Something else I like about livestream shul: it can be more intimate than in real life. You’re invited inside the private living rooms and offices of clergy where you can see their art, bookshelves and furniture. When the cantor Julia Cadrain, from Central Synagogue on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, sings from her apartment with a guitar on her lap in front of a wall of hanging plants, I feel like her personal guest. Sometimes her toddler joins her.I avoid the congregations that require Zoom password, which can lead to awkward situations. On a recent Saturday morning, I logged into a service held by Romemu, a progressive congregation on the Upper West Side, and in one of the little Zoom boxes, I saw the face of an old high school friend I hadn’t seen for over 20 years. I wondered if he’d seen me, if my hair looked OK, if I should follow up with an email. Flummoxed, I quickly logged off.If I’m lucky, I’ll stumble upon the bar or bat mitzvah of a stranger. Bar or bat mitzvahs are my preferred genre of reality television in the age of Covid-19. Inevitably, I cry from start to finish. I admire how, in the face of a disappointment, the kid, wearing fancy clothes, in the company of just immediate family, with a scroll placed on a dining room table, found a way to create a meaningful ritual. If she can do that, I think, maybe I can survive this, too. Sometimes the faces of the grandparents are Zoomed in from Florida, their knickknacks proudly displayed on shelves behind them. Captured on the screen is the sadness of the pandemic, the forced separation of grandparents from their grandkids, but it’s also an act of hope: despite the circumstances, the Jewish tradition is being passed from one generation to the next.When this is over, will I go back to attending synagogue in real life, or will my new virtual habit satisfy my needs? I’m not sure. Thousands of years ago, when Judaism shifted from being a temple-based religion to a bunch of communities spread out across the diaspora, synagogue ritual was invented as a kind of placeholder, until the temple in Jerusalem can be rebuilt. What we’re witnessing now is another great adaptation.I still miss my old synagogue. I miss the sound of voices singing together in spontaneous harmony. I miss the drama of the wrapped-up Torah scroll processing up and down the aisle and I miss the warm, wood-walled room that holds many happy memories.

She had been due to host the show on Wednesday night, but the Newsnight reporter Katie Razzall presented it instead.Maitlis later tweeted she had “asked for the night off”.Amid growing criticism of the reprimand, Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, wrote on Twitter that Maitlis “hasn’t been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement”.In the monologue Maitlis told viewers: “Dominic Cummings broke the rules – the country can see that and it’s shocked the government cannot.“The longer ministers and the prime minister insist he worked within them, the more likely the angry response to the scandal is likely to be … He made those who struggled to keep to the rules feel like fools, and has allowed many more to assume they can flout them.”Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement: “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it.”Maitlis finished the programme by telling viewers: “I’ll be back tomorrow.” Clips of the sequence went viral on social media, attracting millions of views – many more than tune in to Newsnight on a typical evening. However, it caused fury among both Conservative politicians who have largely parked their longstanding criticism of the BBC during the pandemic, and also some journalists in and outside the public broadcaster who felt it went against the corporation’s approach to journalism.BBC news bosses agreed with the criticism of its own show, swiftly issuing a statement distancing themselves from the monologue. BBC sources said Newsnight’s editor, Esme Wren, worked on Tuesday night’s episode.“The BBC must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output,” the corporation said in a statement. “We’ve reviewed the entirety of last night’s Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.“As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Our staff have been reminded of the guidelines.”Keith Brown, SNP deputy leader, said:\u0026nbsp“This statement is a gutless capitulation by BBC bosses.\u0026nbspNewsnight should be commended - not slapped down - for\u0026nbsptheir serious investigative work on Cummings, that’s not something you could say about\u0026nbspthe BBC News at 10.\u0026nbsp“Pandering to\u0026nbsp10 Downing Street\u0026nbspby curbing journalists from being able to hold the UK government to account is of serious concern.”\u0026nbspAn SNP spokesperson added: “It’s ironic that the only apology over the whole Dominic Cummings lockdown breaches scandal comes from the BBC.”\u0026nbspMaitlis’s profile, already high, has risen further since she was made lead presenter of the nightly current affairs show last year, shortly after publishing her book Airhead on life as a television presenter. She received global acclaim after confronting Prince Andrew about his connections with the deceased paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In April she had a viral hit with another monologue of hers dismissing the idea that coronavirus is a “great leveller” given its disproportionate impact on poorer people .The BBC has faced heavy criticism over the issue of maintaining impartiality in its news coverage, particularly over its handling of complaints about comments that BBC Breakfast’s presenter Naga Munchetty made about Donald Trump. It also struggled to deal with the enormous levels of criticism from both Labour and the Conservatives during the 2019 general election.• This article was amended on 27 and 28 May 2020.

She later responded to people sending messages of support: “Been overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages – and support on here – and I’ve probably missed much of it. A big thank you from us all at Newsnight.”Newsnight’s policy editor, Lewis Goodall, said he “couldn’t be prouder” to work on the programme alongside the “world-class” Maitlis.The row is another headache for the BBC, which has struggled to enforce its editorial standards codes in the social media era. Increasingly it has found itself forced to apologise by one side of the political debate for an on-air alleged error of judgment, only to be criticised again by the other side for apologising.Although the BBC has enjoyed a brief respite in recent months, Downing Street’s pushback against the media over the Cummings incident suggests normal service is being resumed.Talking of Johnson’s “blind loyalty” in the face of plummeting poll ratings, she expressed bafflement over his loyalty to Cummings in the face of enormous public anger. “The prime minister knows all this and has chosen to ignore it,” she said.The BBC said that while the programme “contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism”, it should have done more “to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3763fefbab75349720a6350987c28db3cfa18fa4/18_174_2747_1649/master/2747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa2ffe43ef7db0eca2e25d281266d868","title":"virgin media to disappear from uk high street coronavirus","story":"Exclusive: firm’s 53 stores will not reopen after lockdown and staff will be offered other rolesVirgin Media is to disappear from the high street after deciding its network of more than 50 retail stores will stay shut once the coronavirus pandemic lockdown ends.The cable and TV company, which operates 53 stores in the UK, is offering the 341 affected staff the opportunity to move to newly created roles.About 300 of those posts will be in customer care, the majority of those based permanently at home, a decision Virgin Media has taken because of the success of its call centre staff moving to a working-from-home environment during the lockdown. Another 50 newly created roles relate mostly to field sales roles.“We are focused on delivering the service customers want, in the ways they want it and at a time and place that suits them,” said Rob Orr, an executive director for sales at Virgin Media. “By creating new jobs in our most popular care and sales channels, we will be better able to provide our customers with the top service and support they rightly expect while retaining our talented workforce.”The coronavirus pandemic has hastened a strategic shift the company was already making – moving away from the high street as more and more sales and customer inquiries were taking place online or over the phone. Virgin Media has whittled down the number of stores and kiosks it operates in the UK from 140 in 2016. In recent years, its rival Sky has also moved to dramatically reduce the number of physical stores it has across the UK.In March, Virgin Media moved to employ 500 new call centre staff in the UK over concerns that the outsourcing of customer calls to offshore workers in countries including India and the Philippines could be interrupted by the spread of the virus.Virgin Media has also moved to directly hire 700 engineers, most of whom were working for the cable company but employed by third-party businesses, to ensure it had the staff numbers to continue to carry out home visits, including installations and repairs.\u0026nbspThe company, which employs 12,000 people, is in the early stages of a merger with the mobile operator O2 to create a new TV, broadband and mobile powerhouse to challenge BT and Sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d999d78c367891690c375cd67573f8726a9916e/33_122_2455_1474/master/2455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b811ae0839abcedc3ff8d13874c11bc7","title":"anywhere but westminster online covid 19 uk","story":"In lockdown, our series is using footage sent in from around the UK to tell the story of the world outside the political bubbleThe day after the 2019 general election we were on an early-morning train from Stoke-on-Trent to London, feeling as if a long and messy chapter of recent British history had at last come to some kind of full stop. Brexit was a certainty, the Conservatives had won a big parliamentary majority, and the Labour party was more estranged than ever from its old heartlands. Having covered a country in mounting political ferment since 2010, we thought we could at least put Anywhere but Westminster on pause.But in March, everything changed once again. As the Covid-19 crisis reached the decisive point of lockdown, we decided the series had to be reawakened. But if we were as subject to the new restrictions as anyone else, and just as scared of the virus, how could we do it?The answer has defined our experience of the past two months. Instead of travelling to places, we have issued call-outs for information about what people are living through, and footage of their lives, usually shot on their phones. In addition, often using contacts we have acquired over the past 10 years, we have approached old and new sources, and asked them to participate. A mountain of video has arrived, which we and our team have spent long days and nights combining with our own material and turning into finished films. The result, by a mixture of accident and design, has been an ongoing series of videos that tells the story of this crisis from the core of people’s actual experience.We’ve chronicled the lives of a 26-year-old man whose arthritis medication suppresses his immune system, meaning he has to live in complete isolation, and an intensive care nurse who facilitates people saying their last goodbyes via Zoom. We’ve spoken to families whose experience of lockdown is light years away from any “bake cakes and learn Spanish” cliches, and people who have spoken movingly about losing loved ones. Crucially, we have also gone out of our way to explore how communities have come together, and provided new kinds of support to friends and neighbours.Unintentionally, it feels like what we’re doing is true to most people’s experience of the crisis – and, in particular, the mixture of an often lonely world suddenly mediated via the internet, and an unexpected sense of common purpose and togetherness. It sometimes feels as if encouraging people to document their own experiences is sparking a change in the way we feel about our journalism, and presenting us with a new challenge we will have to face when the crisis recedes: how to push even further beyond the standard approaches of the media, and give an even more authentic sense of where the country is going.For now, one thing seems particularly clear. The convulsive political events of the past 10 years were at least partly about rising inequality and insecurity, and people’s sense that power was too distant. Covid-19 has highlighted those things to the point that they are even more inescapable than before – which, for us, means that the work has to go on.Stay at home, keep your distance from people and don’t mix with anyone outside of your circle: the rules of lockdown are almost the polar opposite of the rules of Anywhere but Westminster.Our process has been to get out there to places the media doesn’t normally visit, get close to people, and talk to those outside our bubble. Seeing a political media that was too socially distant, we wanted to counteract it with a kind of journalistic gap-closing.Through the ruptures of Corbynism, Brexit, and the rise of populism, the idea that there was a gap between the way politics was presented in the news and lived in the world became accepted, and even a cliche. After 10 years, I sometimes felt like one of an ageing pair of small-time bank robbers, always coming back for one last job.But coronavirus and the resulting lockdown brought us new purpose – or a new version of our old purpose. Once again, the news was dominated by images from government briefings from Westminster and political journalists trying to hold them to account – this time over Zoom. There was also a blizzard of figures: infection rates, deaths, jobs lost, workers in furlough. We wanted to give more space to ordinary people to speak – putting human stories to those numbers and policies, but also capturing the ways in which communities were coming together to help each other.Same old problem, then: the difference is that we are working from our bedrooms and putting the films together using footage sent to us by people around Britain. Like everything else about this moment, it’s been a journey of discovery, with highs and lows. I will not miss wrestling with hundreds of clips shot in different formats, sent to me along with a constant stream of messages, questions, and pinging alerts. But I have also found moments of emotion in the footage that it would be hard to match in anything I shot myself.A paradox has become clear: while the issues we cover have always been bottom-up, the process of making a film that has a narrative viewers will watch and engage with is a very top-down process, requiring lots of control in the hands of the person filming and editing. Normally we videographers film with great attention to detail, trying to get each shot just right, and capturing every aspect of a scene in sequences of shots. Now I’m in collaboration with people who don’t even hold the camera the right way round (hint: it’s not vertical). But what they lack in technical skills they have made up for in authenticity.So, in many ways, this has been a process of letting go – of the old standards that we thought were so important, and of the visual “grammar” we have taken for granted. Instead we have found value in a new kind of intimacy and sincerity that comes from people having filmed their own stories, and the greater sense of control they have in the process. And we have tried to lay open the process to the viewers. In some ways this version of Anywhere but Westminster is the most true to its original vision. Hopefully it will open up new ways of thinking about how we do our video journalism and share power with the people we report on, and at the same time encourage people to see the power in capturing and documenting these times in video for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60efe287d1477c1d28411ae3f6dc099a6841771/83_0_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f18b0acf514602c15e6b0036683204a","title":"what are your experiences of debt during the coronavirus pandemic","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how they are managing existing debts during the coronavirus pandemicSince the lockdown thousands of people have found themselves grappling with significantly reduced finances.

Speaking to Smash Hits around the time of Don’t You Want Me’s release and subsequent rise to the top of the charts in 1981, Human League singer Phil Oakey enthused: “It’s the best song I’ve ever written. It’s a proper song like the kind that Earth, Wind and Fire or Abba would write.” Producer Martin Rushent claimed that Oakey actually hated the eventual hit so much that he tried to stop it being released. Whatever the truth of the matter, Oakey’s public pronouncements were correct – this is aspirational music that chimed with the times yet had none of the ruthless, cynical avarice of the decade, and pop, to come.Don’t You Want Me was to crown the breakout year for electronic pop music – Soft Cell had hit the top of the charts in the same year as the Human League, but Tainted Love had the sneaky advantage of being a cover. Depeche Mode were bubbling up in Basildon, OMD had released the arch yet sumptuous Architecture and Morality, but with 2m record sales, the 1981 Christmas No 1 under its belt, and a US No 1 to boot, Don’t You Want Me is arguably the first synth-pop smash hit.Yet it was one that nearly never happened, even without Oakey’s alleged attempts to block it. After two moderately well received albums of hip, Kraftwerk-inspired post-punk austerity, founding Human Leaguers Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh had departed in 1980 to form Heaven 17. “Director of visuals” Philip Wright and singer Phil Oakey – a man with an asymmetric fringe so extravagant it looked as if it was making a bid for freedom under his elbow – were left with the name, and also the group’s debts to label Virgin.In need of a bigger lineup to fulfil tour commitments and pay off some of the money owed, Oakey brought in two teenagers he had seen dancing in Sheffield’s Crazy Daisy nightclub to take on the road as backing singers. The addition of best friends Joanne Catherall and Susan Anne Sulley might have looked like an act of desperation, but it ended up proving a masterstroke. It changed the dynamic of the band and Sulley’s vocals made Don’t You Want Me the hit it became. Pushed to the limits of their musical abilities, Wright and Oakey recruited an actual musician, keyboard player Ian Burden, and went into the studio with Rushent. Reflecting on the aims of the newly rehabilitated Human League, Oakey said: “We wanted an album full of singles, like a Michael Jackson or Abba LP … we’ve moved away from textures to tunes. It’s tunes every time.”He wasn’t wrong. Blessed not only with a solid gold chorus but also a synth bass riff and more hooks than the long line of a Cornish mackerel fisherman, Don’t You Want Me is one of those brilliant, breezy songs that carries a twisted subtext, taking subversion to the top of the charts. While most who heard the song might have perceived it as a lament between two lovers in a relationship that’s no longer firing, Oakey said that it’s instead “a nasty song about sexual power politics”. He plays the character of a svengali who appears to be warning the starlet he plucked from obscurity in the cocktail bar of the opening line that if she doesn’t continue their romantic relationship, her career is over, or maybe worse. In the age of #MeToo and the exposure of exploitative practices in the music industry, Don’t You Want Me is lyrically more relevant now than when it first caused a stir in 1981.Given the subject matter of the song, the presence of these two young women plucked from obscurity to find stardom was hardly going to go unnoticed, and the tabloids duly had a field day, speculating that the waitress from the cocktail bar was either or both of them. Catherall and Sulley constantly found themselves under misogyny-laden attack from press and industry alike. In a happier counterpoint to the complex sexual power play of the song’s lyrics, Oakey always stuck up for his colleagues and the decision to put them on a proper salary. In a 1986 NME interview, he blasted their detractors: “The musos have never liked them, they’ve never understood them. There’s no one sounds like Joanne and Susan. They make it a Human League record.”Don’t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth pop coming in from the cold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eb6918fad719d74c29cfce407b182bf7162582c/0_136_4089_2453/master/4089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b1f6798d055eb8cf8d516227fdd916d","title":"cummings and not goings","story":"The prime minister’s senior adviser has provoked national outrage by admitting travelling hundreds of miles to stay with family at the height of coronavirus lockdown. ’s Matthew Weaver reveals how he helped break the storyDominic Cummings has given his version of the events that have dominated the news for the past five days.

It will start at 11.30am rather than 2.30pm to debate a government motion on how to proceed.In a letter to MPs the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, said he had agreed to the government plan: “Now that I have agreed to a recall on Tuesday, it is for the government to decide what proposal for voting it wishes to put forward.“I have been clear to the government and to opposition parties that I would prefer cross-party agreement to be reached about the way in which the house should conduct its proceedings when the house returns, including on how isions should take place.”Hoyle said the PHE advice on voting had changed, and it was clear that “the house simply cannot conduct isions safely via the lobbies”.He wrote: “There are pinch points in the lobbies where MPs are recorded by clerks and counted by tellers where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing, even though perspex booths were prepared for two of the ision desks.” Such votes would also risk taking longer than allowed under parliamentary proceedings, he added.Hoyle said that if the government and opposition were unable to agree a way forward, he would allow amendments to the government motion for new procedures.Valerie Vaz, the shadow Commons leader, said it was the “latest example of the government in chaos”. She said: “Jacob Rees-Mogg tried to abolish the hybrid remote parliament, which allowed all MPs to take part regardless of their personal circumstances, without any prior notice and against all advice on the last day parliament met.\u0026nbsp“He has bungled it and is now forcing parliament to return early solely to correct his earlier discriminatory move.”Pete Wishart, the Cabinet Office spokesman for the SNP, tweeted: “The government wants us to come back to a parliament that can’t work. An absolute joke.”A Commons debate on resuming physical sittings before the recess heard concerns from a series of MPs. The former Conservative minister Robert Halfon said the proposals would discriminate and threaten the lives of some MPs.“Is it really morally just to say in effect to MPs, because you are not Tarzan-like and able to swing through the chamber, beating your chest shouting to your constituents: ‘Look, I am here!’ that you are effectively euthanised from the Commons?” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d193cafe03cb28e7d6b0afb142d84d7e5a1e2ecc/0_20_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5a25c53e848dd3e8915b1f8ddcedf6","title":"lgbtq community how have you been affected by the lockdown","story":"We would like to hear from LGBTQ+ people about their experiences during the pandemicWhile the pandemic lockdown has raised significant concerns for everyone, we want to know whether it has brought additional difficulties for the LGBTQ+ community.Being able to embrace your sexuality or gender identity has a positive impact on wellbeing and resilience.

We await confirmation from the government that this will be permitted even though it may be that the resumption of international cricket has not been at the top of its list of priorities of late.Meanwhile in the offices of the England and Wales Cricket Board and the International Cricket Council the details of the necessary protocols for playing a Test in such extraordinary times are being finalised. They must try to anticipate every eventuality although the guidelines may not include mandatory 60-mile journeys as an eyesight test for umpires. Among many other precautions, a plan of action is needed should any of the players be laid low with the virus during a game.Such plans may well spawn a new category of cricketer, “the Covid sub”. If there was a widespread outbreak, no doubt the medical experts would have to abandon the match or the series. But if an inidual player tested positive then they would be isolated immediately and could easily be replaced by a Covid sub. This would not be a trailblazing change but merely an extension of the concussion substitute regulation introduced to English domestic cricket in 2018 and then adopted by the ICC in July 2019.There have been six instances of a concussion sub in international cricket so far and the most memorable – at least for English and Australian fans – was the first. On 18 August last year Marnus Labuschagne strode out to bat at Lord’s as a concussion sub for Steve Smith, who had been hit on the head by a Jofra Archer bouncer in Australia’s first innings.The regulations require “a like-for-like” replacement, which is difficult to satisfy when the concussed player is the uniquely gifted Smith, but Labuschagne was a batsman who bowled a few leg-breaks so there could be no complaints. In the final innings of the match with early wickets tumbling, Labuschagne, in what would be his sixth appearance in a hitherto modest Test career, batted for two and a quarter hours while making a polished 59 and the game was saved. He had to stay in the Test side after that.There were three more half-centuries for Labuschagne in the Ashes series and last winter in Australia he amassed scores of 185, 162, 143 and 215 in Tests against Pakistan and New Zealand. But for the concussion sub regulation it is possible that Labuschagne, who averages 63 in Test cricket, might still be waiting for his recall.Until his appearance with bat in hand at Lord’s, substitutes could only field or – with the opposing captain’s permission – keep wicket in Test cricket. They could not bat or bowl. Indeed cricket remains just about the only team sport that does not embrace the liberal use of substitutes – with good reason.One of the delights of the game is the delicious balancing act every captain has to undertake when selecting his final XI. Of course they want that extra batsmanbowler to cover any situation but must choose which way to go before the start of the match and live with that often agonising decision thereafter.In 2005 – for one year only – tactical substitutes were allowed in one-day international cricket. Vikram Solanki became the first “super sub” on 7 July at Headingley when he replaced Simon Jones after 31 overs of the first innings of a match between England and Australia. It was a very poor idea, which was reckoned to favour the team winning the toss as well as removing the captain’s perennial dilemma and the authorities had the good sense to ditch it quickly.Over the years there has been a better case for the use of substitutes as a consequence of ill-health and injury, though this would have denied us epic tales such as Lancashire’s Eddie Paynter getting out of his hospital bed, while still suffering from tonsillitis, and hitting a valiant 83 in the enervating heat of Brisbane, an innings that ensured an England victory in the Bodyline series of 1932-33.There have been several instances since of England sides being stricken with stomach problems in the subcontinent when the use of substitutes would have been handy – on one occasion this almost prompted a Test debut for Henry Blofeld on the 1963-64 tour of India (he was reporting for the  at the time).More recently a bug tore through a chunk of the England team during the first Test at Centurion in South Africa last December but no replacements were possible once the match had started, unless a player was deemed by the medics to be concussed. This raised an obvious question: should substitutes now be allowed when a batsman breaks a finger or a bowler becomes injured – like Jimmy Anderson in the first Ashes Test of 2019? What is the difference between a badly torn calf muscle and a bang on the head?My instincts are that we should be wary of expanding the use of substitutes in cricket. It might become another source of chicanery prompting a few bogus injuries along the way. I might permit the reintroduction of runners for injured batsmen, since this is so often a source of entertaining chaos and is consequently rarely used by sides seeking to gain an advantage.As for Covid subs, I would definitely allow them at a time when the authorities and their cricketers are busting a gut to provide us with some international cricket, however bizarre and forlorn the surroundings. I just hope they will never be needed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085b0f9e284e01edbc98b28bf7f1e68f8a5a4291/0_67_4095_2457/master/4095.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe83451c4229570db63f4630e7ca7e01","title":"larry kramer life in pictures","story":"The playwright, author and activist Larry Kramer has died aged 84 after a storied life.

Your visit to us may be different from usual, because there are a few things we need everyone to do to help us keep places open safely,” wrote membership director Tom North.“To open these gardens and parklands safely, we’ve had to reduce the number of people we can welcome at one time, so you’ll need to book in advance.

The permitted length of visits varies from site to site, and will be specified on the booking form. The trust is requesting all visitors to book only one slot a week, and is encouraging only key workers and their families to book the first and last time slots each day.Some of the first grounds to open include: the gardens and woodland estate at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, home to dukes and earls for more than 300 years with grounds sloping down to the River Thames Northumberland’s 17th-century Wallington Hall, with its farmland and secret walled garden the Ickworth estate in Suffolk, with ancient woods and formal gardens around an Italianate palace and Castle Ward near Strangford Lough, with its Temple Water lake and elaborate Victorian gardens.English Heritage, which manages more than 400 other historic sites, says it is finalising reopening plans and aims to open some staffed sites from early July. Around 200 of its free-to-enter sites are already open, including sections of Hadrian’s Wall, the Westbury White Horse in Wiltshire, Bayard’s Cove Fort in Devon, the Iron Bridge in Shropshire and the ruins of Bowes Castle in County Durham.The Woodland Trust is keeping access to its woodlands under review but saysall sites “remain open to everyone, every day”.

It was the day my brother and I rode mountain bikes down from the Shandur Pass in northern Pakistan – we’d taken our time and were too late to look for somewhere to camp, so the truck stop provided bed and board. Total price about £2, including paratha and green tea for breakfast. No precise location and definitely no website. But the memory lives on as one of the best meals of my life.Fiona NeallWe found Cervecería Varadero in Tarifa – it’s listed as a fishmonger rather than a restaurant on Google – while on a whale-watching holiday. It looks very ordinary from the outside, but the fish is just incredible. It only opens at lunchtime and appears to be staffed by the fishermen who’ve caught that day’s offerings. It’s where I had, for the first time, deep-fried ortigas de mar (sea anemones) and tortillitas de camarones – the most amazing little shrimp fritters, a local speciality (pictured). There’s usually a queue but it’s so worth the wait. This is the place I’ve been looking for on every holiday I’ve been on, and I can’t wait to go back. AlisonWe were recommended a seafood restaurant in an octagonal building at the port, where the trawlers unloaded. After we’d tried about 15 types of seafood, a massive storm struck and the plastic coverings were lowered. After about 30 minutes of downpour, with water pouring through the ceiling, the waiter (who’d been drinking out of his own bottle) brought over another bottle of wine and said, “It’s free until the rain stops.” An hour and another eight types of seafood later, he brought us another bottle and said, “Nobody’s going home tonight.” This sounded a bit ominous at the time, but three hours later the rain eased up, we tipped generously and finally left. Marvellous!Will RoscoeOur ryokan hosts in Kyoto recommended Shoraian to us. Having navigated a bamboo grove and monkey forest, we arrived at a picture-perfect tiny restaurant beside the Katsura river. Removing our shoes, we were led to our own private dining room and seated on the floor. The restaurant specialises in tofu and we were presented with a succession of exquisitely presented courses on an array of different crockery: creamed, gratinated, chilled, steamed, grilled and boiled tofu. The only break from the seemingly endless stream of delicious soy curd was a stunning wagyu course, the beef marbled and truly melt-in-your-mouth. Such a memorable experience! • shoraian, about £60 a headPaulIgnoring for a second the idyllic riverside location, with the breeze cutting through the humidity of night, the lamb peka at Konavoski Dvori restaurant, 20 miles south of Dubrovnik, was quite simply the most delicious lamb I’ve ever eaten. It’s like a Sunday roast where the meat has spent the past two years doing nothing but lifting weights and eating avocados. It’s cooked with potatoes (which absorb the lamb fat in a most agreeable manner) in a charcoal fire-pit, covered by a large, bell-shaped iron lid. You have to order it in advance, but my lord it’s the sort of thing to remember and get emotional about. • esculaprestaurantsJames McPhunKuching, Borneo. Fried banana slices covered in thick batter with shredded cheese melting on top – served in a little red plastic basket lined with a thin napkin. We screw up our faces at the sight of it before shrugging and ing in with little pink plastic forks, creating unsaid margins for our own sections. It’s crunchy and soft. Sweet and savoury. Salty and creamy. All at the same damn time. The humidity is causing my hair to curl around my face as I chew, the riverside breeze sweeping across my collarbone as I reach in for more. The unfamiliar chatter of the locals surrounds us as we gabble in English about how much we adore this. I close my eyes to savour each sensation. “We’re ordering another one, right?”MaryThe sign at the multicoloured roadside shack outside the town of Sagua la Grande said, “Best Pina Coladas in the World.” We were cycling and stopped: “Two of your finest please.” With a flourish, the gnarly old proprietor, cigar stogie in his mouth, put a coconut, a pineapple, a bucket of ice and a bottle of rum on to his makeshift counter. He handed me a massive machete and with a tobacco-stained grin said “Help yourself!” We smoked cigars and drank with Carlos all day … and returned to Colón late, our bikes balanced on the back of his rusty old pick-up. Simon TobinThis week, six readers tipped this place! Ed. Travelling around Scotland by campervan, we came to the small village of Balnakeil, on the northern tip of the British mainland, close to the sea. Actually it felt a bit like the (most beautiful) end of the world. Fields, sheep, narrow roads and a cold wind, though sunny. And in this middle of nowhere, we found these chocolate makers called Cocoa Mountain. I will never forget this unbelievably creamy, sweet hot chocolate, which I sipped from a big mug on their porch. I have never had a better hot chocolate in my life. And I’m over 50. I took some chocolate powder home, and some of their delicious truffles. I would travel all the way from Germany again just for them, especially the chilli lemongrass ones!StephanieMy favourite food memory was on the journey back from the Spiti Valley in the Indian Himalayas. My boyfriend and I had been motorbiking around India for several months and had experienced many pitfalls. On our way down this mountain the only road was blocked by landslides. Trucks had been gridlocked for days. A group of truckers saw us and invited us over to eat with them. Using a portable stove they made a meal from the supplies they were transporting. We ate the most delicious tarka dal and rice, followed by handfuls of fresh snow peas from the truck. They even provided rum!Tabitha WardOne of the best meals I ever had was in a restaurant in Sanaa, the largest city in Yemen.

She sees things from the “customer experience” and is passionate about getting it right, one source said.She is one of the most high-profile women involved in the coronavirus response, and it is likely the health secretary, Matt Hancock, will look to her to provide the details and direction of the scheme, which has endured a bumpy journey so far.Hancock faced weeks of criticism for the government’s decision to abandon initial contact tracing efforts on 12 March.Harding confidently presented the rules and “new principles”, as Hancock described it, in her first appearance at the Downing Street press conference, drawing a line under past efforts.Such was her confidence in the new strategy – which involves 25,000 contact tracers – she said: “If anything I’m worried that many of my brilliant contact tracers are not going to be very busy as we start to encourage more people to get a test.” She said there were “easily enough to trace down the contacts today when the vast majority of us are in lockdown”. The Isle of Wight contact, track and trace app trial provides a major challenge. Beset by delays, a version of the app has yet to be rolled out nationwide.Harding was made a peer in 2014 by David Cameron. Just a year later she was at the eye of the storm in the TalkTalk hacking scandal in which the details of 156,959 customers – including names, emails and phone numbers – and 15,000 bank account numbers were accessed by hackers with the company receiving a record £400,000 fine from the information commissioner.About 18 months later she resigned saying she wanted to focus on “more activities in public service”.She is married to John Penrose, a Tory MP and former minister, and has previously worked in management for Sainsbury’s and Tesco.

All they’ve been told is to have a plan in place by the end of June,” he said.The call was organised for MPs by Nadine Dorries, the junior health minister - who accused Bradshaw of making a “disappointing misinterpretation”. Councils, Dorries tweeted, already have pre-existing plans “to deal with outbreaks of local infections, and whilst they worked on developing local outbreak management plans for Covid 19 they would be deployed”.Contact tracers working in the national network were unable to log in to the newly launched track-and-trace systems on Thursday after a critical IT incident.An email seen by the  was sent to clinical staff by the contact centre company Sitel that read: “We are aware of a CTAS login issue for NHS professionals this has been reported as a critical incident.”One worker said: “Yesterday I got two emails with links to log on to the contact-tracing system.

As of 8am I still could not get in and had no response.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “As withall -large scale operations of this kind, some staff did initially encounter issues logging on to their systems and these are rapidly being resolved.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b367f31e7e58bba68bb452594cca2bc8bcb61475/0_22_3171_1903/master/3171.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=109c3638fcdd7a7c95f5befdb2205430","title":"us funding website spreading covid 19 disinformation","story":"State Department-backed Armenian project to promote democracy instead features false informationThe US government is funding a website in Armenia which is spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, including warnings that Armenians ought to “refuse” future vaccine programmes.The website, Medmedia.am, was launched with the help of a US State Department grant meant to promote democracy, but instead has been used to promote false information about Covid-19, according to an investigation by the British news website openDemocracy.Among Medmedia’s most popular articles are pieces that have called Covid-19 a “fake pandemic” and falsely reported that a morgue offered to pay hundreds of dollars to a dead patient’s family if they claimed the death had been caused by the coronavirus.The grant was awarded by the State Department to a group called the Armenian Association of Young Doctors, which launched the website last year and is led by a controversial doctor called Gevorg Grigoryan.He has been known for his strong criticism of the government’s health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in 2014 in which he called for gay people to be burned.This week, the group’s official Facebook page claimed that the government led by prime minister Nikol Pashinyan, who led a nonviolent reform movement before his election, had “completely failed the fight” against coronavirus. Grigoryan said he was not aligned with a specific political party and denied that Medmedia or the fact-finding project were political fronts aimed at opposing the government.“If we look at everything from a political point of view then we’re not going to go very far,” he said. “But from an expert point of view, the statistics speak for themselves.”Armenia has reported about 7,100 coronavirus cases and a rising rate of infections. The country has also grappled with a drop in childhood vaccine rates, which the health minister, Arsen Torosyan, has blamed on anti-vaccine propaganda.The State Department declined to comment on questions about the size of the grant or its review process.A post on the US embassy’s website in Armenia said grants under the Democracy Commission Small Grants Program – which are worth up to $50,000 – are awarded on a competitive basis to local NGOs and are meant to focus on issues like transparency and accountability in governance, advancing human rights, eliminating corruption, and enhancing economic growth and development.But the openDemocracy investigation found that, while Medmedia had published some news articles, most of its opinion pieces were republished Facebook posts that spread false information.Grigoryan told the  that the US embassy in Armenia had contacted him with “concerns” about op-eds and articles on the site. But, he said: “I am sure I was able to answer all those questions and those concerns disappeared. The site is not an anti-vaccine forum.”He would not say how much money was given to his Armenian Association for Young Doctors by the US embassy, or how much of that was invested in the website. He called it a “small amount” and addressed questions on specifics to the US embassy.

He said:I was advised if my normal mode of transport was the train I should use that but should isolate and keep myself to myself, which is what I did.He said he self-isolated at home for seven days and his illness was short-lived.He also told the Northern Echo that while some might have said he should have stayed in London:Was I meant to move into a hotel? Was I supposed to go back to the flat of another MP when I had nothing apart from a couple of changes of clothes?Did I run the risk of potentially infecting the friend whose flat it was?David McWilliams is a consultant physiotherapist helping ICU patients recover from Covid-19 – this powerful film follows their recovery from the moment they first open their eyes since arriving to their first steps. His team support patients at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital, which has one of the largest critical care units in Europe and recently was treating more than 200 Covid-19 patients at one time.Durham’s former chief constable Mike Barton said he believes the force statement used the word “might” in relation to Dominic Cummings breaking the regulations as the police could not be seen to be acting as judge and jury.It seems to me that any reasonable observer would see that Mr Cummings has not only broken the spirit of the rules, but also the letter.This is not Durham in the dock - they are still trying to deal with a national emergency - and this will have been an unwelcome distraction and one they have now dealt with, and they would want the public in the North East to observe the rules, unlike Mr Cummings.Explaining why he believed the force used the word “might” in its statement, he said: The police do not want to have been the judge and jury in this, not having interviewed him under caution.They make it clear, this is something of a minor matter in the grand scheme of things, which it is, should he not have been at the centre of the legislation.And that presents him with a problem. But, frankly, he’s too weak to do anything about it.I don’t think he’s going to do anything because he cannot, it seems, continue without his adviser.A lawyer has said Durham Constabulary’s statement that there “might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention” regarding the trip Dominic Cummings took to Barnard Castle could be interpreted as meaning there was enough evidence to suggest he breached the rules but it was ultimately for a court to decide.Raj Chada, head of the criminal defence department and a partner at firm Hodge Jones \u0026amp Allen, told the PA news agency: The police should not be there to decide one way or another whether he actually breached the rules - in this case that could be for the courts to decide - so I interpret this statement as them saying that there is enough evidence to say that he breached the rules (but ultimately for court to decide) but that it is not in public interest to prosecute for the reasons that they say.Asked about the latest statement from Durham police on Dominic Cummings at her press briefing, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said:I think Dominic Cummings should no longer be in post. I certainly continue to think that. That is a matter for the prime minister. I think if the prime minister is putting the integrity of the vital public health message that he and all of us are seeking to communicate first then he will take action that means Dominic Cummings doesn’t continue to distract from that. I think it is wrong that he puts his political interests ahead of those public health interests.The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the prison estate continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures show.To date, there have been 22 prisoners and nine staff known to have contracted Covid-19 and died.There are about 80,200 prisoners in 117 prisons in England and Wales, while there are around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons.The Prison Service is running a highly restrictive regime to curb the spread of the virus, which includes a ban on visits and increased time in cells.

Photograph Nick Bradshaw A debate has been happening in recent days on whether the recommended two metres of physical distancing with others to avoid the spread of the coronavirus can be reduced safely to one metre.So what is the current guidance in Ireland?The public health advice the State’s National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is that people should maintain a distance of two metres to avoid the spread of Covid-19. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said at the weekend “there is no change” to the two-metre rule.Why is this?HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said on Sunday the two-metre distance was based on the projected distance that a droplet containing the virus can spread to another person through cough and sneezing. The decision to maintain a two-metre distance was the reason, he said, why the reproduction rate in the speed of the virus had fallen to the point where it is now suppressed. So who wants it reduced to one metre?Some Government ministers and other politicians. There was a debate at Cabinet last Friday evening about whether the recommended distance should be reduced to one metre as it would make it easier for people in education, healthcare and other areas of work and could help businesses such as restaurants reopen more quickly.Would it help the health service?Yes, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said that it would help the health service treat more patients and create “significantly extra capacity” across the HSE in emergency departments, waiting rooms and other areas if the recommended distance was one metre. What’s the international advice?The World Health Organisation considers a one-metre distance between people to be safe. So what level of protection does this provide?WHO’s special envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, said that two metres “keeps you safe 99 per cent of the time but you can greatly reduce risk even at one metre because 70 per cent of the droplets will stick within one metre.”What other international advice is there?The European Centre for Disease Control still advises people to maintain a distance of two metres, while in the US, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises people to stay “at least six feet” - about two metres - apart.Has there been similar differing views among public health specialists in Ireland?Yes, NPHET’s expert advisory group said in March that there was a “lack of evidence in distinguishing between one and two metres.” Dr Cillian de Gascun, chairman of the group and director of the UCD’s National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that in some circumstances such as in healthcare and domestic settings where it is not possible or practical to maintain two metres distance “the recommendation is that at least one metre but ideally two metres are maintained between people, especially in the context of keeping distance from symptomatic iniduals.”Are there other views out there in Ireland?Yes, the State’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre advised healthcare workers in March to maintain a physical distance of at least one metre but ideally two from iniduals with respiratory symptoms in suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases. In another guidance note advising how to minimise the risk of transmission in pharmacies on March 16th, the HPSC said that “if a healthcare worker can maintain a distance of one metre from the patient’s mouth and nose, they are not within the likely range of droplet transmission. This helps protect both.”Are there risks by moving back to one metre?Yes. Infectious diseases expert Prof Sam McConkey said that moving closer to one another would “inevitably lead to more transmission of Covid-19” and that a one-metre limit could result in “up to four times more transmission.” He described the decision being a “political choice.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Brian Hayes says those who apply for relief after June 30th will \u0026lsquofall into another category\u0026rsquoJudge seeks clarity on admissions during pandemic after 15 facilities unable to accept womanNorth\u0026rsquos health service \u0026lsquowill never be the same again\u0026rsquo, says Minister Robin SwannPriests were contacted by Dublin Archdiocese and reminded of their responsibilitiesNTA asks local authorities to consider making streets pedestrian-onlyMan with mental health conditions living in appalling squalor, HSE tells courtFianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says he resents claims that people on pandemic benefit \u0026lsquogaming the system\u0026rsquoJudge says gang involved in murder, drug and weapon trafficking as Mark Capper sentenced\u0026lsquoWe\u0026rsquore asking you to keep the public health advice in mind, whatever your plans\u0026rsquoIrish Human Rights and Equality Commission warns department over \u0027school profiling\u0027 concernsReducing rules from two- to one-metre will still curtail school capacityData shows mortality rate in some homes as proportion of occupancy above 40 per centSurvey by Barnardos finds sibling rows, pent up energy and loss of routine creating issuesWarm and sunny weather is expected to last over the June bank holiday weekendCivil liberties group voices concern over mandatory passenger locator formHospital group still providing daily \u0026lsquohealth check\u0026rsquo to Dealgan House nursing homeExiled drug dealer known as \u0026lsquoThe Penguin\u0026rsquo believed to be owner of the moneyHSE statistics offer insight into 1,030 deaths across 167 residential facilitiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4264681.1590658125!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures could reach 28 degrees today ahead of sunny bank holiday weekend","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTemperatures on Thursday could reach as high as 28 degrees, with the warm and sunny weather expected to last for the June bank holiday weekend, Met Éireann has said.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe .Proposals on the future of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) will be brought forward “over the next week or so”, Minister for Social Protection Regina Doherty has said.Introducing revised financial estimates for her department, which is seeking an additional €6.8 billion to cover the weekly €350 payments and a wage subsidy scheme, Ms Doherty said she was happy to confirm again that the payments would extend beyond the original June end date.“Any future decisions will be based on our commitment that everyone who needs help will get the most appropriate assistance and also based on the evidence we receive from the reopening of the economy,” she said.The Minister added that “we are currently considering this and intend to bring forward proposals for some changes over the next week or so”.A call had been made for people to be given certainty about the future of the payment and wage subsidy scheme as the Dáil debated the revised estimates.Fianna Fáil social protection spokesman Willie O’Dea warned that there should not be a “cliff edge” drop from €350 to the €205 paid as jobseeker’s allowance.He said he could not believe that approval was being sought for €6.84 billion of social welfare payments “but without any information whatsoever about the future” of the PUP.‘Gaming the system’Mr O’Dea said he resented recent references to 200,000 people who are apparently being better off while receiving the payment than working. He criticised allegations that they were “gaming the system” and lying on the couch watching TV rather than going back to work.He said 40 per cent of those on the payment had previously been earning €300 or less and the “vast majority” were working part time.Mr O’Dea said those talking about PUP recipients being better off “are blissfully unaware that the Government has clearly signalled that if the pandemic payment exceeds their earnings there will be a clawback”.Ms Doherty said that while there was fraud in the system in the same as every country, it was small numbers in this case.“There is nobody gaming the system and nobody will lose their payment,” she said, adding that the payments would not suddenly be “ripped away”.The Minister said she was seeking approval for the additional funds, which would bring the estimate for her department to more than €28 billion for the year. She said the extraordinary events brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic meant the original estimate “will no longer be sufficient to cover the expenditure of the department”.Much earlierShe said given the scale of the “exceptional measures” needed in response to the pandemic “we will within the next week or so, reach the ceiling” when 80 per cent of allocated funding would be used up. This was happening “much earlier in the year than we could have considered possible a few months ago”, she said.Ms Doherty said the funding was not just for “payments related to the pandemic but also to all of our ordinary payments - child benefit, pensions, carers’ payments, payments to lone parents, payments to people with disabilities and much more besides”.“As we gradually move through the phases of reopening our society, we do need to review the nature of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment and how it fits into cross-Government plans to keep Ireland healthy and get the country working again,” she said.CategoriesThe Dáil heard there are 13 different categories of expenditure related to Covid-19 which give rise to the requirement for the additional €6.8 billion. The PUP and wage subsidy scheme would cost €4.3 billion up to June 12th and jobseeker’s related benefits would costs nearly €4.2 billion for the year, Ms Doherty said.The Minister said the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance costing an additional €98.9 million while enhanced illness benefit to for Covid-related illness or self-isolation was estimated at €74 million.Rent supplement is projected to cost an extra €70 million, increased spending on redundancy is estimated at €44.5 million and insolvency costs are estimated at €8.9 million. Four additional weeks of fuel allowance in March and April cost €34 million and €5.5 million has been provided for 1,000 additional places on the community employment and Tús schemes.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Move paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandPolice fire tear gas in popular shopping district as protesters take to the streets\u0026lsquoThere is a political virus spreading in United States,\u0026rsquo says China\u0026rsquos foreign ministerWinds gusting up to 210kmh expected near iron ore producing heartland of the PilbaraInvestigation begins into cause of Pakistan International Airlines crash that killed 97Officials confirm two survivors after PIA aircraft crashes in residential area of KarachiOutrage among pro-democracy legislators at security law put forward at National People\u0026rsquos CongressRescue teams hampered by torn-down power lines and flooding over large tracts of landPro-Beijing politicians are pushing contentious laws in the face of intense oppositionCyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Former cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayAccident in which 15 wounded takes place during training exercise in Gulf of OmanFormation of coalition to proceed after supreme court clears way for PM to remain in officePolitics and ision facilitate virus in country with just 208 ventilators and scant testingPresident fears country\u0026rsquos 44 cases and three deaths could \u0026lsquosuddenly spike in few days or weeks\u0026rsquoResidents in Mosul, still traumatised by violence, fear a resurgence of the terror groupRuling against Likud chief would likely trigger snap election, the fourth since April 2019Accelerating economic meltdown has left country\u0026rsquos poorest without work and incomeStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Tired of the relentless negativity of the news cycle? Bored of endlessly cynical mainstream broadcasters?Then this is the podcast you’ve been looking for: Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.Yet Pearson and Halligan have much in common. They both boast high-level political access – and lace politics into their writing, although rarely from a “Westminster village” perspective. They both have older children and, unlike so many London-centric journalists, live outside the M25.What unites them, above all, is that Pearson and Halligan are staunchly and proudly “normal” – both hailing from unflashy, proletarian, non-professional backgrounds, the first in their respective families to go to university. That’s one reason they share a reputation for shrewd political analysis and trend-spotting - knowing in their bones, often before the Westminster crowd, how “ordinary people” think.“You know that moment when you’re watching a TV panel discussion and finally – finally! – someone says something you agree with,” says Pearson. “That’s what Planet Normal is all about!”Pearson and Halligan have between them spent almost forty years penning national newspaper columns, winning countless awards for their writing and broadcasting. They both feel strongly that the media is now far less representative of the broader UK population than when they started out.“It’s become much harder in recent years for people from ordinary backgrounds to break into high-end journalism,” says Halligan. “We\u0027ve made progress in terms of gender and ethnic ersity, but there’s now far less ersity in terms of opinion – with much of the broadcast media, in particular, dominated by privileged insiders holding the same approved views”.Planet Normal is a small but spirited attempt to counter that. In their 30-minute weekly podcast, Pearson and Halligan will review the news in the same sharp, irreverent, down-to-earth style they bring to their writing. The emphasis will be on calling out pomposity, lifting the lid on reality and countering political spin.And, on their trips to Planet Normal, Pearson and Halligan will be bringing along fabulous guests for the ride, representing all parts of the news cosmos – from politics to showbiz, from finance to culture – while responding to questions from Planet Normal listeners.Planet Normal - because some journalists are normal people too.To make sure you never miss an episode, subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, or search \u0027Planet Normal\u0027 on your podcast app.Join Liam Halligan and Allison Pearson in the comments section of this article at 1pm (BST) today to discuss their new podcast and more.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"love blooms time coronavirus borders open","story":"Ulla Lundgaard was relaxing in front of the television with her long-term German boyfriend Andreas when Denmark\u0027s Prime Minister dropped the bombshell that would tear their lives apart.It was unbelievable -- you are sitting on the couch on Friday evening listening to a speech by your prime minister and she’s saying \u0027we’re shutting down the border tomorrow morning,\u0027 the 50-year-old remembered. My whole world broke down.The couple, who have been together since 2003, met because each runs their own, separate container businesses, Ulla on the Danish island of Funen, and Andreas in Hamburg.Andreas drove back to Hamburg the next day, leaving Ms Lundgaard to host her 50th birthday party alone three days later.On Tuesday he was finally able to return after the Danish government on Monday eased its strict border rules.Since this Monday the girlfriends and boyfriends of Danish residents have been allowed to cross the border, so long as they live in Germany or another Nordic country, have been in a relationship for at least six months, the relationship has involved regular face-to-face meetings, and they are able to document the relationship with emails, text messages, photos, letters or other evidence.He arrived at the border carrying a letter from Ms Lundgaard, a copy of her will leaving him her money, and copies of their emails, ready to show them to the waiting guard.Now back in Denmark, Andreas says the experience of returning has been amazing and unreal at the same time.  He added: Everybody’s all of a sudden thinking that corona has gone and therefore no need of taking care of each other any longer! We are so afraid that this will result in the border closing again, simply because some people are just too stupid or ignorant to understand or accept the new rules in our society”It is a dilemma faced by many across the world: how can love survive in a time of coronavirus lockdowns?Ms Lundgaard is most angry about the government\u0027s decision to previously let in only married partners.He talks, reads and writes Danish now, he’s part of the local fitness club, all his clothes, his shaving gear, and all his things are here, she complained. Denmark is like his home.I think it\u0027s unfair to say, \u0027if you’re married you can come, but if you’re a boyfriend you can’t come. The government is treating our life partners as tourists.”But Andreas is more supportive of Denmark\u0027s government.I understand why they closed the border, and I also understand why they did it so quick, he said. They made the right decision, just look at the figures today. If you compare to Great Britain today, which did not lock down the borders, they have a point.”But once you open up for married couples you should also open up for life partners, everything else is a total lottery and unfair”.Caroline Ørsum, a children\u0027s writer based in Copenhagen, has been in a long-term relationship with Soumu, who comes from Kolkata but lives in Finland, for a year.Soumu has been flying to Denmark about every three weeks. We\u0027ve also spent Christmas and New Year together, and we\u0027ve also been able to go on small workations together, since we\u0027re both self-employed.After the border opened to romantic partners she hopes to be reunited with Soumu next month. Hopefully, he\u0027s going to come here in two weeks,” she said. It\u0027s been really stressful --  especially the part about not knowing anything, not having any idea and so your imagination is free to run wild.They each celebrated their birthdays during the period when they were separated.We made the same cake in two countries, so we\u0027ve been watching ourselves on Skype eating the same cake.  . . but it\u0027s not quite the same on Skype as in real life.Ms Ørsum was so frustrated by the border closure that on May 8, she started a Facebook group for lovers separated by coronavirus border closures.Of the 291 members of Ms Ørsum\u0027s group, 25 have a lover in the UK, 17 in the US, 15 in Germany, and 8 in the Netherlands. Another couple left ided by the border closure - and who will not benefit from its partial reopening - are Canadian Melinda Schneider and her Danish boyfriend Adrian Carlsen.They met in February 2018, when he travelled to her hometown, Bradford in Ontario, to play for the local Bradford Bulls ice hockey team.Until the lockdown the two had been seeing each other every two to three months, with Melinda travelling to Denmark, where Adrian is now playing for the Hvidovre Fighters.To be separated due to these closed borders has been increasingly difficult, especially not knowing that there is any hope of us being united again in the near future,” she said.The reopening of the border only includes those resident in Germany and the Nordic countries.We genuinely don’t understand what my nationality has to do with my likelihood of infection, said Ms Schneider. Since Ontario is the last province in Canada to do any opening, I have been home and isolating since I was laid off from my jobs and university converted to online instruction on March 15th.Bente Strand, 77, from Nykøbing on the Danish island of Falster, met her American sweetheart Matthew Gruskin, 78, while backpacking in Greece back in 1965.The couple hitchhiked around the Middle East, before travelling on a Vespa from Athens to Amsterdam. She then lived with him for a year in New York while he finished his law degree. When she returned to Denmark, however, they drifted apart.After Ms Gruskin\u0027s second wife died seven years ago, he got back in touch and the couple have been conducting a passionate late-life romance ever since.But as Mr Gruskin is American, the border relaxation does not apply to the couple.Those of us with sweethearts of other nationalities find it very unfair, Ms Strand complained. Why not our sweethearts? We are very happy that others are able to see their lovers again, but we can\u0027t, and we don\u0027t know when we can be together again.The two have spent more than half of their time together over the past seven years. They had been planning on meeting in Ireland in May, and then flying to Denmark in June before going to see the Faroe Islands.We are not young any longer,” said Ms Strand. “Which is why we don\u0027t want to waste any time. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus positive good news round up tennis aces return","story":"Good news for tennis enthusiasts who are missing their fix of summer court action this Thursday, with news guaranteed to make you stock up on strawberries and cream.Andy Murray is to make his first competitive tennis appearance in more than six months as part of a new event next month which is being organised by his brother Jamie.The exhibition event will be without the usual masses gathered on Murray Mount, but will give the Scotsman a chance to continue his impressive recovery from injury and play competitively for the first time in six months.It also bodes well for further planned tennis fixtures in the United Kingdom in July.Meanwhile, Andrea Bocelli has revealed that he had coronavirus in March and has made a full recovery.The Italian opera singer has been prominent during the pandemic, taking part in the global stay-at-home concert and performing on Easter Sunday at the empty Milan Cathedral, in what fast became the biggest live-streamed classical music event ever, having been viewed by over 40 million people.Bocelli and his wife - who has also recovered - are now donating their plasma to a hospital in Pisa, where it will be used as research in the search for a Covid-19 cure.And the Devon County Show has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest line of knitted bunting, with 79,001 flags knitted by thousands of contributors globally.A continuous line of the bunting was laid out across the floor space of Exeter\u0027s Westpoint Arena, where it will remain until September.Here’s the rest of today’s good news:Switzerland announced on Wednesday that it will lift limits on larger public gatherings next month, and ease up travel within the Schengen travel area by mid-July.

In an article for the New Statesman, he wrote: As a columnist this would all be fine. But BBC presenters, even when there is a popular view about an issue, are not supposed to turn into columnists.The BBC\u0027s statement on 27 May – with the punchline: \u0027the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality\u0027 – was right, clear and prompt. The programme\u0027s introduction was criticised by Chris Green, Conservative MP for Bolton West, who said on Twitter that it had a clear bias and had nothing to do with the BBC\u0027s mission to inform and educate.He added: We do not need Newsnight to behave as poor quality entertainment.But the vast majority of those who watched Newsnight or a clip of the introduction were in Maitlis\u0027 corner.The 49-year-old broadcaster tweeted: Been overwhelmed by all the kindness, messages - and support on here - and I\u0027ve probably missed much of it.A big thank you from us all at Newsnight.Her absence the night after the monologue sparked suggestions that she had been replaced on the flagship BBC Two show, but Maitlis said she had asked for the evening off.She tweeted: So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague Katie Razzall for stepping in...She did so because I asked for the night off - knowing tonight\u0027s programme would be in the most excellent hands.Razzall also tweeted: Just for the record, Emily Maitlis has not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off - and if I thought she had been, I certainly wouldn\u0027t have agreed to present the show.In her introduction to Tuesday\u0027s show, Maitlis said Mr Cummings had broken the rules and the country can see that, and it\u0027s shocked the Government cannot.She said: The longer ministers and the Prime Minister tell us he worked within (the rules), the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be.The public mood is one of fury, contempt and anguish, she said.Following controversy over the monologue, the BBC issued a swift response.It said staff had been reminded of the guidelines around impartiality, adding that the corporation must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output.The programme should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme.As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality, the BBC said.Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan branded the BBC statement utterly disgraceful, saying the corporation was chucking one of its best journalists under the bus for telling the truth.His words were echoed by journalist and former Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, who said the decision made him sick.National Union of Journalists general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: At a time of national crisis, frank and fearless journalism that scrutinises and holds this Government to account is more necessary than ever.She said it was clear as day that Mr Cummings breached lockdown rules, adding: Journalists should be congratulated for holding policymakers to account for actions that risk a monumental breach of trust during a public health crisis.Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the broadcaster had responded rapidly to the incident.He tweeted: For the BBC to come out, in such terms, so quickly is really something, no circling of the wagons - issuing what is effectively a written warning.The Newsnight coverage centred on a trip by Mr Cummings from London to Durham during the lockdown. The Downing Street aide insists he acted reasonably and legally.Last year, the BBC became embroiled in an impartiality row over on-air comments made by BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty about US President Donald Trump and racism.Munchetty was previously judged to have breached BBC editorial guidelines when she discussed remarks made by Mr Trump after he told female Democrats to go back to their own countries.The ruling was later reviewed and reversed by the corporation\u0027s director-general, Lord Hall.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"orwellian atrocity telegraph readers newsnight emily maitlis","story":"BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis failed to appear on the programme on Wednesday evening after the BBC said her monologue about Dominic Cummings breached impartiality guidelines. Ms Maitlis caused a political storm opening the BBC Two programme with the words: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot. The BBC admitted that Maitlis\u0027s monologue did not meet our standards of due impartiality.Read on to see what your fellow  readers have to say and then share your own opinions in the comments section below.Newsnight is a totally pointless biased diatribe of left-wing liberal wokery, as is the presenter. The sooner the programme and presenter are dropped, the better.I can’t wait to see the BBC privatised and the licence fee eliminated.No sane person still believes the BBC is impartial as I am sure we will shortly find when the Brexit extension or another referendum campaign starts shortly.The Conservatives largely have themselves to blame for continuing to allow left-wing figures to dominate senior positions in public sector organisations.It\u0027s so sad, that we see this level of unprofessional polemic described as \u0027savage journalism\u0027 by one Maitlis admirer. I\u0027m a BBC supporter but they are going to be \u0027cut loose\u0027 soon and it\u0027ll be their own darned fault.During the 2016 referendum campaign the BBC was scrupulously fair. Once the result came in, however, all bets were off. Dimbleby’s ashen face appeared to be a signal to anyone at the BBC to begin working against the result.Maitlis’s intemperate and incautious monologue was emblematic of that tendency.More evidence, as if we needed it, that this row is nothing to do with lockdown rules, but everything to do with Brexit.And the BBC is lapping it up. Shame on them.Over a year ago, when the BBC\u0027s anti-Brexit prejudice became too much, we cancelled our licence fee and registered as listed non-payers.Signing up to this register and cutting the coax in the wall meant we could only watch non-live broadcast content, including Amazon Prime movies or Now TV.  Reading of this latest Orwellian atrocity makes it all seem worthwhile.I have remnants of nostalgia for the once world-renowned BBC. The days of Frost, Day, Walden. The superb drama and documentaries. The informative and thought-provoking news items.But, sadly, those days are gone.Ms Maitlis is fully entitled to her views, and in this country, thank goodness, the ability to express them freely. There are multiple organs of communication where she can do so freely and openly.However the BBC as a publicly funded broadcaster is not one of those communication vehicles. Ms Maitlis is unquestionably a good journalist with a commendable track record in investigative reporting. The BBC management and editorial team are well aware of this. The anger directed at her is understandable (especially the hypocrisy of her position on this and Cummings), but it is the editorial team that should shoulder the blame. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korea brings back social distancing measures coronavirus","story":"South Korea on Thursday was forced to beef up its social distancing measures again after the highest spike in coronavirus case in almost two months and warnings from health officials that the surge risked erasing some of the country\u0027s hard-won gains against the pandemic. The announcement came as the Korea Centres for Disease Control (KCDC) reported 79 new cases of Covid-19, with 69 of them linked to a distribution facility owned by Coupang, the country’s leading e-commerce giant, located in Bucheon, west of the capital, Seoul. The tally is feared to increase as thousands of workers and their contacts are tested for the virus, and health officials have cautioned that the country’s much-lauded contact-tracing scheme is being increasingly stretched by new clusters. Following an emergency government meeting, public facilities in Seoul such as parks, museums and art galleries will be closed for the next two weeks. Companies have been urged to adopt more flexible working practices and the staged reopening of schools is now under threat. If we fail to eradicate the spread of the virus in the metropolitan area at an early stage, it will lead to more community infections, eventually undermining school reopenings, Park Neung-hoo, the health minister, said in a press briefing reported by Yonhap. South Korea has never adopted the draconian lockdowns seen in China, but it did enforce a strict social distancing campaign that was enforced between March 22 and May 5. On May 6, it introduced a scheme called everyday life quarantine which gave public facilities and business establishments the leeway to reopen on condition of following basic sanitation measures.However, the country faced a serious setback earlier this month after a cluster that emerged in the capital’s Itaewon nightclub district triggered a new round of infections. To date, 261 new cases have been linked to Itaewon clubs and bars. Entertainment venues in Seoul have been strongly advised to close down over the next two weeks. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the KCDC director, said the country may need to step up its restrictions again as it had become increasingly difficult for health workers to track transmissions amid increasing public activity.“We will do our best to trace contacts and implement preventive measures, but there’s a limit to such efforts,” she said. “There’s a need to maximise social distancing in areas where the virus is circulating, to force people to avoid public facilities and other crowded spaces.”The new clusters of infections have made schools jittery and hundreds have chosen not to reopen.  All 251 schools in Bucheon have been closed and the authorities in Incheon, another city bordering the capital, have also suspended the reopening of 243 schools. Nationwide, 838, or 4 per cent of the total 20,902 schools, have not yet welcomed students back. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel restrictions air bridges could place end june","story":"The Prime Minister has given fresh hope that British holidaymakers could travel overseas this summerWhen can we go on holiday again? Can I take a UK holiday yet?  Will holidays be cheaper after coronavirus? For when should I reschedule my holiday?Boris Johnson has revived hopes that an overseas summer holiday could still be on the cards in 2020, after suggesting that the UK could have \u0027air bridge\u0027 agreements in place by June 29.Air bridges would allow British holidaymakers to travel to certain countries without the need to quarantine on arrival, or when they return home.Speaking last night at the Commons Liaison Committee, the Prime Minister said he wanted to keep flows as generous as we can.The Conservative chair of the transport select committee, Huw Merriman, asked:  Many people have commented that a sensible regime would look at the countries and their R rate and if it\u0027s below ours, then there should be no need for quarantine.Whilst that may not be possible for June 8, will that be possible for the next three week period which is June 29, to allow those buying cheaper flights for their summer holidays, which have gone on sale today, to be removed from the threat of quarantine?To this Mr Johnson replied: Yes, absolutely – we want to make sure we use the three-week reviews to be sensible – we want to drive the R down as fast as we can in this country and to have as sensible a quarantine scheme as possible and to keep flows as generous as we can.The Prime Minister added that the UK will have to make progress in tackling the disease, and to have evidence that other countries are in as good a position as the UK, before any air bridges could be agreed.As it stands, British holidaymakers must go into a compulsory 14-day quarantine when returning to the UK, as of June 8. Failure to observe the rules could result in a £1,000 fixed-penalty notice in England.

That is, until coronavirus hit, and many were forced to cancel their travel plans due to the global shutdown.But as countries around the world show signs of loosening restrictions, many fans of the platform will be wondering when it will be possible to book again.Non-essential bookings are banned until May 31, but it\u0026#39s likely to continue until July 4Unless the government issues an exception for private rentals within the UK, Airbnb will likely keep non-essential UK bookings banned until July 4. Outside the UK, however, things are much less restricted.Emma Cooke explains it all.We have seen further cancellations from cruise lines today, with one – Victory Cruise Lines, operated by American Queen Steamboat Co – scrapping its entire 2020 season, Benjamin Parker reports. The line has blamed government restrictions and uncertainties of future travel through Canadian waters. Their announcement comes as Celestyal, Marella, Costa and AIDA cruise lines push back their restart until August at the earliest.You can see the full list of expected restart dates here.Our writer, Annabel Fenwick Elliott laments how picnics have been put front and centre of British social life for the summer of 2020:Laughter, sunshine, adorable sandwiches - what’s not to like about a picnic? Plenty, I’d argue. Even now, when pubs and restaurants are off the cards and parks are still just about the only place we can enjoy freedom. It may be an unpopular opinion but ask yourself honestly: do you really enjoy picnics, or does (socially distanced) peer pressure propel you to partake?There are at least 18 reasons why picnics are in fact terrible, she argues. See what they are, here.One of the world\u0027s most expensive holiday destinations is set to become even more costly as the Males plans to introduce compulsory COVID-19 testing for all arrivals, among a raft of new health and safety measures. In an attempt to woo back visitors, Minister of Tourism Ali Wahed has announced that the Males will set itself apart as a \u0027safe tourism\u0027 destination and a \u0027COVID-free country\u0027. So far, the Males has recorded five deaths and 1,457 cases, the majority in the densely-packed capital of Malé. It was also suggested that well-heeled travellers arriving by yacht or private jet will be allowed to reenter the Males from June 1, with commercial flights restarting from July 1. Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways are all expected to be among the first airlines to return, bringing tourists from India, Sri Lanka, China, Korea and the Middle East. Tourists coming from Europe and the rest of the world would likely follow towards the end of the year.Read the full story, here.Latin America has become known as the the epicentre of Covid-19 – what hopes are there for a trip in 2020?Brazil has reported more than 40,000 cases and 24,000 deaths from Covid-19Colin Stewart, chairman of the Latin American Travel Association, says:“Latin America has some strong points of differentiation which should help kick-start the region’s travel industry once restrictions are lifted.“These include the fact it attracts a more adventurous traveller that is less risk averse, wide-open natural spaces with strong tourism potential away from crowded centres, strong sustainability and community-led initiatives, and long lead times in terms of bookings.“While this is a challenging time for all our members and all the people that rely on tourism across the continent, the Latin American travel industry has always proved to be a resilient one and we have every confidence that beyond summer 2020 we will begin to see a revitalisation in the industry.”​Read the full article, here.For gondoliers, hoteliers, tour guides and restaurateurs in Venice, June 3 (the date when Italy reopens its borders) cannot come soon enough, but not all residents will be welcoming tourists back with open arms.“Venice is a five-star restaurant sold as a fast-food restaurant. We shouldn’t waste the chance to start again from scratch,” said Matteo Secchi from Venessia, a pressure group that campaigns to protect the city’s identity and stem the flow of residents from the centre.Usually packed with tourists, the Rialto Bridge has been empty during lockdownIn 2008 the group installed a digital counter in a shop window near the Rialto Bridge so that Venetians could witness their exodus. At the counter\u0027s launch residents in the historical centre numbered 60,720. Now it is less than 53,000. Secchi added:“We inherited an engineering miracle on a par with the Pyramids at Giza or China’s Great Wall,” says Secchi. Tourism is a precious resource that we have wasted. My hope is that the typical Venetian businesses – the artisans, ateliers and traditional boat builders that have survived the overtourism of the past years – will finally have their day and that visitors might find an authentic Venice – not an anonymous bland bazaar.”Read the full article here.EasyJet will axe up to 4,500 jobs and slash capacity in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, writes Simon Foy.The airline will cut staff numbers by up to 30pc as it reduces the size of its fleet to cope with lower passenger demand. EasyJet employs about 15,000 staff, according to its 2019 annual report. It will launch an employee consultation about the cuts in the coming days. The low-cost carrier announced last week it will return its planes to the skies from June 15, but will only operate a small number of flights.​Read the full article here.Comment: Nigeria moves closer to becoming a failed statePolitics latest news: Boris Johnson to set out next phase of lockdown with more outdoor freedoms expectedExclusive: Dominic Cummings row re-erupts as police deliver verdict on lockdown \u0026#39breach\u0026#39 Households told not to water lawns as Britain bakes under \u0026#39exceptionally\u0026#39 dry MayComment: Let\u0026#39s offer Hong Kong\u0026#39s repressed masses freedom from communist tyrannyThe NHS Test and Trace system, explainedWhich shops are opening in June?Dinosaur breed usually found in China and Brazil discovered in UK for first timeWhen will the UK lockdown next be reviewed?Comment: It is absurd to blame Dominic Cummings for the fact that lockdown is frayingDozens of beavers legally shot in Scotland since they were given protected statusSchools need to be open longer to allow \u0026#39Covid generation\u0026#39 to catch up after lockdownMissing Indian man finds family with help of TikTokFont hailed as groundbreaking for learning has no memory boosting effects, study findsScots can host barbecues for eight people - but guests must bring food and cannot use inside toiletFrance learns of secret sex, film and rock romance between Catherine Deneuve and Johnny HallydayRobber who waged \u0026#39campaign of burglary\u0026#39 against wealthy homeowners jailed after £100k raidExclusive: 100-year-old luxury travel company Kuoni offers UK holidays for the first timeTest and trace system could lead to wave of employment tribunals, lawyers warnBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/05/01/12/shutterstock-126910358.jpg","title":"cash machines coronavirus spread card payments contactless","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.ATM transactions plunge 40 per cent as people shop online and ditch cash payments in-store\u0026nbspWorries that paying with cash could help to spread coronavirus have caused British shoppers to turn to card payments in ever larger numbers.PayPoint said that card payment transactions were up by more than three quarters in the first 17 days of April, while transactions at cash machines dropped 40 per cent compared with a year earlier.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the 12 months leading up to 31 March, which only covers a small part of the crisis, card payments rose 21 cent, with ATM transactions down 4.1 per cent.“It is likely consumers\u0027 cash usage habits will fundamentally change, however the need for cash access, as a contingency and for vulnerable consumers, will continue to be important,” PayPoint said in a statement to shareholders on Thursday.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?It came as the company reported a 3.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profit to £56.8m, up to £213.3m.“We delivered growth in net revenues and profit before tax for the year.

The Financial Times reported that the Treasury’s plans will include barring companies from putting any more employees on furlough.This measure is aimed at preventing firms from putting workers on furlough who would otherwise have been kept on full time, only to bring them back part time with the state picking up some of the wage bill.Ministers will be hoping that, as the economy gradually reopens, companies can survive without government support.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowances are more generous for couples and families, but remain lower than in many other European countries.Businesses could find their recovery hampered by high levels of debt built up to get them through the worst of the crisis.Banks have approved “bounce back” loans totalling £18.5bn for 465,000 smaller businesses.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.It is not safe to start reopening all schools next week, a group of independent scientists has warned. The committee accused the government of not listening to its own scientific advice as it pushes for certain classes to go back to school on 1 June.In a new report, the Independent Sage group said the proposals risk “a new surge of cases of Covid-19 in some communities”. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe government’s scientific advisory committee, Sage, has modelled the impact of seven different ways schools could reopen, which all result in the ‘R’ rate – or the rate of transmission – increasing, the group said. “The school reopening scenario chosen by the government is not one of those modelled by Sage making the potential impact of reopening even more uncertain,” the Independent Sage report said. “Robust testing systems are not in place everywhere.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The committee of independent scientists added: “Additionally, public adherence to social distancing is influenced by trust in the government and its messaging. This trust is increasingly strained.“We therefore believe that by going ahead with a general school reopening from 1 June, the government is not following the advice of its Sage group.” Dr Zubaida Haque​, an Independent Sage committee member, said it was “not clear” why the government settled on its proposal – which is to bring Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes back on 1 June, as well as to introduce “face-to-face” support for Years 10 and 12 from next week. The plan “isn’t a model that has been modelled for”, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust said at a press conference, adding: “That is a huge concern.” Schools have been told to plan for a partial return to school from next Monday, although some local authorities – including in Durham and Lancashire – have advised against welcoming more students back on this date.

Sir David King, a former government chief scientific adviser, set up Independent Sage to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown after the official Sage faced criticism over an alleged lack of transparency. He claimed the new board was necessary because he feared experts were deferring to ministers.Speaking about the plans to reopen schools on 1 June, Sir David said: “Whilst we totally understand the imperative to get the nation’s children back in the classroom as soon as it is safe to do so, the evidence clearly shows that the government has jumped the gun here.”He added: “Crucially we conclude that the best way forward cannot be one size fits all, it requires localised case by case responses to ensure that the risk of flair ups is kept to a minimum.”​Boris Johnson’s plans to ease the lockdown will be confirmed on Thursday in an official review that Downing Street expects will give the all-clear for schools to welcome back more students on 1 June – although this plan could change depending on further scientific advice. ‘Make decisions early’: French headteacher on reopening of schoolsThe UK prime minister has said it is his “intention” for schools to begin resuming with Reception, Years 1 and Year 6 classes from Monday. Some students have started going back to school in other countries that have been badly-hit by coronavirus, including France. “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing, a Department for Education spokesperson told The Independent. “Plans for a cautious, phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.The spokesperson added: “We have engaged closely with a range of relevant organisations, including the unions, throughout the past ten weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the government’s scientific advisers, and will continue to do so. We have also published detailed guidance on the protective measures schools should take to reduce the risk of transmission.”Additional reporting by Press AssociationDepartment for Education\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Building features to combat that would require the company to sacrifice engagement – and by extension, profit – according to a later document from 2018 which described the proposals as “antigrowth” and requiring “a moral stance.”“Our algorithms exploit the human brain’s attraction to isiveness,” a 2018 presentation warned, warning that if action was not taken Facebook would provide users “more and more isive content in an effort to gain user attention \u0026amp increase time on the platform.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAccording to a report from the Wall Street Journal, in 2017 and 2018 Facebook conducted research through newly created “Integrity Teams” to tackle extremist content and a cross-jurisdictional task force dubbed “Common Ground.”The Common Ground team was intended to tackle polarisation directly, said people familiar with the team, although its intentions were “explicitly not going to build products that attempt to change people’s beliefs,” but to create products that increase empathy, understanding, and humanization of the ‘other side’” according to a 2018 document.Trump to sign executive order pursuing social media giantsThe project was particularly concerned about private groups following a 2016 presentation by a Facebook researcher that found extremist content in more than one-third of large German political groups, most of which were private and so their content was not visible to outside members, on the social media site.These groups were disproportionately influenced by a small coterie of hyperactive users, with the presentation stating that the majority of people joining extremist groups were encouraged by Facebook’s algorithm. “Our recommendation systems grow the problem,” the presentation said.While Facebook was dedicated to neutrality, deciding that the social media site should not police users’ opinions or vilify users’ political opponents, according to internal documents, it was suggested that Facebook change its algorithm to suggest a wider range of Facebook groups or adding a feature to create smaller communities within Facebook Groups where political arguments could be held.However, Facebook executives including chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg “largely shelved the basic research, according to previously unreported internal documents and people familiar with the effort, and weakened or blocked efforts to apply its conclusions to Facebook products.”Facebook\u0027s vice president of global public policy Joel Kaplan argued that such actions were “paternalistic” at a time when disapproval from Kaplan’s team would dissolve a project, said people familiar with its development.Negative reviews from the policy team reportedly stopped a classification system for hyperpolarising content. Efforts to suppress clickbait about politics were also shut down.Russia interfered in 2016 to back Trump, new Senate report confirmsCarlos Uribe, who led the newsfeed Integrity Team at the time, attempted to push “Sparing Sharing,” which would have reduced the reach of content from hyperactive users – who were usually far more partisan than average users and engaged in behaviour similar to spammers. Uribe did not comment to the Wall Street Journal, but did confirm that he supported the Sparing Sharing proposal. Facebook researchers suggested that it could bolster the platform\u0027s defence against spam and manipulation like that which had allowed interference from Russia during the 2016 presidential election.However, Kaplan and other Facebook executives pushed back on Uribe’s proposal, saying that mitigating the ability of Facebook’s most dedicated users to push content would unfairly affect them – hypothesising about a Girl Scout troop who became super-sharers by promoting cookies as an example.Zuckerberg says Twitter shouldn\u0027t be \u0027arbiter of truth\u0027Facebook announces oversight board to decide free speech controversiesMark Zuckerberg says Facebook ‘slow to understand’ Russian operationsFacebook gives insight into how future workspaces could lookWhat has Facebook done to fix election interference since 2016?While Zuckerberg approved a weakened version of the program, he reportedly said that he was losing interest in the effort to change the platform for the good of its users and asked not to have that subject brought to him again. Smaller changes were made to the platform, including efforts to promote news stories from a large user base and penalties for publishers who shared fake news.Uribe since left the company because of frustration with executives, and said that while proposals in the US would affect conservatives it would affect opposite groups in other countries. The Common Ground team was disbanded, and while the Integrity Teams still exist many senior staffers either left Facebook entirely or moved to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.In response to the report, Facebook has said in a blog post that the Wall Street Journal wilfully ignored critical facts that undermined its narrative which, the company says, includes changes to the News Feed, limiting the reach of Pages and Groups that breach Facebook\u0027s standards or share fake news, combating hate speech and misinformation, and building a robust Integrity Team.This news comes while Donald Trump is preparing to sign an executive order to target social media sites after Twitter added a fact-checking label to his tweets claming that postal voting would result in a fraudulent election. The president claimed that social media sites are biased against right-wing voices, a topic which is hotly debated.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The figures will pile further pressure on Rishi Sunak as he seeks to reduce state support without causing millions of job losses.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The chancellor is reportedly preparing to announce this week that the government will close the scheme to new applicants as it seeks to wind down its economic programmes over the coming months.Mr Sunak said earlier this month that he would extend the furlough scheme for three months to the end of October, with employers required to contribute to wages and employees expected to come back to work part-time from the start of August.The chancellor is due to clarify details of that contribution by Friday. The Financial Times reported that the Treasury’s plans will include barring companies from putting any more employees on furlough.This measure is aimed at preventing firms from putting workers on furlough who would otherwise have been kept on full time, only to bring them back part time with the state picking up some of the wage bill.Ministers will be hoping that, as the economy gradually reopens, companies can survive without government support.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Allowances are more generous for couples and families, but remain lower than in many other European countries.Businesses could find their recovery hampered by high levels of debt built up to get them through the worst of the crisis.Banks have approved “bounce back” loans totalling £18.5bn for 465,000 smaller businesses. The loans of up to £50,000 are 100 per cent guaranteed by the state and require minimal checks before approval.A further £8.2bn has been lent under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) to 43,045 companies.CBILS loans are backed to 80 per cent by the government and require banks to carry out checks on the borrowers. A similar scheme for larger businesses has lent £820m to 154 companies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The A Star is Born actor shared images of herself in a Chromatica branded vehicle under the caption: “Delivering Chromatica myself to every retailer around the world. In Chromatica time and distance do not exist.” Fans have speculated the move is an attempt to prevent a person working for a delivery company from leaking the album online.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLast month, Chromatica’s tracklist appeared on Target’s website. Though it was quickly taken down, it was quickly discovered and spread across the internet. The singer posted the entire tracklist the same day that the information leaked — presumably because there was no chance of keeping it under wraps any more — confirming that Ariana Grande, Blackpink, and Elton John will all make appearances.Tim Burgess on the brilliant Dexys Midnight Runners album, Too-Rye-AyHow Desperate Housewives blazed a trail for Little Fires EverywhereMatthew Perry gave Lisa Kudrow the cookie time jar from FriendsOthers think the decision to hand-deliver copies of Chromatica is just a joke about bending the laws of time and space. Delivery company FedEx have been roped into the publicity stunt after a fan posted a fake complaint against Gaga’s delivery service on Twitter.“@FedExHelp this woman almost hit me while driving down my block delivering packages for you,” wrote the fan. “I wrote her plates down just in time.. it read “PSSYWGN” please do something immediately.”A spokesperson for FedEx replied: “Hello, this is Lisa.  I’m sorry to hear of this incident.  Please DM as much information as possible. Name, address, phone number, email address, truck number, and if it was a FedEx Express, Ground, or Home Delivery truck so that I can report this to the appropriate station.”Chromatica will be released this Friday (29 May).The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is almost a third more than fathers, who are doing an average of 50 hours a week.It comes after a study by the London School of Economics recently found coronavirus is exacerbating the gender gap as women bear the brunt of childcare responsibilities and homeschooling during lockdown — whether they’re working or not.I founded the Wages for Housework campaign – little has changed sinceThe report found women are more likely to deal with homeschooling, childcare and chores around the house even if they are juggling this with working at the same time.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together with the way we are adapting our working lives to cope during the lockdown, this gives me hope that in the long term, a more equal society will emerge.”The report found women are more likely than men to lose their jobs in the forthcoming recession because a larger number work in sectors — such as hospitality, leisure, tourism and the arts — that are forecast to be hardest hit.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

BBC chucking one of its best journalists @maitlis under the bus for TELLING THE TRUTH? Utter disgraceful.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMs Maitlis had received praise from some viewers for her opening to the show, in which she said that Boris Johnson’s top advisor Dominic Cummings had broken the rules of lockdown and added: “The country can see that, and it’s shocked the government cannot.”She said in a 90-second monologue: “The disease is not a great leveller, the consequences of which everyone – rich or poor – suffers the same.

Hundreds of thousands have added their names days after it emerged Dominic Cummings had travelled from London to Durham in April to be close to potential childcare and then to nearby town Barnard Castle.The number of people who had signed the petition on Change.org – called ‘”Dominic Cummings must be sacked” – stood at around 908,726 on Thursday morning. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe prime minister has backed his top aide during the controversy, saying on Wednesday it was time to “move on” from allegations the senior advisor broke rules of the lockdown over coronavirus.

Meanwhile, 59 per cent of those polled thought Mr Cummings should quit his post. Scores of Conservative MPs have called for the PM’s chief advisor to be sacked or to resign. In a press conference on Monday, the government aide defended travelling from London to Durham with his family in April, saying he believed he behaved “reasonably”.He said they drove north to be near family who had offered childcare in case him and his wife became too ill to look after their four-year-old son.

She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.“We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely, we drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town. We did not visit the castle, we did not walk around the town.”Mr Cummings said he had felt a “bit sick” so they had walked about 10 to 15 metres to the riverbank where they sat for about 15 minutes until he felt better.Claimed he had previously warned of coronavirus pandemicMr Cummings used the briefing to insist he, contrary to some reports, had not resisted the introduction of lockdown measures and had in fact previously warned of the dangers of a coronavirus pandemic.“For years, I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning,” he said.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

silence at Guy\u0027s HospitalMr Cummings did in fact write an entry on his blog in March 2019, which more specifically examined the possibility of a deadly outbreak being triggered by a coronavirus accidentally released from a laboratory during scientific experiments. However, there have been suggestions that the reference to coronavirus was actually added to the blog in April 2020.Scientists currently believe Sars-CoV-2, the virus which causes Covid-19, jumped from animals to humans as the product of natural evolution.Described his family’s farm as ‘sort of concrete blocks’The PM’s senior adviser insisted that his trip to Durham to isolate was not because the property on his family’s farm was a “nice place to be”.“The point about it was not that it was some nice place to be. If you have been there, you would see that it\u0027s sort of concrete blocks,” he said.“The point about it was not that it was a nice place to be, but that it was the safest place to be in the circumstances – and it meant that I didn\u0027t have to expose other people to risk unless I absolutely had to in a critical emergency.”Didn’t make inquiries about childcare in London before making tripMr Cummings used the briefing to insist the journey had been necessary because he and his wife had no reasonable childcare options in London if they both fell ill with coronavirus.“I suddenly got a call from my wife who was at home looking after our four-year-old child,” he explained in a prepared statement.“She told me she suddenly felt badly ill, she vomited and felt like she might pass out, and there would be nobody to look after our child. None of our usual childcare options were available.”However, in subsequent questioning from journalists, Mr Cummings later admitted he did not make inquiries about potential childcare in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

One son, aged around 15, was allegedly discovered living in the basement after Mr Gray admitted this to authorities. “The house was filled with urine smell, faeces throughout the house, partially flooded basement,” said the Roane County court on Monday. Investigators searched the address over the weekend after someone told police that the youngest child was walking alone near the family home. Whilst his parents were unaware, Roane County authorities located the child who allegedly told them about the basement and the other child buried in the backyard, reported WVLT News. Detectives then arrived at the house to investigate.The couple also admitted that the children had not received medical or dental attention for at least six years prior to the investigation. At the same time, authorities said the children had “stunted growth” and that the parents had withheld food from them as punishment. The couple could face further charges.

If we do nothing, it’s the worst that will happen when it’s simply a matter of common sense to avoid all of this,” he added.Countries across the globe have been ordering millions of pieces of PPE during the Covid-19 pandemic in a bid to help stop the spread of the novel disease.While PPE such as face masks is vital in helping to prevent transmission between medics in hospital, there is little evidence to suggest that they work in the wider community.Environmentalists have pointed out that the use of disposable masks by the wider public is likely to add to the glut of plastic pollution threatening the health of oceans and marine life.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David

But when will they reopen  heres everything you need to know.Dentists are closed to all but emergency treatment after Prime Minister Boris Johnson placed the UK into lockdown on Monday, March , in a bid to tackle coronavirus.The lockdown is currently being reviewed at three-week intervals, but it is unclear when the current restrictions will be lted with the Governments medical advisers advising that a number of tests be met before measures are relaxed.Consistent with Government advice to limit social contact, dentists across the country have closed to prevent the spread of the bug, except for emergency appointments.Treatments including routine fillings, root canals and scaling and polishing will be completely stopped unless the patient has a serious medical emergency of dental cause.However, dentists have been told they should start arranging appointments, as they could reopen in the next few weeks, according to MPs, with June  the date they could be targeting.Sir Desmond Swanye is among those calling for them to reopen, saying he didnt understand why dentists cant open straight away.Conservatives New Forest West MP said: We are talking about highly trained, skilled physicians who know how to protect themselves and who are accustomed to wearing PPE anyway.During the lockdown, some dentists have been taking virtual consultations.Emergency treatment is available with some patients being treated in their cars by gowned dentists.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.A number of rules are set to be put in place to ensure social distancing, according to the General Dental Council.In reception and waiting areas, markers will be placed two metres apart while perspex shields are being considered as physical barriers.Staff are expected to be screened daily and face regular risk assessments.Patients time at reception desks will also be minimised, meaning digital appointment booking systems to be in place and limit on receipts.In the treatment rooms, appointment times are to be amended so that there is enough time in between to ensure decontamination protocols are being followed.Meanwhile, sanitising stations to be put in place for patients to use upon entry, while dentists will be required to have sufficient PPE stock in advance with many already wearing during treatment.The British Orthodontic Society has advised that no orthodontic patient should attend any clinic at this time.In an extreme emergency, the patient should contact the practice or unit by phone and discuss ways of resolving their problem at home.Telephone advice remains available during normal hours at the majority of dental surgeries.Certain emergency procedures will still be undertaken but only for those without symptoms of Covid- – which are usually a high temperature and a new, continuous cough.Delivery of urgent care to anyone with symptoms of coronavirus will take place at designated urgent dental care centres.Dentists who spoke anonymously to the BBC on March  said there have been widespread concerns within the profession due to their work in close proximity to the mouths of patients.The BDA has also said Covid- represents a major risk to the financial viability of dental practices due to closures.Chief Executive Martin Woodrow revealed that the BDA had been in touch with the team at NHS England to urge the importance of agreeing financial support for practices.The PM on Monday, March , said people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, exercise, medical need and travelling to and from work for key workers.Mr Johnson threatened the nation with finesthey did not obey the new rules.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.Taking London as an example, with a current R value of . for coronavirus, it means that for every ten people who have the virus, it will be passed on to only four more people.The low R value means thateveryone continues lockdown and social distancing measures, London would theoretically be virus free by the end of May.The World Health Organisationestimated at the start of March that the coronavirus R stood somewhere between  and ..The UK is now generally below that because of the lockdown and the social distancing measures we have been doing over the past two months.In comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to be roughly . while measles has a reproductive value of between  and .Despite this, these figures are not set in stone because a given pathogens R value changes with place and time.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, told The : R is an indication of how much an infectious virus will spread in a population, and ious things impact that value.The susceptibility, size and density of the population that the infection is introduced into matters, as well as the infectiousness of the virus itself.Predictions of the R for Covid- are currently ied because no one knows exactly how many people have been infected in total.According to modelling published by Imperial College London, the R value stood somewhere between  and . in Europe before lockdowns came into effect.The most recent estimate of the nation-wide R-rate is said to be between . and .Below R is the important bit because it means the virus will likely peter out, but things are generally worse in the north of England to the point that the trend could reverse.New data released May  from Cambridge University suggests that in the North East and Yorkshire the R rate - the average number of people an infected person can pass the virus on to - is feared to be at around ..The South West has an R rate of ., slightly more than the North West which has a rate of ..Both the East of England and South East have a rate of ., followed by the Midlands with . and finally London with ..On May , , Boris Johnson urged the British public to help reduce the R value.In his address to the nation, he said: It depends on all of us – the entire country – to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down.He added: We must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease - the R - back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid Alert System run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.And that Covid Alert Level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases.He continued: And in turn that Covid Alert Level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures – the lower the level the fewer the measures.The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.During one of the Downing Street press conferences, Sir Patrick Vallance revealed that it was highly likely there is an R value in the community of less than one.This means that every infected inidual passes the disease to less than one other person.This shows the lockdown has had a positive impact on the coronavirus outbreak as to bring an outbreak under control the R value needs to fall below one.However, when the number remains higher than one, the epidemic will grow.Sir Patrick admitted that the R value could be higher in some care homes and hospitals.He said: As I’ve said, it’s not true that the R is necessarily below one in every hospital or in every care home, and that’s the important area that we now need to look at and make sure that the appropriate measures are in place to try and reduce the R there.But it doesn’t change the overall view that I’ve described, that the R overall is below one and therefore we expect to see the slowing and the turn of the epidemic.There are lots of infection control measures experts can use to push this number down and reduce the spread.A study in the Lancet in April, for example, estimated that travel restrictions in Wuhan caused R to drop from . to . after just one week.Sir Patrick said that the draconian social distancing measures introduced in the UK have had a substantial impact so far.This is because as less people come into contact with one another, there is less chance for the virus to spread.He said on Thursday, April : The social distancing measures are needed to reduce the levels right down to a low level.At that point there may be decisions about which ones to relax and which ones not to relax.It’s important to keep the R below one, and this is all about trying to reduce contacts, particularly between households, reduce transmission and keep the levels low across the community.And Sir Patrick added that even small changes in the measures that are in place could lead to the R going above one.According to a pre-print study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the average number of people an inidual comes into contact with each day has dropped by  per cent since the UK’s lockdown began.“This would be sufficient to reduce R from a value from . before the lockdown to . during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective,” the study, which tracked over , adults and has not yet been peer reviewed, concluded.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want Dom’s head on a skewer.In the last  weeks, nothing exemplies The Blob better than its handling of Coronavirus, the non-epidemic which has been allowed to drag this country into destitution.A public inquiry will examine precisely how this country stumbled unprepared into a predictable - and predicted - health emergency.The blame game is already under way.But it is already clear the NHS bureaucracy was caught flat-footed.Along with its blundering sidekick, Public Health England, it failed to provide frontline health staff - and likely Covid victims with the protection they deserved.Under pressure, the NHS panicked and made the decision to clear all beds for incoming coronavirus victims - while disastrously shunting elderly infected patients into care homes.PHE, the vast qango whose mission goal is to protect the nation from pandemics, failed abysmally to provide the testing needed as a first line of defence.Neither of these two bodies thought fit to build the necessary stockpile of Personal Protection Equipment, leaving frontline medical staff exposed to the virus.Meanwhile, along came Bonking Boffin Neil Ferguson who created Lockdown panic with fantasy claims of half a million likely dead - a figure no other scientist has supported.Indeed, highly qualied professionals including a Nobel prize-winning Stanford Professor of Chemistry, Michael Levitt, insist NO lives were saved by lockdown.Sunetra Gupta, Oxford Professor of Theoretical Epidemiology, says the UK death rate from Coronavirus is -in-a-, with Lockdown an unnecessary “luxury”.“I think there’s a chance we might have done better by doing nothing at all,” she says.Prof Gupta echoes a growing view that Britain couldto normal tomorrow, opening pubs, nightclubs and festivals, without putting lives needlessly at risk.“It is very dangerous to talk about lockdown without recognising the enormous costs that it has on other vulnerable sectors in the population.“The truth is that lockdown is a luxury, and it’s a luxury that the middle classes are enjoying and higher income countries are enjoying at the expense of the poor, the vulnerable and less developed countries.“It’s a very serious crisis.”Prof Gupta is describing those Sun readers who will bear the brunt of the looming economic crash.It is fair to say that but for “experts” like Ferguson - who has a long and costly history of disastrous predictions - Lockdown would have been lted sooner and with less economic pain.It is also true that while most people - including me - stuck rigidly to Downing Street rules, countless thousands have broken them by leaving home and visiting relatives.Yes, Cummings and his we - both hit by Coronavirus - broke the letter of the Lockdown law by driving their -year-old son  miles north to self-isolation in Durham.In the same circumstances I would have done the same and so, I suspect, would many readers whatever their political views.Some will rightly insist our leaders should do as they preach.Others will be appalled by the curtain twitching informers who raced to spill the beans.To his credit - and now his cost - Dominic Cummings has never worried about upsetting his critics.He has given his many enemies, some inside the Tory Party, the perfect stick to beat him with.We should be careful before joining in this vendetta against a man who in his own unique way has spoken so effectively for the British people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m not.Eventhe enforcement is far from being perfect, it will still have a tremendous effect.According to the British Pub Association, four out of ten pubs are likely to cease to exist at the end of the crisis.Unlike many restaurants that can stay afloat selling takeaway food, pubs cannot generate income in lockdown.Anyone who says that short-term rationing of alcohol in pubs is not a price worth paying to get them to open up fast must have had one pint too many.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, he hadn’t.“The country can see that and it’s shocked the Government cannot,” she added, before accusing the Prime Minister of “blind loyalty” to Cummings.Then she added, for good measure, that the country had reacted with “fury, contempt and anguish”.I suppose she thought she was speaking for the country with this tendentious, pompous bilge.She was not. She was speaking for herself and those in her North London liberal bubble.The BBC demands that its presenters remain neutral on political matters.Obviously, they don’t. But at least they usually pretend to. Maitlis can’t even manage that. Anyway, the complaints flooded in to Auntie.If this was the first time she’d crossed the line then maybe we might be a little lenient. But it’s not. Far from it.Last September, for example, she managed to force the BBC into that very rarest of things — a public apology, for her appalling behaviour and bias.In an interview she conducted on the programme she was, the BBC concluded, “sneering and bullying”, she was “too persistent and bullying” and “failed to be even-handed”.That was a landmark judgment. I have it framed on the wall of my downstairs khazi. Because the person she had been interviewing was ME.I had turned up to do a debate about Brexit. I was met with a wall of vituperation and abuse that even embarrassed the bloke I was supposed to be debating with, an affable Remainer chap called Tom Baldwin.The BBC warned Newsnight, its hopeless editor and Maitlis that such a breach of neutrality must not happen in the future.It has happened again. So what are they going to do about it  The BBC has admitted Newsnight got it terribly wrong.And will do nothing. Again.Here’s the other thing. I was sacked by the BBC for breaching its code of neutrality. Rightly.I had written an article about how much I hated fox hunting and fox hunters, right at the time the Government was planning to ban the cruel, obnoxious sport.The BBC was right then. But at least I hadn’t broadcast those views on the BBC itself, or allowed them to influence the programme I edited, the Today programme. It was just stuff I wrote in a leftie newspaper.Maitlis broadcasts her idiotic views on her programme!The BBC has to be consistent about this or drop the pretence of neutrality altogether.And for Emily — have some guts, woman.You want a  for your views  Go work for a radio station in the private sector, or get a newspaper column,you can.The BBC has, in the main, behaved well over Covid. But always with the exception of Newsnight.Always with the exception of Maitlis.IF you remember, just before lockdown, it was rumoured that the Spice Girls might get back together.There were gigs planned for next month.“Christ help us,” we all thought. And then we all got down on our knees and thanked Covid for scuppering that idea.Now, however, lockdown looks like it will be eased. Which means they might well fix some new dates. Yikes, etc.I suppose we could tell them the latest scientic news. Singing, apparently, is really bad for spreading the virus everywhere.Choirs and stuff have been banned in some countries. So we could try that line.But then I suppose Sporty and Co might well reply: “You could hardly call what we do singing.”DID you see those hacks questioning the Prime Minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings on Monday One after another they all stepped up, wreathed in self-importance.And all asked exactly the same question. Over and over again. And therefore got exactly the same response.What the hell is the point of that Did they all think that they would be the only person to ask: “Why is it one law for you and one law for everyone , Mr Cummings ”Did they think they were dead clever coming up with that line Incredible. Thick as a plate of mince, some of us journos.GLORY, glory. Denmark is to open its borders once again.You can travel to the countryyou can prove that you’re dating someone Danish.In my case I think I’d choose one of the models Maja Krag or Terese Pagh Teglgaard – crazy names, crazy girls.

Cambridge University was closed down.And so the young Isaac Newton was forced to leave his studies andhome to Grantham, Lincs, under lockdown.And during this spare time he invented the branch of mathematics known as calculus.

All done under lockdown.And what have I done  Put out the patio furniture and completed a giant jigsaw puzzle of my own face.Depressing, innit FUNNY, isn’t it, how most of the people screaming blue murder about Dominic Cummings were fervent anti-Brexiteers Cummings was the key architect of the Vote Leave campaign – and the Remoaners utterly loathe the bloke.Among the Remoaners screaming their little heads off are a bunch of Church of England bishops.These include Leeds Bishop “Nick” Baines, who has referred to the Prime Minister as a “liar” and a “bully”.No wonder the Church of England’s attendances have collapsed over the past  years.The Cof E is another institution that has lost its moral compass and is utterly out of step with the rest of the country.THE Chinese government is bullying Hong Kong once again.Thousands of armed police are on the streets, battling protesters.The row is over a new law which makes it a criminal offence to take the p*** out of the Chinese national anthem.Only a deeply insecure totalitarian state would create such a law.Meanwhile, the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, has told his people to “prepare for war”.I don’t know who against.I think Xi has finally understood that the rest of the world is sick to the back teeth of his foul, bullying, communist dictatorship.And once this Chinese pandemic is over we might be more inclined to stand up for ourselves.THE Home ­Secretary Priti Patel is determined to stop economic migrants flooding here from across the Channel.She wants new powers to send boats back to France.

More than a third said they would bring the majority of their furloughed workers back part-time from August.Mr Sunak has already announced that employers will be able to furlough staff part-time, but has yet to announce details of how this will work.Jonathan Geldart, boss of the IoD, said: The furlough scheme is protecting millions of jobs. Business leaders know that the Governments support cant be infinite, but the ugly truth is thattheres no money coming in the door, many firms will be forced to make dficult decisions come August.Directors will be fighting tooth and nail to avoid this scenario. There is hope that as more areas of the economyto work, more companies can keep people on board.However, despite best efforts, many firms simply wont be able to work at full capacity for the foreseeable future and theres no magic wand to lt demand back up again.The Government must soften the blow by introducing as much flexibility as possible into the furlough system. The more flexible the scheme is, the better firms can recover, and the fewer jobs will rely on state subsidy.With the prospect of job losses and businesses struggling to create new roles in the months ahead, the spotlight will be on our training system.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also attempted to master Japanese during two seasons at League club Nagoya Grampus Eight.Gary explains why sticking to your mother tongue could be an own goal, both on and off the pitch . . .MASTERING a language is one of the most important things you can do.That became apparent to me when, on arriving in Spain, I decided to buy some furniture.Keen that my bedside cabinets had drawers, I asked the shop assistantthey had two tables “con cojones”.The poor woman burst out laughing and explained that in Spanish, drawers are “cajones” not “cojones” — I’d accidentally asked for two tables with testicles.I couldn’t speak a word of Spanish when I signed for Barcelona but I knew I needed to learn the lingo.I had realised that players at foreign clubs who immerse themselves in the culture do better on the pitch than those who don’t.I looked to greats such as Kevin Keegan, who learned German when he joined Hamburg, and Ray Wilkins, who mastered Italian at AC Milan.Then there were others — who I won’t name — who were lured abroad just for the bigger pay packet back in the day and barely lasted a season.I’d studied a small amount of French and German at school but I was so focused on becoming a footballer I didn’t put the effort in.I had a bit of a wake-up call over my lack of language skills on my first day of training.It’s a shock to the system being in a changing room full of blokes bantering and you have no idea what they are saying.Luckily, the team took me under their wing. On the bus to the training grounds Barcelona keeper Andoni Zubizarreta drew a stick man and woman and taught me all the body parts.To get a firmer grip on the language I avoided the ex-pat nightclubs out there and enrolled in a Spanish language class with my then we Michelle and my team-mate Mark Hughes.Poor Mark was only  and struggled with the classes. I think he dropped out after two or three but Michelle and I stuck with it.For two years, three times a week after training, we’d go to school to learn Spanish.It was tough at first as no English was allowed in the classroom, but looking back it did me a world of good.I started playing football when I was small and the skills came naturally. Learning a language was the opposite. It was really hard work and not something that came easily to me.So I made sure I read Spanish newspapers every day and watched the local TV stations. In two months I could get by. After six months I was getting pretty good and in a year I was speaking pretty much fluently.By the time I left in  I was thinking and dreaming in Spanish.From the get go, I made sure I did my post-match interviews in the local language.EvenI didn’t always make sense, it sent out a strong message to the club that I was there for the long haul.Being able to talk to fans gained me a lot of respect and appreciation when I was over there.And when a match goes badly, the pitch can be a really lonely place. But because I was able to speak to my team-mates, it helped me through some tough times.When I went to play for Nagoya Grampus Eight in  it was a whole other story.I took eight months of Japanese lessons before I went out there, and did classes there too. But it is a very dficult language, with a completely dferent alphabet.I learned enough to get by but I was nowhere near as good at Japanese as I was with Spanish.It’s been more than  years since I lived in Barcelona and I’ll admit my Spanish is a bit rusty.Nowadays when I go there I’ll try to speak the language but Spaniards always want to speak to me in English.So many foreigners speak English that it can seem a pointless exercise trying to pick up another tongue.As a nation, we are not great at learning a second language, we can rest on our laurels slightly.But I would argue that it’s more important now than ever to learn, and at the moment we’ve all got the time to spare.Having a second language opens up so many opportun­ities to you and your kids, whether that’s working abroad or in hospitality in the UK.Travel might be shut at the moment, but that won’t be the case for ever and you’ll be giving your family a leg-up during this downtime.Children’s brains are like sponges, they pick up languages so much faster and better when they are younger.And there are so many online tools and courses that I wish I’d had at my disposal when I was first learning.Although I’d always warn against online translation tools — they give a very literal translation which doesn’t always make sense.For example,you type “it’s raining cats and dogs” into Google Translate it won’t mean anything to a foreigner in their own language.Getting kids to do anything can be tricky, as I’m sure mums and dads who are homeschooling have realised by now.In my Celebrity Supply Teacher episode I teach counting to ten in Spanish by doing keepy-ups.Soyou make it fun, it opens up an exciting new world for youngsters which doesn’t involve sitting at a desk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On  April , Mr Cummings drove approximately  miles from his father’s property to Barnard Castle with his we and son. He stated on  May  that the purpose of this drive was to test his resilience to drive to London the following day, including whether his eyesight was sufficiently recovered, his period of self-isolation having ended.Durham Constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castleand have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the Regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.Had a Durham Constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings toto the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.In line with Durham Constabulary’s general approach throughout the pandemic, there is no intention to take retrospective action in respect of the Barnard Castle incident since this would amount to treating Mr Cummings dferently from other members of the public.Durham Constabulary has not taken retrospective action against any other person.By way of further context, Durham Constabulary has followed Government guidance on management of alleged breaches of the regulations with the emphasis on the NPCC and College of Policing Es: Engage, Explain and Encourage before Enforcement.Finally, commentary in the media has suggested that Mr Cummings was in Durham on  April . Mr Cummings denies this and Durham Constabulary have seen insufficient evidence to support this allegation.Therefore Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m good at what I do.”Do  DO  I wasn’t aware, until this series started, that Joey DID anything, but it turns out he’s spent half a letime ­prepping for SAS: Who Dares Wins.For as well as being surprisingly likeable, the guy’s also insanely fit — to an extent that clearly tormented professional athlete Lauren Steadman and suggested Joey could’ve had an amazing military careerhe wasn’t, in the words of one SAS interrogator, “poncing about on TV telling everyone what he f***ing had for breakfast”.Apart from “the naughtiest blisters ever”, Joey had breezed through every section of the C show, until the finale when “escape and evasion” gave way to the interrogation phase that’s designed to “prepare the recruits for enemy capture”.Who the hell was going to want to capture Joey Essex, outside of the Celebrity First Dates booking office, wasn’t explained, and it doesn’t even do to ask such questions of SAS: WDW as the whole thing will unravelyou start pulling at those threads.It’s always best just to enjoy the entertainment, which involved giving Joey and the other five finalists the cover story that they were working for the Scottish Highland Mountain Rescue Board.The trouble with giving Joey a cover story, it emerged, was that it dislodged every other piece of information he’d ever learned from his brain.Key to surviving this task, as they’d all been instructed, was to drip-feed the truth back to “Dilksy”, the monstrous great slaphead who always appears at this point, and his fellow interrogators.Whether they locked him in a cage, dunked him in water or threatened to kiss him, though, Joey just kept denying everything and repeating the story.With the clock ticking, something had to give and eventually it did, after the entire SAS: WDW team had concluded, more in sorrow than anything : “He’s not even playing the village idiot, he’s trying hard not to be.”The end, when it finally came, was a bit of an anti-climax.Joey just sloped off, in a bit of a huff.Helen Skelton and Nikki Sanderson quickly followed and the winners were declared to be DJ Locksmith and Lauren Steadman.A worthy choice, even though some of us were still probably trying to work out how she made it through the drown-proofing task“no allowances are made”.If you take this show too seriously, though, you’ll miss the joy and point of SAS: WDW.It’s not offering contestants a fast-track into the SAS any more than Harry’s Heroes will form the spine of the next England squad.The reasons the show deserves to be put on a pedestal are its extraordinary entertainment value and the fact it’s proved, to my complete satisfaction, that Joey Essex isn’t putting anything on. He really is a total dingwad.Progress, people.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month.

The popular host was absent from Wednesday nightaposs broadcast after the BBC ruled the programme breached impartiality rules over its coverage of Boris Johnsonaposs top aide. In her introduction to Tuesdayaposs show, she said the Prime Ministeraposs chief adviser had broken the rules and the country can see that, and itaposs shocked the Government cannot. The BBC said while Maitlis had been scheduled to present last nightaposs edition of the programme, Katie Razzall would take her place. However, in the early hours of Thursday morning Emily tweeted to say it was her decision not to appear on the show. She said: So grateful to my friend and excellent colleague Katie Razzall for stepping in this evening . She did so because I asked for the night off - knowing tonight’s prog would be in the most excellent hands. [sic] Newsnight editor Esme Wren said on Twitter Maitlis had not been replaced tonight in response to the BBC statement and that the programmeaposs staff work as a team throughout. Razzall also said her fellow presenter had not been asked by the BBC to take tonight off, adding that she certainly wouldnapost have agreed to present the showshe thought that was the case. In the Newsnight opening, Maitlis said: The longer ministers and the Prime Minister tell us he worked within [the rules], the more angry the response to this scandal is likely to be. He was the man, remember, who always got the public mood, who tagged the lazy label of elite on those who disagreed. He should understand that public mood now - one of fury, contempt and anguish. The National Union of Journalists criticised the BBC over its handling of the row. General secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: At a time of national crisis, frank and fearless journalism that scrutinises and holds this Government to account is more necessary than ever. She said it was clear as day that Mr Cummings breached lockdown rules, adding: Journalists should be congratulated for holding policymakers to account for actions that risk a monumental breach of trust during a public health crisis. The BBC said in a statement on Wednesday staff had been reminded of the guidelines around impartiality following the broadcast, adding that the corporation must uphold the highest standards of due impartiality in its news output. The statement added: Weaposve reviewed the entirety of last nightaposs Newsnight, including the opening section, and while we believe the programme contained fair, reasonable and rigorous journalism, we feel that we should have done more to make clear the introduction was a summary of the questions we would examine, with all the accompanying evidence, in the rest of the programme. As it was, we believe the introduction we broadcast did not meet our standards of due impartiality. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan branded the BBC statement utterly disgraceful, adding that the BBC is chucking one of its best journalists under the bus for telling the truth. His words were echoed by journalist and former Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason, who said the decision made him sick. He tweeted: Every word Maitlis said was true: truth is the criterion of real journalism.

You can unsubscribe at any time.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailLet’s begin with something Boris Johnson can’t bring himself to say but the rest of us know: Dominic Cummings broke the rules. It is as simple as that. His actions were an insult to the millions of people across Britain who have sacriced so much during this pandemic. In recent months, families have been forced to make the most agonising of decisions. People have been unable to see loved ones. Grandparents have been denied the chance to hold newborn grandchildren. Some of the most vulnerable in society have had to isolate alone. In the most tragic circumstances, people haven’t been able to say goodbye at the funerals of friends or loved ones.  The lockdown has been dficult for us all. There is no denying that. We miss each other. But, people have obeyed the rules because they understand the importance of our shared common goal our national purpose. Stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. That’s why, when the revelations about Dominic Cummings’ behaviour broke over the weekend, people were angry. And during the endless hours of press conferences over the Bank Holiday weekend, people were looking for an apology, a resignation or a plausible explanation from Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings about what happened. None was forthcoming.  Instead, we got a very simple message: it is one rule for them, another rule for everybody . I share people’s frustrations, not just because of the actions of one adviser, but because this has become a national distraction at a moment of national crisis. This was the week when we should have been talking about how we ease the lockdown safely. How we restart our economy, support businesses, get more children back to school.  Instead, the Prime Minister’s unwillingness or inability to do the right thing has left the Government looking untrustworthy, unprincipled. And worst of all they have undermined the very public health advice that is necessary to keep us all safe, just to keep one powerful aide in his job. In times like this, we need good government. A government that we can trust. A government that is entirely focused on saving lives. So, I say to the Prime Minister: we cannot go on like this. We cannot lose another week to this farce. We need to get back on track. When I was elected leader of the Labour Party, I made a promise to the British people. That I would work constructively with the Government. Challenging them when I thought mistakes were being made, offering my support when that was the right thing to do. I stand by that promise. That is why I will work constructively with the Government to help us through the next phase of this pandemic. The Prime Minister has promised a ‘world-beating’ test, track and trace system, when in fact what most people are looking for is a system that will work and will keep them safe. For Labour, that means rapidly increasing the amount of testing to at least a quarter of a million a day. It means recruiting an army of over , so-called ‘contract tracers’. And it means a nationwide phone app up and running by the  June, as we were previously promised. For the British people, it also means providing reassurance at time of huge anxiety. If you or a family member have symptoms, or you have been told to go into isolation, you want to know as soon as possible whether you have got this awful virus.

Labouraposs Rosena Allin-Khan said Mr Hancockaposs reaction was an insult to the , people who have died of Covid- - saying the need for a working test and trace system is not a joke. NHS Test and Trace will officially launch across England today with the help of , contact tracers, although an accompanying app is still delayed by several weeks. But today NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson warned very key bits of the Governmentaposs test and trace strategy are not yet in place. Mr Hancock originally said the NHSX contact tracing app would be an integral part of the system - but that has been delayed following a trial on the Isle of Wight. But Ms Burley challenged him on why Test and Trace has been rolled out now, without the app in place. She said: The problem is youaposve rushed it forward havenapost you  Because you want to take the headlines away from Dominic Cummings. Youaposve brought it forward. It should have been  June, when the app is being launched at the same time.  Mr Hancock said: Itaposs priceless, Kay. Iaposm normally accused of delaying these things, bringing them in too slowly. Itaposs, I, I committed to getting this in mid-May...itaposs just about mid-May. You canapost accuse me both of... Ms Burley interrupted: OK, you talked about the app in mid-May, didnapost you, Health Secretary, and weaposve still not got that app. Mr Hancock started to laugh loudly. You said the app was absolutely essential to this track and trace, she said. The app is still not ready until next week at the earliest. Maybe after that. Yet youaposve brought this forward. I suppose many of my viewers will think itaposs not a laughing matter. Mr Hancock said: Yes, well. I canapost quite work out whether youaposre telling me that Iaposve gone too slow or too fast. I think weaposve gone at just the right speed. Ms Burley said: I tell you what, I donapost think my viewers know. I think theyaposre as confused as I am. Clary it for us. Mr Hancock said the app was helpful and was working on the Isle of Wight. He added: But thereaposs a reason we havenapost brought it in right at the start, which is that asking people to isolate, eventheyaposre healthy, because the NHS has got in contact and informed them that they are in higher risk because theyaposve been in contact with somebody who has tested positive, that is quite a big change. One of the things we learnt in the pilot on the Isle of Wight was that getting people used to that idea is important to do before we then also add the technological capability, the app, on top.  Rosena Allin-Khan said: What an insult. At least , people have died of Covid- in the UK. [The Government] abandoned community testing. With a proper test and trace system in place months ago, thousands would have been saved. This is not a joke. This has been painful for so many families. NHS Providers Chief Chris Hopson told the BBC: Weaposre in the process of building test and trace. There will be a group of contact tracers who will be readymorning but there are still very key bits of test and trace that still need to be built. Mr Hopson said the speed of testing needed to be improved, comparing international standards of having tests back within  hours with reports of tests taking up to three to five days, as well as referencing the need to provide support locally.

The number of people people who are allowed into the resort each day will be restricted. A online booking system may be introduced and all guests may have to order in advance to guarantee entry.  We are still working through precisely how this will work, and our approach may evolve in line with Government guidance, so please bear with us, the spokesperson added. Staff will also have to monitor their own health and not travelthey are feeling unwell or have a temperature or cough. Everyone who arrives at Alton Towers will be subject to a temperature check. The spokesperson continued: Whilst we never want to turn anyone away, unfortunatelysomeone arrives at the Resort with a high temperature they will not be allowed to enter.

Just under , people signed up to say they were willing to meet a stranger over video link under lockdown. People have been virtually meeting over the past few days and reporting that they found it overwhelmingly positive. From farmers to Zumba teachers, this was a chance to hear about someone ’s le. So many hundreds signed up after the deadline that we decided to do a second round of Britain Connects in early June. We will also re-match anyone whose partner didn’t show up in the first round. Andyou feel inspired by these stories, sign up here. Sue Shelmerdine, , a furloughed haberdashery assistant from Surrey, meets Joelle, , working from home in tech in London. Both are living alone.  Born five decades apart, before the coronavirus crisis Sue Shelmerdine and Joelle’s paths might have been unlikely to cross. Conservative Leave voter Sue lives alone in Surrey, close to her two daughters and three grandchildren. Although she is , the former NHS worker has no plans to retire yet and works part-time in the haberdashery department at a fashion and home store.  Joelle lives alone in London and works in the technology industry. She has two brothers who live nearby but most of her family is now abroad. The -year-old lived a busy, cosmopolitan le before lockdown but is now working from home. Meanwhile, Sue has been furloughed but is desperate toto work. Introducing herself, Joelle says, “I have been so excited to meet someone new, someone dferent. “I like to connect with people I wouldn’t usually talk to, away from my own circle of friends. “I live alone and it has been dficult since lockdown. “I usually work in Central London and see so many people during my commute but the last few months have seen so many changes – especially not seeing family and friends.” Sue can relate to this. “I miss seeing my two children a lot,” she says. “But this pandemic has made my neighbours and I connect with each other. Nobody really knew one another before but we’ve started to get to know each other, especially when we’ve been coming out for the pm clap every Thursday.”  The pair have something  in common which is keeping them going – exercise. Sue says: “I moved into this house about two years ago and the garden has needed a lot of attention. So these last few weeks have been perfect for me to do some work in it. But I do go on my daily walks, which I love. I am very fond of walking but I miss my pilates classes, which I attend twice a week.” Joelle, who also enjoys going for walks, proudly tells Sue about joining online pilates classes, which she has signed up to during lockdown. The pair talk about the new skills they are learning, with Sue growing her own vegetables and continuing with her knitting while Joelle is keen to learn some new languages. Joelle laughs as she tells Sue about her disasters in her textile classes at school. She says: “I did break the sewing machine a few times in textiles, I even used to hide in the materials cupboard, so I didn’t have to take part. “My mum always says to me, the new generation don’t repair anything, instead we buy new things. “But the older generation have the skills, like knitting and sewing to repair items instead of replacing.” Joelle speaks about her concerns for the future and how the coronavirus will change the way we live. She tells Sue: “I used the Tube to get to work. “Even up to the last day before lockdown, the Tube was rammed with people breathing down on me. “I now can’t imagine doing my commute again soon.” Afterwards, Joelle says she was pleased to meet Sue and delighted to find a shared love of pilates. And Sue enjoyed meeting someone younger than her and found Joelle interesting. Accountant Harish Sharma, , from Cheshire, meets Zumba teacher Janina Bacon from Blackpool At first glance they couldn’t be more dferent but when accountant and entrepreneur Harish Sharma met energetic Zumba teacher, Janina Bacon, the conversation flowed.Harish and Janina voted in dferent ways at the general election, but over Zoom, the pair didn’t take long to get chatting away about everything from parenthood to politics, discovering a shared love of physical exercise and their hopes for a more positive post-Covid world along the way.As Janina, , who lives in Blackpool says: “It’s been very hard and strange hasn’t it…we’ve never had anything like it, have we  Le is like a tightrope at the moment - you question yourself, are you doing enough, have you done enough to protect yourself   A Zumba teacher and mental health trainer, Janina lost her job a week before the full lockdown came into place. As she says: “I’ve had a little bit of a bad time. But I’m looking to start a mental health group, a whole new chapter here. If people don’t stick to the rules there’s going to be more sadness.”“You might be the new Joe Wicks,” laughs Harish.The conservative and Leave voter adds: “I don’t know where it’s going to end up. Economically that’s where the biggest hit is for all of us.”For Harish, , lockdown has been an emotional experience. He lives in Cheshire with his we and as well supporting his own parents and in-laws, he’s been worrying about his four children.His two sons are doctors, both working on the front line in Manchester and as he tells Janina: “One of them got the Covid but fortunately he recovered.“Your mind goes in a bad place for a short while but you have to calm yourself down.”Janina, who didn’t vote in the election, has seen friends and family become unwell too, but she hopes there will be a lasting positive response to the crisis too.As she says: “When it comes to community you are right, we’re getting into those networks, on Whatsapp and other places.”“Even this - what we’re doing now, is exactly that,” Harish adds.“Before this we wouldn’t have got involved in something like this.

But how much is our Monarch actually worth  Back in , her Majesty ranked th on the Sunday Times Rich List. Her incredible wealth is made up of property, jewels, horses and art. According to Forbes, the Queenaposs personal net worth back in  was a staggering £million. Her husband Prince Philip is thought to have a personal wealth of about £million. The following year, the Sunday Times calculated the value of the entire Royal Family - which theyaposve estimated at billion, which is about £billion. However working out the Queenaposs finances is far from simple, as there are many restrictions and technicalities on some of the things she has to her name. Many of the things she owns, she owns as Sovereign on behalf of the nation rather than owning them personally. For example, while she owns the Balmoral and Sandringham Estates personally having inherited them from her father, the official Royal residences - including Buckingham Palace - must be passed onto her successor.  This means Prince Charles will automatically own them, but again only as Sovereign, when the Queen dies. The same rules apply to many of the art treasures in the Royal Collection and most famously, the Crown Jewels. The Queen pays for her day-to-day le using three separate pots of cash - the Sovereign Grant, the Privy Purse and her personal money. The Sovereign Grant is the money the Government gives the Queen every year to support her work.  The Privy Purse is cash generated by the Duchy of Lancaster - a portfolio land, property and other assets of about , hectares in England and Wales.It has existed since  to provide an income for  the Sovereign  – who is also known as the Duke of Lancaster .But the Queen canapost do what she wants with the Duchy – it is managed and run for her – but she receives all the net profits, which is millions of pounds each year.

Just weeks after many parts of England and Wales were deluged with floodwater, the spring drought has seen gardens wilt, farmers fret over parched crops and reservoir levels drop. The Environment Agencysaid on Thursday that most water companies have appropriate reserves, and it stressed its calls for people to use water wisely should not deter anyone from regular hand-washing as part of the fight against Covid-. But it confirmed United Utilities has applied to take water from a Cumbrian lake to help with supplies in the county. It warned further measures may be needed in the north-west of Englandthe dry spell continues.The Met Office is predicting some regions, especially in the south of England, will record the lowest May rainfall figures on record when the final statistics are collated on Monday.But a spokesman for Water UK, the trade association representing water companies, said: There are no plans for any hosepipe bans this summer. It is always worth using water wisely, though, especially at the moment when people are spending more time at home. Taking a few simple steps to save water reduces the stress on the environment and the water network.  An EA spokesman said most companies across the country have appropriate water reserves for this time of year.While dry weather since late March has led to a decline in some reservoirs, this is not unusual during a hot and dry spell, and they can recover quickly when the rain s, they added.The EA said United Utilities, the company which supplies water to the North West, has applied for a drought order to take supplies from Ennerdale Water in the Lake District to sustain supplies in west Cumbria. South East Water has asked its customers to help us by taking simple steps, such as not watering lawns, reusing paddling pool water and only using dishwashers and washing machines on full loads to help make sure there is enough water for everyone.  The firm said it has been pumping an additional  million litres of water a day through its network and water being used on DIY projects and gardening has contributed to an additional % of water use. Met Office spokesman Oli Claydon said: May has been exceptionally dry. Some regions are on track to have possibly the driest May on record. Mr Claydon said the official figures for May will be published next week, but they are likely to be record breaking in some regions - especially in the south of England - but not for the UK as a whole. Up to Tuesday, only .mm of rain had fallen on average across the UK, and only mm had fallen on average in England since the beginning of March. Forecasters said there is no appreciable rain expected in the next week, with an area of high pressure sitting to the east set to continue dominating the weather for at least the next week.  Only the far north of Scotland is expected to see some rain early next week. Temperatures peaked at .C at Heathrow Airport on Tuesday. The highest temperature recorded so far this year is .C at Santon Downham, Suffolk, on May . But Mr Claydon said this mark could be broken on Friday somewhere around the Moray Firth, in northern Scotland, where the Foehn Effect will produce exceptionally warm conditions.

From Friday people will be able to meet up with friends and relatives from other households, one household at a time. Scots can also take part in some non-contact sports including golf, angling and outdoor swimming. Garden centres, drive-through restaurants and recycling centres will also be reopened.

A legal limit will not be put on how far people will be allowed to travel for recreation but the First Minister said the strong advice of the Scottish Government was to stay within five miles. She added: We simply donapost want, in this phase, large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or beauty spots. Crowds of people, eventheyaposre trying to social distance, bring more risk than we judge is acceptable at this point. The First Minister asked that the number of people together between the two households should not exceed a maximum of eight people, along with asking that meetings do not take place with a dferent household in the same day. She said: I know how much all of you, all of us, will be looking forward to seeing family and friends for the first time in a while, but how we do this will be vital. Before you meet up with people from another household, you should stop, think, read the guidance and make sure youaposre protecting yourself and others.  In particular, you must stay outdoors and stay two metres away from people from the other household - that is crucial. The First Minister told those who had been asked to shield for  weeks due to an underlying health condition that they have not been forgotten, adding that measures were being drawn up to move to less of a blanket approach that reflects the circumstances of the inidual. Ms Sturgeon said her confidence in the move to phase one was boosted by the initiation of the Test and Protect scheme in Scotland, which is aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. Under the scheme, those who are symptomatic will be tested and their contacts traced should they have the virus.  The First Minister also said people will be able to help to stop the spread of the virus by continuing to social distance. She added: Test and Protect will be a crucial part of our efforts to control this virus in the weeks ahead, but it will not do it on its own. The use of face coverings, social distancing and hand washing, the First Minister said, will remain key to tackling the spread of the virus. Ms Sturgeon said that a downward trend in coronavirus cases was sustained and unmistakable.

The country has seen , more deaths than usual since March , three days before the lockdown was announced. This means the virus has directly or indirectly killed  people per million, analysis by the Financial Times suggests. That is a higher death rate than any other country providing detailed data, including Italy and the US. Italy was the European country hardest hit by the virus in the early stages of the crisis, although the UK and US have subsequently recorded more excess deaths. Despite the US suffering more than , deaths, the highest number of fatalities in the world, its excess death rate is still lower than the UK as it has a population of  million. The data used by the Financial Times was from national statistical organisations in  countries, including all European countries hard hit by coronavirus. These were the only countries for which enough information could be found to make proper comparisons. The actual number of excess deaths in the UK is the highest in Europe, with only the US recording more globally. Peru is the only country that has recorded a higher percentage increase in deaths than the UK since the pandemic started. While countries like China and Russia have suffered many fatalities, the overall death rate is much lower than the UK because of their large populations.

It was deeply insulting. There was no apology for the behaviour of Dominic Cummings. There was no acknowledgement of the anger it caused and no acceptance that it had undermined the Government’s message at a crucial moment in the battle against coronavirus. Calls for an inquiry were swatted away with the arrogance of an oligarch bored of counting his money. The Prime Minister repeatedly claimed the allegations against Cummings were . When asked to substantiate this allegation he declined. Yet as this paper has accurately reported, Cummings did flout the lockdown restrictions, the police did speak to his family and he did make a trip, against the clear instructions, to Barnard Castle. When this defence failed, Mr Johnson resorted to the cheapest trick in the book by accusing anyone asking perfectly legitimate questions of playing party politics. Nobody is playing a game here. There is genuine concern that the public will lose faith in the lockdown measures which could result in a second spike and yet more deaths. On Thursday the Government will roll out its test and trace programme that will require hundreds of thousands of people to self-isolate for  days, whether they are infected or not. Mr Johnson was hesitant to say whether this was compulsory or not – it will, in fact, be voluntary – because he knows he can no longer tell the public what to do when his chief adviser is making the rules up as he goes along.

The bodies of  men and women, all wearing identical clothing down to their Nike trainers, wo had all sememingly died without a struggle. There was no trace of violence or blood - and those lying dead looked so peaceful they could have been sleeping. But the reality was far more sinister. These  women and  men were members of the strict Heavenaposs Gate cult and they had all willingly made the decision to end their own lives. Led by former music teacher, Marshall Applewhite, whose body was also found among the dead, they believed their deaths were merely a transition. The extreme cult told its followers that following their suicides, they would transcend their earthly bodies, or containers to start a new le on board an alien spacecraft. Applewhite told his believers that the space ship was hiding behind the Hale Bop comet, which was passing the earth at the time of the mass suicide on March , . Harrowing images of the bodies of the Heavenaposs Gate followers, all in the same outfits, covered in a sheets and being loaded into mortuary trucks, were beamed around the world. As well as their unorms of dark coloured tracksuites and Nike trainers, Applewhiteaposs followers also wore badges declaring they were aposHeavenaposs Gate Away Clubapos. One of the officers at the scene, Detective Rick Scully, has vivid memories of the dayaposs tragedy.  He said: It was like being in the Twilight Zone. We were wandering from room to room to room, and every room we went into we were finding bodies. Youaposre thinking aposwhen is this going to end  How many bodies are going to be in here  How many rooms are there to this place apos Because every room we went in had bodies stacked up like cordwood. Applewhite had started his career in the Armed Forces before going on the teach music at several universities. But following the death of his father in , he fell into a deep depression and left his teaching post. The following year, Applewhite met nurse Bonnie Nettles and the two formed an incredibly close friendship, where they would discuss mysticism. They decided they were aposine mesengersapos and opened a book shop and teaching centre to spead their message before taking what they viewed as their mission on a tour of the US. It was on Applewhite and Nettles travels that he was arrested and jailed for failing toa hire car on time - and he used his time behind bars to develop his theology. When he was released the pair headed to Calornia, where they recruited a commited group of followers to their cause. Their message was extreme - anyone who joined his cult would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed. Over the years this morphed into a belief that the human body was simply a container for the soul, and this would be placed in a new body when they reached the spaceship. As the cult grew, so did its ability to make money and they put down roots. But then, in , Applewhite was dealt a devastating blow when Nettles died from cancer. He told his followers that she had transcended to the aposnext levelapos because she had too much energy to remain on earth. It was after Nettlesapos death that Applewhite really tightened his grip on the cult and he encouraged its members to view him as a Christ-like figure. Throughout the s Heavenaposs Gate started to focus on the suppression of sexual desire with Applewhite and seven of his following even going to the extreme s of surgically castrating themselves. He claimed aposnext levelapos beings had no sexual organs and also forced all the members to wear matching, gender neutral, clothes and to have the same haircuts.By the s, Heavenaposs Gate were living in their mansion in Santa Fe and wanted to get their message out to a wider audience.They recorded to videos appealing for people to joiin them for the last chance to evacuate earth. When Applewhite heard the comet Hale-Bop was approaching the planet, he convinced his followers that Nettles was on board a ship hiding behind it and this was her sign that she wanted he and the rest of his cult to join her.  But the only way they could do this was to commit suicide and leave their aposvesselsapos behind.In March , the group completely cut themselves off from the world and recorded their farewell messages. Applewhite also planned to kill himself because he had said that the group would ascend during his letime, so appointing a successor was unfeasible.Wearing their matching unorms, the cult took barbituates, in some cases in apple sauce, and drank alcohol - and slowly, over the next three days, they all died.

Thousands of the locusts can be seen flying among buildings, as terried residents lock themselves inside. Akanksha Badaya, who witnessed the spectacular scene, said many of the flying insects had also forced their way through doors and windows in the city of Jaipur. She said: They enter through small gaps and make their way to our kitchens and bedrooms. Itaposs non-stop cleaning for us. I hope they will soon leave. An earlier video showed the bugs turning the sky black as the locusts took over every available space. A man, who filmed the insects, can be heard behind the camera: “There are billions and trillions.  “There are uncountable numbers of locusts flying in the sky, this is something I have never ever seen in my le. Desert locusts can travel up to km per day eating up every bit of greenery in their path. The swarms have been invading the country since April, leaving a trail of crop damage as they ravaged fields. The recent locust attack is believed to be the worst in decades.

Pupils will spend part of the time learning in school and will study at home for the remainder.Class sizes will be signicantly reduced to accommodate social distancing.The role of teachers will include curriculum-setting, lesson preparation and creation of class rotas.Recycling centres across the city will resume operations from next week.Facilities at Hazlehead, Bucksburn and Tullos will operate normal summer opening hours from am to .pm Monday-Friday and am to .pm on Saturdays and Sundays.The Tullos centre will be shut on Wednesdays.Physical distancing measures will be in place, and the range of material being accepted has been reduced to support these.Grass-cutting will resume from Monday, with priority areas such as open leisure spaces and cemeteries identied.More outdoor activity will also be permitted under the first phase, and people will be allowed to sit in parks as long as they are socially distanced.Temporary measures will be introduced on streets in the city to allow people to walk, cycle and queue for buses and shopping. These include pedestrianisation, pavement-widening, temporary bike lanes and one-way walking systems.Work on the new measures is to begin in the coming days.Some restrictions to businesses will also be relaxed, and construction contractors will be able to focus on tasks which maintain physical distancing.The council has pledged to work with bodies including Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive to ensure measures are adhered to.Council co-leader Councillor Douglas Lumsden said: #Our response to Phase  is aligned with government guidance and seeks to protect people and the place as we start on what will be a challenging journey in the weeks and months ahead.“For the council this involves reinstating services where we can – and today we are sharing details – while considering the impact on us as an institution and of course our customers and staff.“Today is about very much looking forward. By working together and continuing to respect the necessary rules on physical distancing, we can begin to start to build back better.”Co-leader Jenny Laing added: #I am sure people will welcome the chance to again use public outdoor spaces for recreational purposes, the reinstatement of some key services in the community, and some businesses beginning to restart.“What matters most is that we do this in a safe fashion by continuing to follow national guidance, accepting this will be a gradual process, requiring patience and understanding.“The council will share updates on our website and via social media as they become available, and I would urge everyone to familiarise themselves with the changes and to follow our channels as we move through the route map.”A Scottish Government review will be conducted every three weeks to decide whether to move to the next phase.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da7ee8a328775.01202982-835x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen university study examines lockdown impact on older people","story":"The impact of lockdown on the physical activity and wellbeing of older people is being investigated by researchers at Aberdeen University.The study will consider the impact of Covid- restrictions on feelings of loneliness and so-called ‘help-seeking behaviours’ – such as making GP appointments, or asking for help with shopping.It will also gauge how public health messages are being interpreted by those aged  and over, and the impact on their levels of exercise.The results of the study will help inform potential policy decisions on support for older people, who are more likely to have to continue to shield themselves for a longer period than the rest of the population due to their increased vulnerability.The study is being led by Dr Kathryn Martin, an epidemiologist who specialises in developing interventions based around physical activity to help older adults, particularly those living with arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions.Using a network of walking groups based in the north-east of Scotland as the basis for her research, Dr Martin hopes to gain valuable insights that might help develop interventions for older people.She explained: #It is widely recognised that prolonged home confinement is likely to have a far greater impact on older people, particularly in terms of loneliness and reduced physical activity leading to increased frailty.#With that in mind we’re trying to understand how Covid- restrictions and associated messages have been interpreted and implemented by older people, and the impact on levels of physical activity, loneliness, and health management.#These are all important issues for the over-s, some of whom may be managing chronic health conditions, and whose general health and well-being relies on regular exercise and social contact.#By understanding these issues we can think about possible interventions – for example public health messaging directed at this age group – which will support them in keeping active and socially engaged within the context of this pandemic.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"my lockdown diary by newburgh mathers pupil angus donohoe","story":"My name is Angus and I am seven years old.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

May   marked the end # in Europe at least # of a hard and brutal six year war which took its toll on the lives of families in the UK and across the world.No wonder folk celebrated when the Nazis surrendered in Germany.We#re nowhere near ready to celebrate just yet, and coronavirus will be with us for a while to come, but at least we know we#ll get through this together."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday to you 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"in your night garden","story":"Sara MilneUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIn summer, with light and longer evenings and warmer weather, it’s great to be able to relax in the garden until late. By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll adventure saddles up for public support","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe owner of an Inveraray equine and outdoor activity centre is looking for customers# help as lockdown bites.It#s fair to say Andy Cameron could have had an easier start to running Argyll Adventure.The business has operated at Dalchenna Farm for two decades in its current format and -year-old Andy took over the reins at the end of .Argyll Adventure#s bread and butter is horse riding # trekking through the hills above Loch Fyne.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

two key factors -the scientic andmedical advice confirms it can be done in a way that will not disrupt efforts to control the virus andthere is sufficient PPE and other hygiene measures in place.Following Ms Sturgeons announcement in parliament, the Scottish Government published its strategic framework for the re-opening of schools.Here, well detailwhat parents need to know ahead of their childsto the classroom.When will schools re-open Schools in Scotland are set to re-open on August .This is earlier than planned for some schools - but the universal approach is being advised by the Scottish Government.Teachers are set toto the classroom by June to plan and prepare for the new blended model of learning.Some pupils set to start P or S may also receive some in-school experience in late June, to help ensure they are supported to make the next steps in their education.Critical childcare will continue until August to ensure the ongoing provision for key worker and vulnerable children.How will the blended model work Under this approach, children will have a mixture of in-school and in-home learning.According to the framework, this is reliant on consistent and easy-to-use in-home materials which are \"intended to support and complement, but not replicate\" in-school learning.To help disadvantaged pupils, a further poundm was announced to provide laptops and other technology for the home learning.However the document notes: \"No matter how well planned in-home learning is, it is not the same as having effective learning and teaching within the school environment, led by teachers.\"The blended model will be kept under constant review.How will pupils social distance For the first phase of re-opening, schools are being asked to assess the maximum numbers they can accommodate, with guidance including:Pupils being taught in smaller groupsThese groups will not be mixed, where practicableSeating positions will be re-organised to allow for m gaps between pupilsOutdoor space will be used moreThere will be staggered arrival and departure times, so parents will avoid congregating in playground areasBreaks will be staggered by class to avoid contact from dferent classesTeachers, rather than pupils, will move around classrooms where possibleThere will be enhanced hygiene practices across all schools, including additional cleaning,params: .pushExpanding the learning estateLocal authorities are being advised to look for ways they can maximise the capacity for pupils to benefit from in-school learning as much as possible.One such way they are doing this is through expanding the learning estate.This would mean seeingclassrooms could be made fromoutdoor space,libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference centres.It might also include taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation.Who will be prioritised for in-school learning As set out above, there is likely going to be a finite number of daily places for in-school learning.As a result, to support NHS capacity and other essential work, a priority will be given to the children of keyworkers - but this is only in circumstances where absolutely necessary with no other option for childcare within that household.The remaining allocation is to be distributed across all year groups to ensure every pupils benefits from in-school learning where possible, according to the framework.Local authorities are being advices to use their knowledge of local circumstances to prioritise any groups where need is greatest.Speaking in the Scottish Parliament on Thursday, the First Minister said: ldquoThese arrangements will not represent a completeto normality by August.ldquoBut we judge them to be the most sensible approach we can plan for at this stage.Later in the session, the First Minister said the Scottish Government wants to ensure pupils will be back at school ldquoin a way that allows them to be children.She added: ldquoNone of us relish the prospect of seeing kids, particularly young kids, socially distancing or be as aware of these risks as we will undoubtedly have to require them to be.ldquoTrying to get, for children in

Here are her words:In the past many couldnrsquot read or write and so our history was rolled into the mind and later unravelled when the wheels stopped rolling and the horses were roped for grazing.Cars and lorries may have replaced the old methods of transport, but the importance of our cultural tales remained the same.Stories for children were about joys and adventures of the fairy folk, goblins and broonies.As they grew older, moral messages were concealed in the stories to teach the young person about moral issues.Respecting the earth and all that lived on her made for some wonderful tales about animals and birds why the snakes see all, who painted the eaglesrsquo feather tips, does a blackbird feel a storm coming at the base of his beak Is it not wise to heed the warning of a dog who does not rise to happily welcome the arrival of its master Our lives revolved around such tales, and their inner meanings. The boy who cried wolf was forever with us do not lie!You see, forests hold more than trees and rocks will whisperyou have an ear to listen.Our entire lives were, and are, stories. In my culture we had a teller in every family.In her books about the lives of traditional travellers, and her personal experience of it, she does not overly romanticise it.It could be a hard le, and one often misunderstood or discriminated against, as indeed it still is.But the legacy of stories, told and re-told over campfires, in caravans and kitchens, passed down from generation to generation is a rich and priceless inheritance.I was honoured that she shared a tale with me, albeit online rather than face to face, as these times demand.I believe it is a tradition we should all honour and can learn from.And so here is the story she shared.It has a Tinkerrsquos Leap in it and, who knows, it could refer to the place so named in Woodhall Dean.I have tried as best I can to keep the resonance of Jessrsquos voice in the telling.So sit round your campfire, real or imagined, for Jessrsquos tale:The story I am going to tell is of the Earl of Hell. Aye well that is how folk called him. Irsquom told he was a relative of the famous Jeannie Gordon.Well, he was a handsome lad, and had a roving eye. He also had a knack of walking into trouble.Well one day he was accused of stealing something. He knew he would get no fair hearing in court, and sure enough he didnrsquot.Soon he found himself before a dour judge, who donned his black cap and pronounced that he will be hanged at the light of dawn.Now the Earl had already escaped death three times. Some say he had the blood of Red Ruth in his veins.This time it seemed, he had met his fate. But this young lad was not ready to meet his maker.The hangman did his deadly job but as the Earl fell through the trap door he began a dance at the end of the rope, in which he dislocated his shoulders, threw his legs up in a circle and managed to free himself.The jailers were aghast, and disbelief momentarily paralysed their responses.This gave the Earl time to scuffle to his feet and flee up the steps. No door was locked, for nobody had expected the need of it.The lad jumped onto a horse and rode at speed. His horsemanship was, of course, a skill honed from childhood and he rode to freedom.However, a guard was likewise a skilled rider and took chase after him.Perhaps the Earl eased up on his horse for a moment, believing he was well away, but soon the sound of galloping told him dferent. The guard was closing in.The Earl made his horse fly like the wind. He headed into the trees, hoping to lose his pursuer, but to no avail.The steep sided burn lay ahead. So he rode like the devil towards the precipice.But at the last moment his horse took understandable fright, and stalled, throwing him to the ground.As the Earl stood, his horse would have no more of it and fled.His pursuer now drew a sword that glinted in the morning sun as he charged perhaps after all the Earl of Hell would die in this dawn light.But his title was well earned.He turned towards the precipice and threw caution to the wind and leapt over the edge.The pursuing guard pulled up his horse and watched as the Earl flew over the ravine and landed like a cat on the other side.The guard fumbled for his pistol, but the Earl vanished into the thicket of the wood in moments.The location became known ever after as Tinkerrsquos Leap.And as for the Earl of Hell himself, he was seen again only through the misty visions of drunk men, and the eyes of his sweetheart who did not tell his story till long after he was dead."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-racecourse-cancels-summer-fixtures","story":"It announced earlier this afternoon that all races scheduled for July and August are now cancelled due to

Hopefully, theyrsquoll allow for people to catch up on moments of joy that have been missed or comfort those who have lost.ldquoItrsquos a long way to go but a welcome start.Across the county, plans are afoot to reopen golf courses, bowling greens and garden centres.The First Minister is also expected to give the green light to construction sites to restart as long as social distancing and personal protective equipmentcan be provided.Schools will open on August  but teaching staff are expected tonext month and some pupils who face transitioning from nursery to P and primary to secondary school are likely to come into their new school at the end of next month.Phase one of the Scottish Governmentrsquos four phase route out of lockdown is expected to be confirmed by the First Minister this afternoonwhen she announces her review of the current lockdown restrictions.Last week Ms Sturgeon set out a range of activities which will be allowed including outdoor recreation, meeting with people from other households and letting people who cannot work from hometo workit can be done safely.Iain Gray, East Lothianrsquos MSP, said there were questions which still needed answered by the Scottish Government.He said: ldquoWhile the lsquoroute maprsquo is understandably flexible in its later stages, we do know that there should be some easing of restrictions this week, including theof some non-contact sport, the reopening of garden centres and recycling facilities, and being able to visit friends or relatives albeit only outside and two metres apart.ldquoAfter more than two months in lockdown this initial easing will come as a relief to many.ldquoHowever, there are still many issues the Scottish Government need to clary about the way forward, including the expansion of testing to implement the test, trace, isolate and support strategy, measures to tackle the ongoing emergency in our care homes and plans for repairing the economy as we move out of lockdown.ldquoWe have only reached this stage because people have obeyed lockdown, and reduced infection. It is so important as those restrictions ease that we do not slip into behaving aswe are back to normal. If we do, infections will rise again, and restrictions will be re-imposed, not eased.East Lothian Council leader Willie Innes thanked members of the public in the county for following the lockdown restrictions and the huge community response to help the most vulnerable people.He said: ldquoDealing with the Covid- emergency is highly likely to remain a signicant challenge for some considerable time to come. The Scottish Government has published its four-phase lsquoroute maprsquo aimed at restarting society while suppressing the virus and has confirmed that some restrictions will begin to be eased from the end of this week.ldquoIt is very clear that, as progress remains fragile, the easing of lockdown restrictions must be taken very gradually and incrementally.ldquoThroughout this period we have been following the national advice and will continue to do so. ldquoOn a practical note I, along with many others, will welcome the reopening of the recycling centres and the ability to meet friends and family albeit on a restricted basis. East Lothianrsquos golf courses are being prepared to reopen with changes made to ensure safety for staff and members is a priority.Bill Axon, chief executive of enjoyleisure, which runs golf courses at Musselburgh Old Links and Winterfield, Dunbar, said new policies include sneeze guards, masks and visors for staff and asking for flagsticks to remain in place at all times.Mr Axon said: ldquoFor enjoyleisure, the safety of customers and colleagues come first.ldquoWe have been constantly monitoring the latest Government advice surrounding Covid-, and along with guidance issued by the Scottish Golf and the RA, both courses have been adapted to comply with current social distancing policies.ldquoWe ask all of our customers to adhere to the measures in place, so that we can continue to enjoy golf now and into the future.Indoor sports facilities are not included in the phase one changes but Mr Axon said enjoyleisure, which also oversees the majority of them in the county, would continue to follow government guidance on when they are allowed to reopen.About  per cent of staff with enjoyleisure had been furloughed, with no redundancies made.Mr Axon said there was no alternative work which could be offered and highlighted that the impact of the coronavirus had ldquonot been insignicant in terms of income, with income levels dropping by about pound, per month.Malcolm Duck, who is part of the steering group involved in Scotlandrsquos Golf Coast, said: ldquoWe are waiting for the First Minister to give us the date.ldquoThe impression is it will be Friday but I am not sure that has been confirmed yet. Golf clubs will be able to open and people will be able to get on golf courses.Mr Duck encouraged people to visit the  courses across the county when it was safe to do so.He said: ldquoThe weather is great and it will be great to be able to go out on the golf courses.Billy Mellors, county bowls development officer, said not all bowling clubs in East Lothian would be opening their doors and restrictions would be in place.He said: ldquoDepending on what Nicola Sturgeon says on Thursday, bowling clubs are free to open on Friday with some pretty severe restrictions in place.That will include limiting the number of people allowed on the green at any one time, as well as clubhouses not opening.Brian Whellans, president of Haddington Bowling Club, said club bosses were meeting online todayto discuss a way forward.He said: ldquoThe bowling green is ready to go. Wersquove got a greenkeeper that is paid on a monthly basis.

If at all possible, we are asking that only adult customers visit during this critical time.ldquoAlthough wersquore looking forward to seeing our customers again, I have to confess to being a little nervous about re-opening with these measures in place.ldquoHowever, the safety of customers and staff is our priority and we hope that customers will be patient with us whilst we find our feet and adapt.Under the Scottish Governmentrsquos route map to ease lockdown restrictions, outdoor workplaces can resume with ldquophysical distancing measures in place once guidance is agreed, meaning that garden centres can reopen but not their cafes unless it is for takeaway.County recycling centres are due to open to the public on Monday, with social distancing measures introduced.Phase two of the route out of lockdown, which could be introduced at the next review in three weeksrsquo time, could see theof outdoor markets such as Haddington Farmersrsquo Market and more workplaces open as well as the introduction of more social gatherings.Colin Beattie, MSP for Musselburgh, welcomed the phase one plans.Mr Beattie said: ldquoI am pleased with the cautious approach which the Scottish Government is taking towards releasing lockdown.ldquoThe approach is clear and unambiguous compared to the chaos and contradictions south of the border. The absolute priority is protecting lives.ldquoThe economy is certainly going to be our next priority but we can rebuild the economy while we canrsquot bring back someonersquos mum or dadthey contract a terminal case of Covid-.

Wersquove been erted from the highest moral purpose ndash keeping our minds fixed on the loss of fellow human beings and the government decisions which were involved in their deaths ndash to casting our eyes into a gutter of deceit, hypocrisy and selfishness.This is not to say, however, that the media should have held back on coverage of Cummings ndash completely the reverse. Without the forensic scrutiny of journalists wersquod never know about the double standards to which the rich and powerful hold themselves and us. We can now see that the Cummings scandal isnrsquot just a moral affront, itrsquos potentially lethal too. How many people have shrugged their shoulders and said to hell with public health advice in the wake of Cummingsrsquo actions, adopting a lsquo he can do it, so can Irsquo attitude However, under the cover of such an appalling spectacle many political issues have become distorted at a time when we need clarity of vision and nowhere has that distortion played out more than in Scotland. Cummings has had a unique Caledonian Effect.Letrsquos be frank, the squalid behaviour of Cummings and Johnson has thrown a protective cloak around the the SNP government when it comes to failures over coronavirus. Cummings has unwittingly played something of a blinder for the party and its ambitions for independence.Until the Cummings scandal, most decent minds were concentrated on the SNP governmentrsquos dreadful handling of care home deaths. More than  elderly hospital patients were sent to homes prior to mandatory testing. Around half of Scotlandrsquos deaths have been in care homes.Amid the Cummings scandal, Nicola Sturgeon said she found the care home deaths ldquoheartbreaking. Shersquos a woman of decency so her emotional response is to be believed. That doesnrsquot excuse her Governmentrsquos failures, however. Yet with Cummings soaking up headlines, scrutiny of the issue shrunk. Pressure on health secretary Jeane Freeman over her mistakes weakened.We cannot simply accept such failings in Holyrood because therersquos a tawdry circus of shame in Westminster that draws attention away. You didnrsquot need a science degree to know that the elderly were most at risk. However, there was no mandatory testing for all new care home residents in Scotland until April .The Cummings scandal has overshadowed claims that the transfer of elderly patients from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Glasgow to Gartnavel led to the virus spreading like it was onboard a ldquocruise ship. Gartnavel is said to have recorded  cases and  deaths in a matter of weeks. The buck for this stops at the desk of the health secretary and the First Minister.Concerns about a possible cover-up by the Scottish Government over an early outbreak of coronavirus in Edinburgh have been eclipsed by the Cummings scandal. Lockdown came too late here ndash just as it did in England. Testing and tracing have been inadequate. Itrsquos been a catalogue of one failure after another.From the pandemicrsquos early days, there wasnrsquot that much of a substantive dference in policy between Holyrood and Westminster. Increasingly, though, Sturgeon has begun to forge Scotlandrsquos own path but itrsquos still far from successful. We arenrsquot New Zealand, thatrsquos for sure.Set against the Johnson government, anything would look good. Some % of Scots think Sturgeon has handled the crisis well. However, comparing pretty bad to bloody useless shouldnrsquot be the yardstick by which we measure what our governments do for us.The SNP are frankly lucky to have this shameless and idiotic government in London in the shape of Cummings and Johnson. But that, sadly, makes the Scottish people less lucky. The failings in Scotland arenrsquot any less meaningful just because Boris Johnson is a disaster. If Westminster was being run by a competent leader, the SNPrsquos behaviour would seem signicantly more concerning.The Cummings Effect is also shaping other parties. Some Scottish Tories finally distanced themselves from the UK leadership, with calls for Cummings to go. It simply adds to the notion that the Scottish Tories should strike out alone and leave the UK fold. It also reinforces the perception that the partyrsquos voice here is relatively meaningless.What have Scottish Labour or the Scottish LibDems done that matters throughout the Cummings scandal  Nothing. Whatrsquos the point of Scottish Labour  When it comes to Labour the only story in town is Keir Starmer ndash the great hope. Nice guy as he may be, Richard Leonard doesnrsquot cut through ndash even at a time like this, with Cummings, when a butter kne could cut throughit had the will. The Greens also need to find their voice.When it comes to independence, Cummings must have an effect on floating voters, and soft No voters. Irsquom a Yes voter, and Irsquove been increasingly disheartened in the direction of travel the independence movement has taken in recent years. The SNP base is beyond ugly, the idea of independence has intellectually stagnated, and independence itself has provided the SNP with a shield to hide bad governance behind as its voters will tolerate any failing as long as talk of independence is thrown out now and again as red meat.But even jaded Yes voters like me feel a little galvanised now by the Cummings scandal. I may be uneasy with the independence package currently on offer ndash too many unanswered questions, and the whf of populism, Scottish exceptionalism and thin-skinned nationalism ndash but compared to where Westminster is going, I know which option looks more appealing. Westminster has been a corrupt failure for generations, now itrsquos a sick, cruel joke played on the British people.This pandemic hasnrsquot been handled well or adequately by Scotland and its government. Nevertheless, even a dysal Scotland is better than whatever the hell is happening in Westminster.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A Coronavirus Business Hardship Support Grant Scheme was launched earlier this month.The grant and loans schemes were created following engagement with local business representatives.During discussions with a broad range of business sectors, requests were made for the council to establish ways to ease the immediate pressure created by poor cash flow, with the curtailing of all trade in some sectors and severely limited trade in others.The council fund is intended to supplement rather than replace national support measures # and business applicants should first explore whether they are eligible for assistance from the schemes put in place by the Scottish and UK Governments.Before seeking a loan from OIC, businesses will need to have first applied for funding from the national Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme or the Coronavirus Bounce Back Loan Schemes.Councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said: “We are very aware of the hardship many businesses are facing in these uncertain and challenging times.“I am pleased that the emergency loan scheme, as well as the hardship grant scheme, are now in place and open for applications.“Many local businesses are receiving assistance from the government support schemes – and these should be the first port of call for those affected by the economic effects of the crisis“But we know from our engagement with Orkney’s business sectors that the national schemes won’t help all businesses.“The new loan scheme offers a further option for those that have been unable to secure support where.“If your business is facing this situation I would encourage you to check online to seeit is eligible # and to get in touch with our economic development team or Business Gateway Orkneyyou are unsure or feel it doesn’t quite meet the criteria.”Standard loan terms are for a duration of up to six years, with an initial repayment holiday period of up to a year, followed by up to five years to repay the loan balance in full.

National media reports have suggested that Home Office staff cannot access paperwork held in offices due to inefficient home working procedures.Mr Carmichael said: “EU citizens make a massive positive impact in the Northern Isles and the coronavirus crisis has only made that impact clearer. The pandemic has demonstrated the vital contributions that workers from all over the world make in supporting our economy and keeping the NHS running under severe pressure.“The ongoing legal limbo for over two hundred EU citizens in the isles is unacceptable. Continued confusion and delay caused by administrative problems must be put right. Failing to do so puts people’s futures and lives clouded in uncertainty. They deserve better from a government that promised their right to remain.“This news comes in a week in which the government has seemed blind to the importance of immigrant workers in our health and social care sectors. I am glad that the Prime Minister backed down on plans to charge immigrants working in the NHS but it should never have come that far. The EU citizens will be vital in ensuring that we come out of this crisis stronger.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One person usually does two or three days in a row at one site, then switches with another operator. “I’m quite confident operating on site alone as I’ve been in the role for a number of years now, but we are well supported and there is always someone at the end of a phonewe need any help. As occasional lone workers, we also have safeguards in place to ensure our safety.“As well as allowing me more time to keep on top of college work, which I’m finding harder now there is no face to face teaching, the single person policy also means we can be more flexible right across the dferent teams on the islands.   “For example,a number of colleagues need to self-isolate, there is now extra flexibility that can be called upon to cover these roles, so it’s good there is that resilience in place.   “I feel very grateful that I’m working for Scottish Water just now. I think we’ve been very well cared for and supported throughout the coronavirus pandemic.”    Sweyn, who joined Scottish Water eight months ago, said: “It’s been a really useful learning experience being on site by myself. This summer I will begin standby duties responding to alarms at our two water treatment sites on the mainland, so I think this time spent working the sites alone will help prepare me for those additional duties.  “I’m getting on with the routine stuff as usual andanything comes up that I need help with, I know there’s always someone at the end of the phone so I’ve got no hesitation calling them in that instance.    “It’s a really good team here, really supportive, which is great. If there have to be two people on site, then we make sure that social distancing is in place. With the implementation of these measures, we’ve been successful in producing the high-quality drinking water our customers expect while maintaining the safety of our team and others.”  Ross, who spends a lot of his time out at jobs requiring more than one person in attendance, has found the new measures harder to implement in some aspects of his role. He said: “It is things like ensuring you are keeping two metres apart when you are both digging a hole # you are so conscious of it but you’re also trying to get on and do your job so it has been a challenge.   “It hasn’t been an issue at all in terms of dealing with customers because we wear our gloves and our masks and make sure that we are well away from themwe need to speak to them, but it does make the physical aspects of our job more challenging.“I’ve been with Scottish Water for around nine months and my days can look completely dferent week to week. I can be heading out in the van to fix a burst or fit a connection, or it can be dealing with a choke on the sewer response side of things. That iety is one of the things that I was looking for: you are never bored, never stuck doing nothing. There’s always something to get on with.”  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His house was so large that he could let the legislature use four rooms. He was one of the wealthiest men in the town but he was not the only successful Orcadian businessman there. About a quarter of the men who formed the first Winnipeg Board of Trade, in March , were Orcadians or the sons of Orcadians: John Inkster and his son Colin, William Drever, Robert Tait, James Clouston, William Flett and George Kennedy.Three of the Board of Trade members have had roads named after them: Bannatyne Avenue, Inkster Bouled and Tait Avenue. There are two more named after Orcadian settlers: Mowat Road after Edward Mowat from Orphir and Setter Street after Andrew Setter, or Seatter. It is no surprise that Orcadians played such a prominent part in the early le of Winnipeg because they were there right from the start: in the Red River Valley.All through the th Century Orkney men went to work for the Hudson’s Bay Company. At its peak, in ,  of the  employees were Orcadian. Most of them came home but a good number settled in the Red River Valley: the colony south of Lake Winnipeg founded by the Earl of Selkirk for Highlanders displaced by the Clearances. The HBC had granted the land on condition that their men could retire there.The colony struggled through its early years but things settled down after the union of the HBC with the North-West Company in . Shetland pioneer Issac Cowie wrote:And it was these Orkneymen, with other veterans of the fur trade…, coming in sufficient numbers to defend it, who made permanent the settlement of Red River.”…Douglas Hill, in The Opening of the Canadian West , described the birth of Winnipeg, within the Red River Settlement, when warehouses and stores were built near the HBC#s Upper Fort Garry.#The collection of ramshackle log or frame buildings, with one or two solid houses, was at first called McDermotville after its leading citizen, an Irish settler-turned-trader named Andrew McDermot, who with his son-in-law, A G B Bannatyne, erected Winnipeg#s first buildings. Soon the town#s shops were thriving, and challenging the Fort as the settlement#s focal point#In  the prairie path that had been graced with the name #Main Street# was properly surveyed, graded and furnished with one or two culverts . It was a symptom of the magnicent optimism that prevailed. Yet the optimists were justied: Winnipeg and Manitoba were on the threshold of great things.  vw, px\"  The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.

The guidance stresses the need for personal responsibility when travelling and this co-operation is vital as we work to provide a safe transport system that supports the people of Scotland.“The route map offers a path away from the current restrictions, but the virus is still with us,we move too quickly or without appropriate diligence, it could rapidly run out of control again. “The level of physical distancing required as we navigate the phases of the route map will affect the available capacity of public transport. Operators estimate capacity will be between  per cent and  per cent of normal availability even with full services resumed. “A system that previously had . million journeys per day will be signicantly constrained. So today, I am urging employers, operators and the public to embrace these changes and help us all adapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core, for the immediate future at least, flattens peak travel demand and has a strong focus on active travel.“We are looking to increase the frequency of public transport. But reducing the demand for transport is vitally important. We are urging employers to show leadership and be as flexible as possible to allow earlier or later starting and finishing times for those that have to travel to work.  “Over the coming weeks and working with our local authority partners, the transport transition plan will look to manage demand and increase availability of road space and priority for walking, cycling, wheeling and bus. “We have a real opportunity to secure a positive and lasting change, one which supports sustainable travel habits. I am therefore delighted to confirm that the ‘Spaces for People’ fund for local authorities has proven so popular that it is being increased to £ million.“We all have a personal responsibility to take steps to protect ourselves and others. It is vital that we continue to keep two metres physical distance wherever possible, wash hands regularly and maintain good cough hygiene.  “Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be dficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters. It is understood that Miss Sturgeon has been learning Madrin while Scotlandis locked upOwen Jones has denied that he supports Identity politics, woke culture and he is not a social justice warrior.CNNhires Greta Thunberg to appear on a  as an expert on Covid .Best not to bother with why UK has biggest obesity problem in Europe. Such inquiry requires social science, some sociological imagination and a grain of empathy.Much easier to blame those poor plebs who haven#t got a grip.No need to invest on ending intergenerational deprivation and increasing opportunity too.Playgrounds for schools in poorer parts of our cities Why bother.Simples Peter, integrate #Care# for young and old into the NHS. That would include a voucher towards joining a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Those who chose not to use it, be it on their heads, it is their own health and wellbeing which will suffer. Covid  is ruthless with the obese and unfit,blame and empathy are not part le and death struggle of potentially fatal illness.Ian#s suggestion does nothing to end intergenerational deprivation, aka poverty. Poverty, and other social ills, can result in obesity in ious ways.Obesity simply is not automatically a #lestyle choice#.To suggest so is to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming.Not all single parents on benefits, depending also on whatever the Foodbank might provide, can easily promote healthy lestyles for all of their children.Many are struggling with issues beyond Ian#s limited appreciation.Seven year olds don#t generally make lestyle choices. Fat cells, once over produced in response to whatever unwelcome stimulus, don#t simply disappear. They hang around calling to be filled.Not all parents have time or money to afford Shetland Recreational Trust#s offerings.They dont all have the ability to get their children to the leisure facilities.It is only #simples#you take an uncaring and simplistic approach. Ian knows this intellectually as it has been pointed out more than once. Yet he persists. Odd. A little more fellow feeling might stem his approach.All I am suggesting Peter is an attempt to control excessive eating of Junk foodswith integrating our NHH with free access to all to a gym or active participation sports club for every citizen irrespective of wealth. Just how can that be #to indulge in inflammatory victim blaming and victim shaming. #Where are you getting your figures on childhood obesity in Shetland from Ian  Surely not from the newspaper article you’ve linked below, which is from  and quotes figures for adults from  If Ian imagines free education and access to the NHS has equalled le chances this is going to be a walk in the park.If Ian imagines the Welfare State to be thriving why so many Foodbanks  On another planet does not just describe Boris and Dodgy Dom today.There are also undernourished children in Shetland and across the UK, and parents going without in order that their children can eat. Ian might be interested to research the number of food banks before the era of Conservstive austerity and see how well the number has grown since. Quite an achievement for his #thriving welfare state#. Soon unemployment numbers will be thriving too thanks to the ghastly response to Covid  fromBoris and chumsThirty thousand deaths a year is a pre-covid figure we now have obesity as a % factor in covid  deaths!!If we were talking drug deaths running a food bank would be an offence. Perhaps that is a little tongue-in-cheek but this year obesity will be a factor in about , people dying prematurely. Surely about time for gyms, fitness and participant sports organisationsto be granted by integrated into the NHS with a free or subsidised entry for all.Sorry Peter, Boris and his chums were working with Nicola and her chums on Covid  . All in harmony which must be a first!Covid  was away with the fairies, another socialist ideal.!It is mildly reassuring that Ian Tinkler has #no faith in politicians# presumably including BoJo the Clown. This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.Ray try and understand the dference between political comment and malicious point-scoring.ian seems to be using dferent measurement criteria between scotland and england and even dferent data within scottish figures. on  may he has scottish figure  but on  may it has gone up to .the lower figure is the one for deaths from positive test cases, the higher one is all deaths where covid is mentioned on death certicate.in his original calculation for england he uses positive test figuresthus for accurate comparison he should use the lower scottish figure also. this is what alan leask has done and produced an accurate comparison.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.I did read it Ian # that’s how I know it’s completely irrelevant. Now you’ve produced aarticle from ! So, just to be straight, your reasoning for easing the Coronavirus lockdown in  is a  year old newspaper article about obesity  I don’t think that’s the real reason is it now  Could it be that you’re putting your political prejudices first again  Not that it matters of course. Now even the FMs most recent slight adjustments to lockdown only allow five-mile car run to a place to exercise. That does not get a Glaswegian far from the centre of Glasgow. It just does exactly the worst thing, concentrates people together in highly populated areas. The counterargument regards spreading the virus into new areas is fallacious. Just in case our FM had not noticed, the virus has already disseminated widely and in the great outdoors of Scotland Social Distancing is a lot easier than in Glasgow or any other city.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: A good point and as always I appreciate a good dental analogy to illustrate the dference between death and survival rates. I know here we like to fight tooth and nail about such things, but it is good to see someone #filling in# the gaps here. And as for Mr. Tinkler, he certainly puts the effort in and even though we may disagree, it keeps things on here lively. He deserves a plaque.Michael Inkster, Try .Decimal point one, not  to  . Actually maths was wrong recalculation above. Simples absurdly so, evenmental arithmetic was a little rusty first time round!!Since it appears to be much more virulent and deadly than flu the future would seem to be less than rosy.In fact, depressingly gloomy and all the statistical information so diligently presented will be consignedto no more than being purely academic and capable of making not a scrap of dference.I am more intrigued into the sources of  major viruses having a global impact from China, and what is the Chinese Government doing about the health and safety of food products and the, apparent, lack of any proper procedures in which to prevent further outbreaks  What is the WHO doing in regards to monitoring potential infections from China and or limiting the movements of live animals in poorly developed hygiene conditions, allegedly We hear the origins of such viruses, but no information regarding preventative measures taking place to restrict and confine such health hazards within an area and to stop this from spreading further afield  Why has there been no ban on the sale and transport of certain foods from China Is the whole process of live animal meat production having to be totally reviewed by the Chinese government or is it a case of waiting until something even greater forces them to act Should we enforce our own standards of Health and Safety onto other countries in terms of a trade agreement or should market forces have a free for all without any restrictions, including Health and Safety  Should this be reviewed JOSEPH NIVEN has hit the nail squarely on the head. The statistics are not clearly put and blaming one UK politician, BoJo or Sturgeon is wrong. The SNP and Torie parties pretty much followed identical policies until last week.If Ian imagines free education has eliminated inequalities of opportunity he is mistaken.inequalities of opportunity frequently come down to ambition. The opportunities are there for all, not everybody wishes to take them.Sure good sound parentage and background help promote ambition, but the old adage you can take a horse to water but!!! If you wish to destroy ambition, try extreme socialism. The good old USSR and present-day Venezuela give good examples.I don#t know where to start with this statement Ian, and I#m not sure it will make any dference to youI do.There are multiple stories on just this very subject, but since you are not a big fan of the arts, you might not have read them, seen them or heard them.You can have ambition, and even a great education, but still be knocked back by the old boy network, or because you are not white or not male. These inequalities still exist.There are statistics to show that Eton boys get the top jobs still, and the only way to get a better leader for this country will be to do away with privilege and try to level the playing field. New Zealand for example have a great leader and it is refreshing to see someone lead who has her role on merit.I know nothing of the countries you mention but I am sure they still have ambitious and educated people despite your partisan viewpoint.Well it’s a surprise to see that the Scottish government aren’t being blamed for poverty and suffering this time # turns out it was the underprivileged’s own fault all along. I’m sure a sharp word will snap them out of it and everyone will be a CEO or a government advisor in no time. Just need to put the effort in old boy what what! I’d always thought the morally bereft who profit from misery and desperation who have a lot to do with keeping the poor poor have a lot to answer for though you know payday lenders, gambling companies, private dentists with a monopoly#Ian might as well say the poor are frequently to blame for their lot. Oil rich Norway does not tolerate UK levels of inequality.Neither do many other poprer countries.Quite what the USSR and Venesuala have got to do with it is likely apparent to Ian.Others will see their inclusion within what passes for his argument as a clear attempt at distraction. The possible impacts of being brought up in poverty by others who have had the same dficulties are many.The opportunities for such children are not easily compared to, say, those enjoyed by the young Boris Johnson.Ian is again indulging himself in victim blaming.UK policy has not set out to create level playing fields for socio-econmic participation. It should, but won#t for as long as #One Nation# English Conservatives like Boris Johnson continue to serve the interests of those of Ian Tinkler#s outlook over those of all. On th of May Ian described intergenerational deprivation as #relevant to Victorian times#.NY pretending ambition alone can help all children born into poverty to escape it Ian is demonstrating Victorian attitudes of his own. Seven year olds brought up in bedsits should choose better parental lestyles.I was unaware Thatcher, Blair, Cummings, Callahan, Wilson et all went to Eton. Mind you, Tony Ben, Sir Antony no less went to Westminster college!!!! Quite what that has to do #With the price of tea in China # rather like your former comments, escapes me!Johan, Ian#s not just a contrarian, compelled to rile others, but does so to share his quite unpleasant world-view. He talks of intergenerational deprivation as being a #very trendy left-wing academic hypothesis, relevant to Victorian times# but it#s a known fact that many a bairn raised in poverty, enjoying few opportinities will go on to live in poverty and have few opportunities. If they become parents, the likelihood of their bairns being able to do better lessens generation by generation without purposeful government action designed to level the playing field.The concept used here is social mobility and many governments globally take pains to increase it. Where those with disadvantageous starts in le go on, on average, to do better than their parents,social mobility is high. Where their lot is likely to be fixed at birth social mobility is low. Scotland has a long running research project to monitor it. In addition to the factors you cite, cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence as well as other non-lestyle factors. Ian knows obesity can have complex causes, but doesn#t care. Its quite tragic.Poor parenting is really not a class thing whatever are trendy humanist academics may say. Just feeble attempts to justy socialist ideals. However, that has nothing to do with my attempt to deal with excess fat and obesity., #cards can also firmly stacked against children raised by semi-literate, or drug-dependent parents, or in situations of domestic violence or sexual violence. # Well apart from the semi-literate bit that sounds a little bit like an Etonian upbringing, so typical of the Aristocracy!!! I love the bit about #Scotland has a long-running research project to monitor it.# .What a shame it is run by a load of left-wing academics, perhaps that is why Scotland#s performance falls so far short of England#s with regard to social mobility!! As for the complex causes of obesity, it is really simple Peter, it is not even class-related. It is simply eating more than food than your body needs. Whatever socio-psychological hogwash you may spout, in the final analysis, comes down to eating too much.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

August date is a week earlier than previously scheduled for the - Highland school term.Early Learning and childcare settings will open over the summer, while teachers – currently delivering lessons from home – will from June be allowed into schools to prepare and plan for the new way of working and welcoming pupils back.While the school gates will open again, parents have been told to expect a mix of classroom and home learning to continue.The agreement reached between councils, professional associations and parent representatives means:Skye councillor John Finlayson, who chairs Highland Council’s education committee, said Mr Swinney’s announcement was broadly in line with the expectations of the authority’s education recovery group.However, he said he was pleased that local authorities would be given flexibility in their approach.He said: “Clearly the challenges each authority faces will be signicantly dferent and within Highland itself we will have dferent challenges in urban and rural areas.“Local authorities have been given the flexibility to plan and deliver ato education in a manner that suits local circumstances and the council’s education improvement team, supported by other officers, in consultationwith school leaders and school staff, will look to implement approaches that enable pupils to get back to school.“A blended approach to learning will continue for a while yet. Whatever is implemented will put the wellbeing of our children at its heart.”Schools closed on th March and since then pupils have been learning at home, through lessons delivered online by teachers.Other pledges made by Mr Swinney included one to expand the school estate, using libraries, community halls, leisure centres, conference venues or taking short-term leases of vacant business accommodation to increase the time children can spend with their teachers.He also suggested that retired teachers couldto school as part of plans to limit class sizes.To support digital home learning, the Scottish Government is to invest £ million for , laptops or tablets – with internet access provided – for disadvantaged childrenMr Swinney added “This is not, however, ato schooling as we knew it # schools are not ing to normal at this stage.“To keep our pupils and staff safe we will implement physical distancing, staggered arrival and departure times, staggered break times, increased hand hygiene, enhanced cleaning regimes and a range of other measures.“That means a new model of teaching, learning and support will have to be delivered. Precise details will y from school to school but for the vast majority, classes are going to be much smaller to allow physical distancing and, as a result, children are likely to spend about half their time learning at home.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cummings-1.jpg","title":"s e am beul a labhras ach an gniomh a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTha fhios’am gun can cuid gu bheil an dol a-mach aig Dominic Cummings agus aig an fhear a tha os a chionnBoris MacIain dìreach ceangailte ri ‘Bolgan Beag Westminster’ mar a chanas iad, ach tha e fada nas farsainge agus nas doimhne agus nas cudromaiche agus nas cunnartaiche na sin.Oir tha na daoine sin, latha as deoghaidh latha, a’ togail fianais gu bheil aon lagh ann airson uaisleanna dùthcha seo, agus lagh eile ann dha na daoine cumanta – dhutsa agus dhòmhsa.A bharrachd air mar a bha daoine faireachdainn nuair a rinn an Riaghaltasionnsaigh air Iraq air sàilean Seòras Bush, chan fhaca mise daoine cumanta cho crosta agus cho cridhe-briseach agus a tha iad air a bhith le mar a tha An Cuimeanach agus MacIain agus na pupaidean eile anns A’ Chaibineat gan giùlain fhèin.Agus san giùlain sin air mullach, agus ceangailte ris, an droch-làimsheachaidh a tha air a dhèanamh air an galair Covid  le na mìltean mòra nise air air am beatha chall.Tha e doirbh a thuigsinn a bheil na daoine a tha gar riaghladh mar sin a dh’aona-ghnothach, no tro aineolas agus fèinealachd.An dara fear dhiubh sin, saoilidh mi.

The move is vital to secure a stronger future for the business which is urging politicians to support its drive to produce , hydrogen buses in the next four years.The  staff that remain would be more than a ten-fold increase in the number of employees inherited by the management team when it bought Wrightbus out of administration in October , with hopes to grow the workforce to , by the end of .“When we saved Wrightbus from administration last year, there were only about  employees, and since then we have grown the workforce to ,” said Mr Atwal.“The decision has been taken to trim the workforce to the size we believe we will need to see us through to the end of the year.”The redundancies are a necessary measure given the economic slowdown as a result of the current Coronavirus crisis. However, it has not altered the long-term vision of prosperity for the company.“Throughout the COVID- pandemic, while we furloughed a large section of the workforce, we also kept about  engineers, designers and sales staff working to make sure we can take future orders of buses and work on long-term projects, which will provide security and stability for Wrightbus in the coming years,” said Mr Atwal.The Wrightbus factory has created the world’s first hydrogen-electric double-decker bus, which emits only water and there is a great belief that in the coming years this will see a large number of orders come in.There are already strong sales for the delivery of buses in London and Aberdeen this year, with more cities due to follow suit.Mr Atwal said: “We see the future in zero-emission hydrogen and battery-electric transport and have positioned the business accordingly. Our vision is to have , people working for us by the end of  and we hope to be in a position to re-hire some of those who have been made redundant.“We believe green fuel is the future and will bring a brighter future to Northern Ireland over the coming years.”A consultation will begin with staff on Monday, May , and Wrightbus will be supporting staff throughout the process, eventhis has to be done virtually due to current Government guidelines.

The announcement by management is therefore profoundly regrettable.“Management plans to make redundant  employees and to bring forward a phased-process of reducing agency staffing affecting up to  workers. Every job lost is a heavy blow for the inidual concerned, their household, the wider community and economy – especially in the face of the current Covid- pandemic.“Ahead of this announcement being made, I spoke to senior management to call on them to utilise the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme to protect jobs and retain skilled workers the prospect of workers being thrown onto the dole queues at this time is unacceptable.“Management confirmed they will be proceeding to a -day consultative period on their proposals but that they will consider furlough as an option. They sought to reassure us of their ambitions for Wrightbus in Ballymena and its centrality to their plans.“Instead of reducing employment, we need to ramp up production of hydrogen-buses to curb greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a more environmentally-sustainable economy. “The Wrightbus workforce is perfectly positioned to make a vital contribution to that they have the skills to build the buses at the heart of any future green transport policy.“The request for furlough will be top of Unite’s agenda in the consultation process.

Having grown up in the era when the river was dominated by the huge red brick edice of the Braidwater Mill, Rodney points out that its path is more exposed to public view than ever. “When you look back, it was pretty much enclosed space from McNinch Footbridge to Harryville Bridge.  “People had no reason to be in that area unless they were mill workers.“Nowadays we have great views right along this section and I personally feel that there has to be a joined up approach to making full use of this fantastic potential.“With the opening of the retail park it has now opened the area up to everyone and the nature and beauty around the river with wildle such as swans, ducks, otters, kingfishers and other wildle regularly seen on the stretch from Sainsbury’s down to Harryville bridge,” he said. But he acknowledges that not not everyone will see the beauty associated with the area. “There will always be some who will still treat it as a dumping ground and continue to put the wildle and the environment at risk by dumping their refuse into the river. “These people need to be told in no uncertain terms that this will not be lolerated by the local community - we have the ability to impose fines on those who continually flaunt regulations and I would call for such monetary penalties to be used more frequently.”But Rodney beleives the real driving force behind the naural rejuvenation of the area must comes as a united push.“ I feel that the authorities responsible for this area and the retail park owner have to take seriously the issues associated with this stretch of water and listen to the concerns of the community groups and members of the public who regularly use the pathways around the river for daily exercise.“My opinion is that things weren’t thought through properly at the outset and the environmental issues weren’t taken into account when the retail park was being planned. “The aim now should be to preserve the beauty of this stretch of the river Braid and that means taking steps to make sure this happens.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3138061.jpg--.jpg?1590480464000\n","title":"opinion moral necessity to support local business in post virus world","story":"By the Very Rev Dr Norman Hamilton OBEThese last weeks have seen contrasting trends as we battle with coronavirus.

Will community spirit be relegated to the back benches by the need for so many of us to rebuild the patterns of our own everyday lives  And crucially, will we have become so content with buying on-line and having the parcel delivered to our front door, that we will be less committed to buying locally, and supporting local business  I must confess to having real fears on both questions. When the focus moves away from carers and the NHS, what community need will fill the gap  It is very dficult to think of an example which affects every one of us, and to which we can bring such loyalty. And will the obvious convenience of having that parcel delivered to our front door be set aside to go shopping locally on a cold November morning or a wet February afternoon Personally I feel that it is a moral necessity to support our local businesses and shops as best we can – evenit costs a little more to do so. They of course will be well aware of the threat from the big international companies, and must play their part in quality of service and show the ‘personal touch’ that will make it attractive to do business with them in its own right. And there would be a great added bonus that such support on an ongoing basis would be a quite new and important expression of community spirit.I have absolutely no dficulty with the owner of Amazon seeing new opportunities to expand his business. But I have real dficultyordinary citizens like myself in our local area see it as acceptable to give his company so much of our limited income that many of the businesses in our neighbourhood go into serious decline. The Biblical command to ‘love your neighbour as yourself’ has a new and crucially important relevance.

There will be thousands of job losses, he said.I#ll be proposing that a task force is set up to focus on how best we get the city back up and running. I#d like to see a memorial built to all those who have lost their lives from Covid-.In an exclusive interview with the Belfast , the next Lord Mayor talked about being the first single dad in the job.The SDLP is set to nominate its poll-topping Ardoyne councillor, Paul McCusker, as Deputy Lord Mayor. A nurse in the Mater Hospital, he is a community activist known for his work with the homeless.Covid- will make Monday#s mayoral installation ceremony very dferent from those in previous years. Social distancing means there can#t be a full meeting of all  councillors. Instead, each party will nominate a small number of representatives to attend.The practice of the outgoing Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor placing the chain of office around the shoulders of their successors will be suspended.Mr McCoubrey succeeds Sinn Fein#s Danny Baker and Mr McCusker takes over from Alliance#s Peter McReynolds.The next Lord Mayor hopes that, despite the restrictions, his mother and five children can watch proceedings from the public gallery in City Hall.Mr McCoubrey will also not have the crowded diary of public engagements that usually awaits new Lord Mayors. It#s very frustrating, he said. Once restrictions ease, I want to be out thanking our NHS and care workers, and those who have been delivering food parcels to the old and vulnerable.Mr McCoubrey, who has been a councillor for  years, said his working-class roots would be to the fore during his mayoralty.I grew up in Springmartin and I still live there. We had nothing. We were no dferent from the people in Springhill across the peace line. I#m a proud unionist but I want to be a Lord Mayor for the people of Springmartin, Springhill and all in this city, whatever their politics.Asked about his attitude to gay marriage, which his party opposes, he said: Same-sex marriage is legal here, and I#ve always taken the approach of live and let live. As Lord Mayor I want everyone to feel welcome in this city regardless of race, religion or sexual orientation.Mr McCoubrey was first elected as a councillor for the Ulster Democratic Party , the UDA#s political wing. He joined the DUP in . When I walked into City Hall in , I was totally overwhelmed. I was the youngest councillor there and the sole UDP one. I went in as a super-Prod from the Shankill, determined to fly the flag high. I#ve learned a lot over the years.In those early days Sinn Fein councillors Fra McCann and Tom Hartley would sit down for a chat. They represented areas with the same problems as mine. Sinn Fein members in City Hall fought tooth and nail for everything they#ve achieved for their communities. Nothing was given to them. I decided to do the same for mine, evenit meant being a thorn in the side of the council establishment.Mr McCoubrey said he#d joined the UDP because the mainstream unionist parties felt remote to someone from my class. He said: I knew it was the political wing of a paramilitary organisation but it was trying to bring peace and stability to the community, and I was up for that.Askedhe was a UDA member andhe condemns its terror campaign, he said: I was never in the UDA. I condemn every murder in Northern Ireland. They were all wrong. None were, or can, be justied.Mr McCoubrey#s term of office as deputy mayor in  was marred when he shared a  with UDA members Johnny Adair and Michael Stone at a loyalist culture day event on the Shankill, which ended with masked men firing shots in the air. He said: Had I known what would happen, I#d not have been on that stage. Things spiralled out of control and I was caught in the middle of it.I remember at the next council meeting, the Sinn Fein group leader got up and said, #I#ve no doubt the deputy lord mayor is a reasonable person but...# and I was bombarded with criticism. Every nationalist councillor wanted me removed.I continued in office but it left a very sour taste for the Catholic community. Had I been able to turn the clock back, I#d have done it in a heartbeat.Mr McCoubreygrew up the eldest in a family of four in Springmartin. His mother was a guide helping on buses taking disabled children to school in west Belfast. His father, who was a fitter in Belfast Gasworks, fell to his death from a roof when Mr McCoubrey was .A lot of responsibility landed on my shoulders, he said. I had just started working as a painter and decorator and I did as much overtime as I could get to help pay the bills. My mum took a second job in the Royal Victoria Hospital laundry as well. Times were tough.Mr McCoubrey has three grown-up children from his first marriage. He has brought up his two sons, Frankand Kyle , as a single dad since his second marriage broke up over a decade ago. It was a steep learning curve for me but I#ve now perfected my cooking, cleaning and ironing skills, he joked.Some times of the year were hard - putting the boys to bed on Christmas Eve and knowing they wouldn#t have two parents there in the morning like most other kids. But summers were always great. I#d a caravan in Portrush and we#d head down there for weekends of fishing, walking on the beach, and Barry#s.The boys are my best friends. I was offered the Lord Mayor#s position four years ago but didn#t take it because they were too young.They don#t need me just as much now. They#re so excited about me becoming Lord Mayor. It#s been a battle getting them to keep it a secret and not tell their mates.Last September, Frank Jnr was the victim of a sectarian hate crime when he was beaten up by nationalist youths as he walked home from school.I was cooking dinner and he walked in, bleeding, bruised and shaking. His jaw was broken. I was devastated. I#ve brought both my boys up to not care about somebody#s religion and I didn#t want this to change them.That night, Arlene [Foster] visited us. She sat with Frank and told him that he must rise above the assault and not let it poison his mind.Mr McCoubrey said the attack had knocked the stuffing out of his son. He played football for Berlin Swts but he hasn#t been back since, and he#s in counselling. But we got phone calls and #get well# cards from right across the community, including from Sinn Fein people, and that was a big help. I want to build on that cross-community spirit as Lord Mayor.

This has been an unprecedented time when faithful Catholics have been unable to receive the Eucharist for months.While many churches have been availing of streaming services via webcams and social media over recent weeks, it#s not the same as being present for Mass.I have a lot of anxious parents whose children haven#t yet been baptised so as soon as it is safe we should be doing that.Fr McCafferty added: Clergy will adapt to the current danger and make things as safe as possible. Older people may be disappointed at not being able toimmediately but we have to consider their safety. The draft plan also envisages confirmation ceremonies taking place in mid-September but advises that such celebrations would be conducted by the parish priest and may have to take place in small groups over successive days.The plan aims to ensure that all preparations are made so that churches are ready to move once the civil authorities in both Northern Ireland and the Republic give approval.Government sources in Dublin have hinted that phase four of its roadmap - when public Masses are due to begin from July  - could be brought forward to the end of Junethe virus continues to be successfully managed.The -point programme, which is expected to be boiled down to key issues in the coming days, also bans choirs and congregational singing when churches re-open.It suggested that dioceses prepare short videos similar to aircraft safety demonstrations to assist parishioners in correct behaviour when ing to Mass.The document says: It is clear that re-opening the pastoral le of the Church will be far more challenging institutionally than anything we have been through in the past few months. Our biggest challenge may be lack of motivation to do all that is required on the part of some, and unbridled enthusiasm to do everything on the part of others.It needs to be clearly understood, however, that churches will only be able to re-open for public liturgy when the proper procedures have been put in place.Earlier this week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said it was sad and disappointing that the Covid- restrictions have lasted throughout the Easter season and congregations are still unable to gather physically.Belfast Most ReadNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reported#It#s a disaster ... no way I would cycle next to heavy traffic with no safety barrier# - Cyclists criticise Sydenham Bypass resurfacingBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffe,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Paul StaffordThere#s no doubt the salon is going to look and feel dferent. It will be a completely new experience, said Mr Stafford.What people probably don#t fully appreciate until now is the fact that hairdressing is not a service, it#s an experience and there#s a social connection there, a bond and friendships, and some of that might be lost when we reopen. He believes masks, gloves, a reduced menu and longer opening hours will all be part of our new normal.According to the National Hair and Beauty Federation, there are some , hairdressing salons here employing around , staff and generating around £m annually. This does not include self-employed mobile stylists.Our industry in Northern Ireland is up there with the best in world. I#m very proud with the levels of artistry here and what we need now is the whole industry to come together and make sure that we follow the right procedures and aren#t left threatened by people who challenge our businesses by doing things illegally, added Mr Stafford.We are quite efficient and work on a tight schedule but under new guidelines there will be literally no waiting time. It will be a case of making sure clients come in on time and are taken straight through, using an efficient system.At the outset we, personally, will be expanding hours, swapping our normal eight-hour day to  or  hours with staff working shts. That could see us opening from .am and closing at pm.We have a -seater salon and we will be reducing that to four compartments with visors and enough space between.Read More Belfast#s Crossen Engineering sees demand surge for new PPE visorPreparing for such scenarios at beauty-based salons here is manufacturer Crossen Engineering, which is already making visors for the NHS.It is starting to increase its lines to accommodate hair and beauty businesses in the run-up to reopening.We are beginning to see other industries order visors for when they reopen. Places like hospitality establishments, hairdressers and beauty salons, said managing director Paul Crossen.This is all hypothetical and all we can do is plan for every scenario, Mr Stafford is quick to point out.It#s not as simple as ticking all the boxes, this has to be put into practice and it could be a case that it#s just not working, it#s not efficient and that will be problematic.I have spoken to friends in Italy and Germany where there are restrictions and guidelines, but no one is monitoring them. The worst thing that could happen is another spike in October, so I would advise clients now to sit tight. Hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there. Paul StaffordYes, your hair might look bad and I#ll tell youit looks bad, but stick a hat on, put your hair up, go for a walk and wait until it#s ready. To keep his clients# spirits up during lockdown, Mr Stafford has created a series of #The Virtual Chair# chats with local personalities on his Instagram page.It#s me having conversations with people like Colin Davidson, author Oliver Jeffers, musician Mickey Bradley from The Undertones and broadcaster Pamela Ballantine, he explained. They#re typical of the conversations we would haveI was cutting their hair, and that has brought a great community back together. We#ve had a bit of fun and it shows people that this is what they#re missing. It keeps the brand out there and lets our customers know we are there for them and we#re getting more and more people tuning in.We understand that hair is very important but there is a bigger issue out there this virus is killing people and there have been around  needless deaths here. At our salon no one has been left untouched by it, but we should come through this pandemic in a way that shows empathy.We have been indirectly impacted at the salon and we would like to do this in a respectful way that is safe for everyone.

It#s a  Mustang, and Ireland and Ulster winger Jacob Stockdale couldn#t be happier working on his classic car, with its blue bodywork and two go-faster stripes down its back.The -year-old professional rugby player bought the car on eBay a year ago and the last two months of lockdown in Belfast has given him the luxury of time to pull on his mechanic#s overalls and explore the iconic #first gen# Mustang.Jacob won#t reveal how much he paid for the car which came off the Ford assembly line two years after the first Mustang debuted.It probably was not one of my wisest purchases, but I bought it as a bit of a project car, something to do a bit of work to as a hobby and I love it, said the Lurgan native.Going into lockdown has given me time to tinker away on the car, and I#ve done quite a bit of work on it. I#ve replaced the entire suspension.I re-wired a few things like the horn and the radio because they were both draining the battery.And a year after arriving in Belfast from London, the car still hasn#t a name.No, funnily enough I haven#t given it a name. Nothing comes to mind yet, said Jacob.In terms of its shape, it is my favourite style of Mustang. They ran from  to # or #, so I wanted one from that range.The engine is . litres, so it#s hardly a green machine. It#s quite thirsty, put it that way, said Jacob.And what about speed  Jacob Stockdale is certainly no slouch on the field of play.The GPS which players wear on the back of their jerseys records their speed, travel distance and other stats.I think the fastest I#ve ever been clocked moving is . metres per second, which is around  miles per hour or something like that, said Jacob.He name checks the Mustang Fastbacks, famous for their speed, but Jacob is self-deprecating about his motor. I would say mine is more loud and slow.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJacob Stockdale is happy to have the time to work on his carAnd while he loves the loud sound of the Mustang, his Hungarian Vizsla dog, Layla, isn#t so keen.Purist tendencies means Jacob tries to keep the car looking like it did when it came out of the factory and while his new radio looks old, it has Bluetooth. Just the thing to listen to Johnny Cash, one of his musical favourites, in the car Not so, it seems. He prefers to listen to the sound of the car. Jacob#s first car back in  was his mother#s old  Corsa and his road car is an Audi RS .Yesterday, Jacob took time to promote the Phone a Friend campaign from the mental health charity Aware, which urgently needs to raise funds. Demands on their services are high due to the Covid- pandemic. The campaign is being fronted by Jacob, who is a brand ambassador for Maxol, Aware#s charity partner and runs until June .Jacob said: I had my girlfriend around during lockdown, but I have friends who had to isolate by themselves for  weeks and it can be a struggle and a dficult time, especiallyyou are living with depression or any mental illness.

I wanted to take the pressure off them and do something for the whole denomination, providing some normality perhaps, he said.Uppermost in my mind also was the sense of identity, of being a Presbyterian family who could not meet together. I wanted to give expression to that in the midst of everything.He added: We have all been affected by the pandemic, and my heart goes out to those who have lost loved ones across our island and those who have battled against the virus. They have been in my thoughts and prayers, just as those who continue to go that extra mile in providing daily care for them in our hospitals and care homes. It has been incredible and as a church we thank God for their selfless service and sacrice.The Rev Henry last preached to a church congregation on March . I have been askedI feel that I have been #locked-out# because of the Covid- emergency, he said.We have all had to make adjustments and to live with changed times. As a Moderator your diary is full, you know exactly what you are doing and then suddenly  weeks or more are wiped. However just as in the months before the lockdown, I have been busy and in some ways even busier, but in a dferent way. I have done  weekly pre-recorded services, with the last one going out on Sunday.He admitted that his year in the post had pushed me out of my comfort zone. I am naturally quite shy and reserved and that is not who a Moderator is. You have to get out there, speak up and do the things you are called to do, he said.He said that since the lockdown the Irish church leaders have met more frequently, through video-conferencing, nearly every two weeks. He has already taken part in online meetings with the First and Deputy First Ministers, UK church leaders and the Taioseach. The Moderator#s outgoing address will be streamed live on Monday night during the installation service for the new Moderator, Rev David Bruce.Belfast Most ReadNI death rate similar to Republic#s, not % higher, claims leading economistCoronavirus: Northern Ireland shoppers warned a world of change is on the way after lockdownCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Infrastructure Minister Mallon calls for Cummings to resign after two Covid- deaths reportedBBC Radio Ulster#s Nuala McKeever #saying nothing# after Dominic Cummings on-air gaffe#It#s a disaster ... no way I would cycle next to heavy traffic with no safety barrier# - Cyclists criticise Sydenham Bypass resurfacing,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The former Ballinderry Chairman is Ulster GAAs Head of Operations, but has been called onto the GAAs Covid- Advisory Group, chaired by Chairman of Health and Safety group Shay Bannon. “Our work is less than two weeks old,” McGeehan told the County Derry Post, of the group that reports directly to President John Horan and Director General Tom Ryan. “We are there to provide advice and make recommendations. In terms of the decisions, they will be made by the GAAs management committee. googletag.cmd.push “Our remit is a short and sharp piece of work to develop protocols of how and on what basis,it is possible, will it be possible toto training, playing and eventually watching games again.” Professor Mary Horgan, a professor in infectious diseases, has been added to the group. She has previously been advising other world governing bodies of sport. “Her role is crucial in helping voluntary bodies like the GAA,” McGeehan feels. “All of this needs to be medically driven, whether is it is public health advice from the governments or the research around the vaccines and all that might be required in the future.” googletag.cmd.push The committee have, as McGeehan terms it, the easy job, with GAA management having the final call. An initial plan of inter-county action in October and club pencilled in for mid-July, was based on a cut back version. Footballs Tier  championship, the Super s and the qualiers were likely to be shelved, as were the group stages in the hurling championship. In terms of Derry, the senior hurlers had qualied for the NHL promotion play-off. It was initially hoped that games involving relegation and promotion couldve been pencilled into the overall plan, in a bid to provide a clean slate for . “There is no play-book to this and I dont think anyone knowsany of the league games could be played,” was McGeehans opinion on the situation. “At the minute, the focus is on whether activity willat all and what it would require to bring that activity back. No formal decision has been made on the league or the championship.” He also has sympathy for Antrim and Armagh footballers who worked themselves into promising league positions. “That decision will be taken very carefully and on the basis of what space there is. As the weeks go on, I think it becomes less likely that there will be room for them, but I wouldnt rule them out completely.” In terms of club activity, counties have been working away to come up with plans that could be activated once there is a green light. It is likely that club leagues will be scrapped with,there is any action, a series of warm-up games ahead of a knock-out championship. “It would be very important for a lead-in period,” McGeehan feels. “You would want to give club players time to get collective training under their belt, to get them out. Given the timescale, there mightnt be room for many league games. “The window is a moving piste, in that the GAA talked about October and November . In theory, the inter-county programme,bumped into December and into January would allow the clubs a bit more time.” For McGeehan, getting clubs – who he heaped praise onto for their efforts in communities- up and running first is a must. IDEAL “An ideal situation for me would be to get guidance and clarity, to get started back with club football and hurling getting a sizeable window before the inter-county starts back. “Everybody is mad to get out, but only when it is safe to do so. From a safety point of view, it is not about risk elimination, it is about risk reduction.” If the pandemic continues, it could force long term change. In McGeehans opinion, any measures put in place by the GAA may continue into  and beyond. “I think club activity ing is hugely important,” he feels, not just for sporting reasons, There is a a growing epidemic of mental health issues. There are issues over social isolation. I think the first resumption of activity needs to happen at a local level,that is possible.” McGeehan points out the change of language by the government. “Terms such as permanent pandemic surveillance, that type of vocabulary. We are going to have to adjust our lives for Covid- or other strains of a disease like this for the foreseeable. “While it is important to keep peoples thoughts positive, that there might be Gaelic games in , the measure you put in place might carry on into next year and the year after.” The second issue, he feels is becoming clear relates to youths, tied in with theirto school. He asks: “Is there a way, after risk assessments, that you are able to get juvenile activity moving and you are able to get kids out on the pitch again ” “If that is an area of less-risk for the spread of the disease and children have been less affected by it, that presents an opportunity to get them out whenever there is the science to be able to do that.” From the point of view of testing, McGeehan – while pointing out that inter-county players are deemed elite – the GAA is dferent to the Premier League, or indeed the Bundesliga that has two rounds complete since their resumption. “We are dferent,” he begins. “We are neither professional nor semi-professional. From that perspective, the GAA have to look at things dferently. “We have an inter-county game that, like the professional leagues, in theory could work,it was peoples full-time job to be Gaelic footballers or hurlers, but it is not their full-time job.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill announced that the Magee Medical School had been agreed and that students would start next September. Days later Economy Minister Diane Dodds said signicant work is required and questioned Ulster Universitys financial stability. She added that further reports would be submitted to the Executive. Seeking clarity on the matter, Sinead McLaughlin said: “I have today submitted a written question asking health minister Robin Swannhe will publish his department’s own internal business case for the Magee Medical School. We need greater transparency. googletag.cmd.push “While I very strongly welcome the progress made recently with regard to the Magee Medical School, we also have to impose sunlight on the process to learn where the blockages are. It is very important that we keep the pressure on to ensure the Magee Medical School opens in September . “I emphasised this in my speech in the Northern Ireland Assembly this evening, in which I complained about the lack of transparency over the progress on the Medical School and compared this to the confusion over the plans for Northern Ireland after the end of the Brexit transition period.” In part of that speech, she said: “I met – virtually of course – yesterday with senior representatives of Ulster University. I left the meeting with the sense that they were as in the dark about what happens now regarding progressing the business case for the Medical School as we in Northern Ireland are about the new customs arrangements after Brexit. googletag.cmd.push “We need to know what is going on. We need greater transparency. That applies to the British government’s plans for Brexit, and also to the plans of our own government – the Executive and its senior officials – when it comes to the Magee Medical School.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last week Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that a Medical School at Magee had been agreed by the Executive with an anticipated September  opening. However, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood amongst others sought further detail saying student intake next year was ‘far from certain’. Speaking at a Stormont debate on the Budget Bill this week, DUP MLA Mervyn Storey - a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board - challenged the way finances have been distributed. googletag.cmd.push To fulfil the commitment made to police officers in the New Decade, New Approach document would cost poundm per year, he said, which the finance minister has available. He continued: “There are those who would like the Police Service of Northern Ireland to be run into the ground and be so constrained that would be incapable of dealing with public order and the many challenges that it faces.” The North Antrim MLA and former finance minister said poundm was allocated to the new medical facility in Derry. “When anyone looks at the current estimates for the running - the capital and the resource - of that project, the cost will be in excess of pound million. googletag.cmd.push “Some people are hanging their hats on the City Deal providing the additional money, but there is no doubt that it will have recurring costs that have to come back to the Executive,” he added. Ulster University previously told the Derry News that when fully operational with  students per year the medical school will cost approximately poundm per year. Mr Storey went on to say that a ‘deal is a deal’ and in the New Decade, New Approach document there is an agreement to fund a medical school, and, on the opposite page, a commitment to increase police numbers to ,. It leads to the question, he said, what was the process to remove the medical school from the Department for the Economy and the Department of Health and move it to the Executive Office  “Why did that happen, given the fact that responsibility for the delivery of that project lay primarily in those two departments ” TIME RESTRAINTS In responseSinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy said: “First, in relation to the PSNI bid and the members view that it was part of a deal. “If it was part of a deal, it is not the responsibility of the Finance Minister to go in and demand that the Justice Minister brings forward a proposition. There is a party leaders forum, which, I think, was set up as a consequence of NDNA in order to discuss issues that might be outside the day-to-day workings of Departments. “If there is an argument that that commitment is not being met, I suggest to the member that that is the area in which to raise it and, hopefully, then secure an agreement. I am more than happy to play my part in that.” With regard to the Magee campus and Ulster University situation, the finance minister said there was a ‘time pressure on agreements’ that needed to be made about matched funding of the inclusive future fund and also about the intake for the graduate-entry medical school. “There was a lack of agreement between both departments on which one would have lead responsibility for that.” He concluded: “In those circumstances, correctly, the Executive Office and the offices of the First Minister and deputy First Minister stepped in to try to arbitrate and find a way through that. “That is how it ended up in that department.” DERRY REPRESENTATIVES During the sitting, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said she met with senior representatives of Ulster University and left the meeting with the sense that they were in the dark about what happens now in terms of progressing the business case for the medical school. “We need to know what is going on. We need more detail, and we need greater transparency. That applies to the British Governments plan for Brexit, but it also applies to the plans of our Government, the Executive Office and senior officials when it comes to the Magee medical school. “The medical school is due to open its doors in September . “Like every other elected representative and everybody in the city, I was delighted by the announcement, but a lot of work needs to be done for that to take place. It needs to be done very quickly, with a sense of urgency, and I urge the joint First Ministers to proceed at pace.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Karen Mullan commented: “You have two Derry representatives speaking one after another. “Not only are we obviously very passionate about where we come from but we are passionate about delivering the projects that have been worked on for many years. “The recent announcement of match funding for the Derry City and Strabane strategic growth plan and inclusive future fund, alongside the Executive commitment to open the medical school at Magee, are examples of what can and should be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has selected a team of players he would go to war with in the white heat of championship... What God has put together, let no man put asunder’. There is a reason for not having any of the dogs of war in this team, those who fought with me in the trenches to conquer All-Ireland club glory in  - I can’t or won’t pull that team apart. The one thing from my days of football and hurling at all levels that stands out, is that I really enjoyed the thrill of competing and playing. The players here were all part of the enjoyment factor at ious stages of my career. googletag.cmd.push I count myself very lucky to be a part of some special teams at school, university, club, county and province. There are many lads unfortunate not be in this team. Particularly those who reached the summits of  with me. All of the boys who started that day and made a contribution throughout that year deserve massive recognition. On beer rating and craic alone Fergal ‘Rooster’would walk onto any team. McGilligan, Barton, Burns, Quinn, Coleman, Heaney and Cassidy would walk onto any county team. Gary Doyle, who wasn’t part of the  team, was a superb player for Lavey for many years. googletag.cmd.push You don’t win anything without great players and particularly great characters as well.Management will always be a massive factor in your development and success. Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer. I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well.

He has selected a team of players he would go to war with in the white heat of championship... What God has put together, let no man put asunder’. There is a reason for not having any of the dogs of war in this team, those who fought with me in the trenches to conquer All-Ireland club glory in  - I can’t or won’t pull that team apart. The one thing from my days of football and hurling at all levels that stands out, is that I really enjoyed the thrill of competing and playing. The players here were all part of the enjoyment factor at ious stages of my career. googletag.cmd.push I count myself very lucky to be a part of some special teams at school, university, club, county and province. There are many lads unfortunate not be in this team. Particularly those who reached the summits of  with me. All of the boys who started that day and made a contribution throughout that year deserve massive recognition. On beer rating and craic alone Fergal ‘Rooster’would walk onto any team. McGilligan, Barton, Burns, Quinn, Coleman, Heaney and Cassidy would walk onto any county team. Gary Doyle, who wasn’t part of the  team, was a superb player for Lavey for many years. googletag.cmd.push You don’t win anything without great players and particularly great characters as well.Management will always be a massive factor in your development and success. Paddy Chivers, Adrian McGuckin, John Brennan, Brendan Convery and weeColeman were all vital in my progress as a footballer. I owe everything to the players and management who made all my successes possible.  - Damien McCusker  Easy solution here. This man was way ahead of his time in the number one spot. He played outfield for his club and it showed in his distribution and confidence with the ball. His kicking out was superb and would have found you with a ‘short’on. A big quiet leader and gentleman as well.Beer rating - ..  - Kieran McKeever  In his era, would have been the first man selected in any Derry side. He was the greatest corner back when you had to play corner back, giving me the freedom to go forward without having a worry behind me. Had many a spat with him in Dungiven colours and we always came out the other side as friends. Class personied.Beer rating –    - Kevin McCloy  Was too young to be about in Lavey’s really successful years but matured into a brilliant full-back. I coached him at U and never saw anyone who could read the game like him at that age. He deservedly got an all-star in  and gave Lavey and Derry many years of great service. Beer rating – .  - Tony Scullion  He would walk onto any team in the land. He didn’t like stretching and once smoked a cigarette while warming up. He didn’t fancy training one bit, yet he was imperious as a defender. This four all-stars tells the tale. He was unlucky not to win a county championship with a very good Ballinascreen team in those years. Beer rating – .   - Paul McFlynn  He played number five after I left the Derry team for many years and was a superb footballer. Paul was a very underrated tackler and always grabbed you a point at the other end. He was unbelievably instrumental in Loups two championship wins and their Ulster triumph. He was quiet but so influential on the pitch.Beer rating – .   - Anthony McGurk  Although, at , he made fleeting and telling impacts for our  team from the bench, I’m going to allow him in here. He is reason why the rest of us played football in the house. We grew up travelling everywhereto watch him. His Derry side wasnt far off the  side in terms of talent. A pure talent, legend, leader and a great influence our family.Beer rating . .  - Joe Irwin  When I came into the Derry team, Joe Irwin was the best player in our county bar none. There was a defiance, strength and ruggedness that yielded him unplayable. Unlucky not to be around in  but was a great player for Derry and a decent Drumsurn team of the ’s. Great lad too. Beer rating – . .  - Anthony Tohill  Anthony was simply the best as an all round player of my time. There was just no one to touch him. He was tall, strong, athletic, skillful, brainy, dedicated and had possessed two good feet. The big man was such a big gentleman as well – there is nothing more to say.Beer rating –  .  - Gregory McCartan . The single most reason why the Down of  regained their levels of . A midfielder who covered serious ground on the pitch and also could kick long range frees. He would always chip in with an odd point from play as well. He was a massive player for Down throughout the s and he could sing nearly as well as he played too! Beer rating –    - Dermot McNicholl  The greatest underage player of all time. I grew up at St Pat’s admiring and living in awe of Spoofer. A great leader in school for me as well as Derry minors. Superbly dedicated footballer who was unlucky not to start in , but made many telling contributions. You couldn’t talk about Derry football without mentioning him.Beer rating –  .  - Brian Conlon  I was a lucky man to play in the same Queen’s team and share a lecture theatre as well.

Its fair to say that this crisis has made many of us pause for thought and re-evaluate not just our own behaviour but also many of our previous beliefs. Our new heroes are the cleaners, carers, delivery drivers, shop workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, nurses and many other professions now commonly described as frontline workers. I was getting a few tyres on my car this week and when I asked the guy had they closed he said no we couldnt as we have a contract with the Ambulance Service and needed to be there to provide help for them and others who needed to go to work.” googletag.cmd.push Without these people putting their own lives at risk the death toll caused by coronavirus would have been off the charts. Prior to all of this, most people took for granted the work done by many of these iniduals. We never really gave it much thought. Now, however, we hail many of them as heroes. We clap for them and we now recognise how much better our society is because of their effort. As I said earlier, a global pandemic has really caused us to pause and reflect and hopefully recalibrate what we as a society should see as important. So, what should we learn from this crisis and what should we build on as a society after it  googletag.cmd.push I used the word recalibrate deliberately because I hope its not a temporary outpouring of sentiment for these many professions followed up by a speedyto the way things were before. Prior to the crisis we saw for example the care sector attract little of our attention or interest. Its a key sector with hundreds of thousands employed right across Ireland and the UK. Salaries are often minimum wage or just above. The work of caring for our loved ones and ensuring they have a good quality of le is often classed as low skilled. Their working conditions and pay never interested many of us or the press media but in this crisis their dedication to care for the most vulnerable members of our society has been astonishing. Their treatment by this government in regard to PPE and testing has cost the lives of hundreds of care workers. Weve clapped for everyone in the NHS and the care workers on many Thursday evenings in March and April. Hopefully after this crisis passes, we will support their right to be paid fairly for the essential frontline work they do. I could say the same for the thousands of cleaners who are on minimum wage and whose efforts kept hospitals and many other facilities open throughout the crisis. Also, think of the hospital porters and canteen staff who are often paid low salaries who risked their own exposure to the virus to care for others. The doctors and consultants are front and centre of this fight and their effort too has been exemplary but the vital effort of many others on the fringe cant be forgotten. And it hasnt just been the workers within the public sector or the low paid within the private sector that have stood out in this crisis. Without a doubt the contribution of charities, community enterprises, social enterprises and co-operatives right across these islands has been remarkable. From delivering vital food parcels to the needy, to making much needed PPE their effort in the midst of this crisis has been remarkable. Thousands of peoplein this city have seen first-hand and benefited first-hand from their efforts. Quite often the support they have given was only possible through thefinancial support from the public sector. This crisis should teach many within the public sector that these partnerships can bring real positive outcomes and should be built on rather than withdrawn after this passes. Many people in broader society see social enterprises often in a bad light. This is partially due to the narrow view of business being solely for profit and TV shows like theDragon’s Den dont help. In reality, Derry has many profitable well runsocial enterprises throughout the city and during this crisis many of them have stood with the community. Hopefully when this crisis is over, we wont allow ourselves to forget the people who kept the economy and society going. We will stand with them and support their calls for better pay and conditions. This week we already seen attempts by the Tories to make migrant NHS workers pay the surcharge be met with a public backlash. It forced the Tories to do a U-turn on the policy. People power does work. We really have to mobilise it more. And its not just me who thinks that this crisis provides the perfect  to build a fairer society. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire CEO of JP Morgan, said last week that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as awake-up call to build a better society. He added: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long.” Jamie Dimon wrote this in a memo issued before the JP Morgan Annual Shareholders Meeting. He went on to say: The last few months have laid bare the reality that even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge.” Mr Dimon is a billionaire banker andJoe Biden wins the US Presidency many believe he will the next Treasury Secretary of the United States. Im not a huge fan of a billionaire banker but I cant disagree with his sentiment. In the US the pandemic showed that the largest economy in the world had far too many workers living from pay cheque to pay cheque. So, as we move forward out of this crisis dont forget who the heroes in the economy were. This will of course mean us putting a higher value on the work that manyof them do.Its a national disgrace how we treat, pay and value the work that carers do. Is it too much to pay them more than pound. per hour to look after our mothers and fathers and grandparents  If you asked  people this question, Im sure the vast majority would agree that care workers are underpaid and undervalued. As a society we need to change this. Im optimisticthat the public sector will see the benefits of real partnerships with the social enterprise sector. The oftenreported public private partnership is not the only option. This crisis has shown that often the private sector is not able toin the same way as a social enterprise can. Finally, I hope that any attempt by politicians to short change or ignore the plight of the workers who held the frontline will be met with a swt backlash from the public. If paying public sector workers more means more taxes, then Im all for that. If increasing the minimum wage to pound per hour means increased prices, then the upside is a fairer society.

On Monday, five of Derry City  Strabane District Council’s  household recycling centres reopened after being closed for a period as a result of the COVID- emergency legislation. Long queues formed outside the centres before they opened as people who were in lockdown attempted to dump and recycle materials that had accumulated. Derry’s centres do not charge people to get rid of their waste. In Donegal people must pay for some items at recycling centres while others are free.  googletag.cmd.push At the most recent meeting of the council, DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the use of the dumps by people from Donegal was a quite serious problem which needed to be examined. Alderman Devenney said that given the costs being faced by the local council as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, they should not be footing the bill for people from a dferent jurisdiction to get rid of their rubbish. He suggested that when the dumps are re-opened the council should look at new measures to prevent people from outside the council area using the facilities. Alderman Devenney asked for a report to be prepared in a bid to try and establish how many vehicles with southern registrations are using the local dumps. googletag.cmd.push Addressing the issue of cross border waste, a council spokesperson this week said that it is aware of ‘some cross border waste’ being brought to its recycling centres by members of the public and that its centres are designed to handle the volume of waste which passes through daily. She said: “This issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis with elected members recently requesting a full report on usage that will come before them for review and discussion at the next Environment and Regeneration Committee. “Council acknowledges the fact that there are many instances where users of the amenity sites live outside of the Council area, for example they may own a property within the Council area. “Council continues to remind people from outside of the council area that where possible they should limit travel and should use services and facilities in their own areas.” The Council spokesperson added that they experienced a high volume of users at the sites when they reopened on Monday and encouraged the public to hold off and avail of the services later in the week. Five centres at Pennyburn, Glendermott Road, Strathfoyle, Claudy and Strahan Road in Strabane are all open from am to pm Monday to Friday, am to pm on Saturday, and Sunday opening from  to pm for Pennyburn, Glendermott Road and Strahan Road sites only. The public are reminded that the council’s regular refuse collection service is fully operational throughout this emergency period and that additional support to deal with excess waste has been provided through a bespoke COVID Waste Helpline –    - and a free Bulky Waste Collection Service that can be booked online on the councils website.

Patricia McCallion, who owns her own hair and beauty salon in Waterloo Street, agreed to be stripped of her make-up and lashes to take part in Pretty Single which airs on Monday. The series sees siximage-concious singeltons embrace the natural lookto try and finda love connection that is more than skin deep. Patricia kicks off the showbygoing on five dates with five dferent guys, while her co-starswatch the dates unfold from the comfort of their sofa – providing supportive and humorous commentary throughout. googletag.cmd.push Mum-of-one and self-confessed romantic, Patricia admits she hides her true self behind make-up to boost her confidence. “It’s putting on a mask in the morning, it’s covering the flaws that you don’t like about yourself, she said. People often say to me you look like you workin the beauty industry and I do like to look the part. I have to look at myself in the mirror all day at work so I want to look mybest. Each of the five suitors have been specially matched to Patricia but she could only take one to dinner. The dates were one after the other and then you had to whittle it down to two and decide which one to take on a proper date, explained Patricia. googletag.cmd.push If I was going on a normal dateId have my make-up done because you want to impress, but the funny thing was the fellas didnt even notice we werent wearing make-up. I felt like I was putting myself out there and it was scary, but at the same time I felt like they were getting to know the real me because I was more vulnerable. Patricia remains tight lipped about who she chose for her date, but revealed she was given the option of going bare faced or wearing make-up. I kind of went for a bit of both, she laughed. She is now looking forward to seeing the show for the first time when it airs on Monday. The trailer came on the other night after Eastenders and I was jumping around the room, she admitted. I kept rewinding it to watch again. Narrated by Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Pretty Single is a Stelly Media production for BBC One Northern Ireland and BBC Scotland. It begins on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday  May at .pm. All six episodes in the series will be available on BBC iPlayer after the first episode is broadcast.

However, concern has been raised about a group of young people who are harassing workers on the site. The construction of the new centre had to be stopped because of the lockdown restrictions. However, work has now recommenced following the easing of some aspects of the restrictions. A spokesperson for Shantallow Community Centre, however, said it was important that the contractors were allowed to get on with the project in peace. Unfortunately they are being harassed by a handful of local young people, the spokesperson said. googletag.cmd.push I am asking all parents and any adults to make a point of walking through the Donkey Field - community centre area when you can - out doing their daily exercise, walking the dog or just to check the site. This centre belongs to you. Don’t let a handful of people spoil it. We cannot risk the contractors having to leave the site again because of a couple of people who are hanging round the Donkey Field and think its a laugh to hassle the builders! googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council Animal Welfare Officers have been tasked with looking into the alleged incident after a report was made to the PSNI in January of this year. A PSNI spokesperson said: “Police in Mid Ulster received a report regarding cruelty to horses in the Magherafelt area in January . “Under the Welfare of Animals Act, District Councils are responsible for the enforcement of the legislation as it applies to non-farmed animals. “This would therefore include horses. The report was subsequently passed to Council Animal Welfare officers who are currently investigating the matter, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mid Ulster District Council confirmed it was aware of the animal welfare complaint and a spokesperson said ‘an investigation is being undertaken into the case’. Images of the alleged incident were published online along with videos that appeared to show a horse with a bloodied mouth and missing front tooth. A further video appeared to show a horse with a rope tied from the fetlock strap over its neck to keep its head in a downward position. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone called for those responsible to be held to account. He said: “A lot of concern has been expressed to me personally and my party colleagues locally about footage which has appeared on social media. googletag.cmd.push “These allegations of abuse must be rigorously investigated and I have contacted Mid-Ulster Council, Animal Welfare, PSNI and the Minister at DAERA. “Abuse of harmless animals is despicable and those responsible must face heavy sentences for their hateful actions.” Mid Ulster councillor Malachy Quinn, who has been campaigning for an Animal Cruelty Register for Northern Ireland, also condemned alleged footage of the incident. “The pictures and videos that have been shared a quite sickening and disturbing,” he said. “This morning I sent an email to Mid-Ulster Council Chief Executive to seek assurances that it will be dealt with as a matter of urgency. “This time last year I started a campaign to introduce an Animal Cruelty Register, where those convicted of animal abuses would have their name placed on it and it could be accessed by animal charities and police to prevent those people having access to animals again. “Under present law they can easily get animals across the border or over in the UK. The events that have come to light over the weekend only strengthen the call for this register. “The videos and pictures show disgusting abuse of horses and the people who are subjecting them to this should never be allowed to own another animal. “The SDLP will be pushing the DERA Minster Edwin Poots to bring forward legislation to create a register and also the Justice Minister Naomi Long to bring in tougher sentences for Animal Abuse.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mid Ulster District Council has the second-worst broadband provision of all Northern Ireland’s council areas, with some households unable to reach  Mbps. MLA for the area, Emma Sheerin, said that broadband was an essential utility for households. “It is a poor reflection on the state that basic utilities like broadband are still out of reach for some rural dwellers,” she said. “The fact that many of us are still in lockdown has meant that internet, which is already a necessary utility in most households, is even more essential. googletag.cmd.push “For those asked to work from home, for students attempting to complete school or university work, even for the most basic contact with friends and family, internet has been needed. This has exacerbated the frustrations of those for whom broadband is intermittent or non-existent, and anyone who has ever watched that wee wheel of buffering when trying to stream a video will know just how disheartening it is!” poundm of funding has been made available for the enhancement of rural broadband through Project Stratum, with just under , currently eligible for help. Ms Sheerin said it was vital the support was targeted at the premises that are most in need. googletag.cmd.push “Myself and my Sinn Feacutein colleagues reminded the department that there is another reality, namely the disparity that exists within the Up to  Mbps category,” she said. “I asked that homes on the smaller spectrum of speed be prioritised, so we would not see a situation where a house receiving broadband of  Mbps is improved to  Mbps, whilst another home  miles up the road, with a speed of  Mbps, wouldnt receive any help. “It was our fear thatcost efficiency was prioritised over need, those far off, hard to reach homes, would see no intervention, just because it was going to cost more to get to them. A delay to the roll out of the project has seen the number of eligible premises drop as broadband providers continue to improve their provision. “Due to upgrades by broadband providers, the number of homes with less than  Mbps broadband speed has decreasedby ,, from , to ,,” said Ms Sheerin. “I welcome this, but onlyit means that all , homes are helped, particularly those with the worst service to begin with. I have asked the minister that this be prioritised, and that work begins as soon as is possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an extensive interview this weeks County Derry Post, the former Kingdom and Hogan Cup winning boss gives a Kerry slant to a feature on the minor clashes with Derry from  to . Derry have lost the services of Conor Glass and Callum Brown since minor level, with former U player Anton Tohill also lost to the AFL. Current Derry captain Chrissy McKaigue had a stint with Sydney Swans, and more recently Conleth McShane attended a AFL combine in Dublin before Christmas. googletag.cmd.push It was the same one Tohill and Oisin McWilliams attended two years ago. McWilliams later spent time in Australia with North Melbourne, in , but wasnt snapped up. Kerrys  goalkeeper Deividas Uosis and  winning captain Mark OConnor, both past pupils of Fitzmaurice have travelled down under, but their prize asset – David Clford – has stayed put. “It wasnt on his radar,” reveals Fitzmaurice of a meeting they had when he was senior manager. “He had no interest in going to Australia, or anywhere . Id say there were definitely approaches made but he wanted to play for Kerry and win All-Irelands with Kerry.” googletag.cmd.push On the flip side, Kerry lost OConnor to the AFL. He won two Hogan Cup medals under Fitzmaurice in Pobalscoil Chorca Dhuibhne. “He is a great guy and a big loss to Kerry,” Eacuteamonn states. “He got made an offer and decided to avail of it. From a Kerry perspective, it is up to us to make sure the players want to stay for the right reason. “If they do stay, they get a good education. There is a good job for them and they are well looked after to allow them to pursue an amateur sport. “Rather than giving out about it, it is always important to look in the mirror...is there anything we can do that would make a players le a bit easierthey do stay at home. David wanted to stay at home and we are delighted that he did.” Playing inter-county doesnt pay the bills, but Fitzmaurice sees a bigger picture. “When you are the manager of Kerry, thats what you want – for the players - to ensure the were happy in their personal and professional lives every bit as much as they are in their football lives. “If they are happy in their personal and professional lives, iniably they are going to be better footballers for it. Its not jobs for the boys, what you are trying to do is to encourage players to get a good education, to go down a route that they are interested in, so they can build a good career as well as being a successful footballer.” RELATED - Tohill waiting to make his mark.

The company has confirmed it has started to unfurlough some of its staff this week to prepare to reopen the majority of its six stores in Northern Ireland, including the store at a business park in the Waterside. Homeware was included in the list of businesses permitted to remain open under the legal restrictions which came into law in Northern Ireland on March . The regulations in England were subsequently updated on May  to include homeware as an essential business, prompting Matalan to begin a phased reopening of its English outlets. The company initially furloughed  staff in the north, but it has now confirmed that it will reopen its stores in Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push A Matalan spokesperson said:“Following the change in government guidance to include Homeware as essential retail on May st, Matalan, as a Clothing and Homeware Retailer with a signicant Homeware business,has been preparing carefully for asafe andphased re-opening stores, culminating in the successful re-opening of a select group of trial stores in England in recent weeks.

They are open from pm to pm, Monday to Friday.ldquoWhile we are open again we are operating under strict guidelines with one-ways systems in place, designated seating areas and a maximum of eight people in the church at any one time, he said.ldquoI had hoped to reintroduce a limited number of sacramentals such as confession and benediction in Kilcoo, as this parish have had very little in the way of services over the last few years due to a shortage of priests. However, diocesan officials have cautioned against it, just now.Fr McKinley, who has been parish priest at Kilmegan for ten years, continued: ldquoThe virus came upon us out to the blue.

I foresee it wonrsquot be any time soon before we are able to facilitate anything like that number, said Fr McKinley has had to reschedule  weddings and postpone First Communions and confirmations until later in the year.He added: ldquoIt is an eerie and uncomfortable feeling to celebrate Mass in an empty church and I long for the day we will see our churches full to capacity once more.ldquoHowever, while the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been temporarily lted Masses are still available on the parish webcam for everyone to view.Magheradroll Church of Ireland Church in Ballynahinch will be open for one hour each Thursday, starting next week.Canon Warren Russell, rector, said: ldquoI welcome the reopening of the church in line with the recommendations made by the Northern Ireland Assembly.ldquoWe will open from am to noon on a Thursday which coincides with market day in the town.ldquoWe want to reassure people that all possible safety measures will be in place to facilitate the opening and provide a quiet space for prayer and reflection once again.ldquoThere will be masks, disposable gloves and hand sanitiser available at the back of the church for people to use.Canon Russell, who has been rector for the past  years, added: ldquoWe will measure the response and review it again in a few weeks.

We were told thathis injuries had been one centimetre one way or the other, it could have been a lot worst. There were terrible injuries but at least there was no injury to his head or spine head.ldquoIt was just a freak accident and hopefully nothing like this will ever happen again. However, Declan has told me that he will be back in the tractor as soon as he can walk.Mrs Keating said Declan had passed his tractor driving test late last year and was used to driving their tractor to her brotherrsquos nearby dairy farm.ldquoThe boys had set off from home and were literally just yards down the road when the accident happened,ldquo she continued. ldquoWe are not sure how but Declan said that one minute he was driving and the next he was flung out the side door onto the road and the tractor ran over him.ldquoThe tractor continued moving and Eoin managed to get it stopped and immediately checked on Declan and called his daddy.ldquoDeclan was fully conscious and realised he was badly injured. He checkedhis legs and arms worked. He thought that his pelvis was broken and wanted to seehe was paralysed and somehow managed to get himself up and walk over to the other verge before his legs gave way. He was sitting up when me and his father arrived at the scene.Mrs Keating said that while both Declan and Eoin were naturally shocked by what had happened, she was proud of both her sonsrsquo presence of mind during the horric accident.ldquoEoin called us  seconds after the accident and we were there within minutes, she said. ldquoDeclan was alert the whole time when the ambulance and paramedics arrived.Mrs Keating and her husband followed behind the ambulance as Declan was rushed to the RVH. An emergency doctor met the ambulance in Kircubbin before continuing on. However, the parents feared the worst when the ambulance pulled over at the tennis courts in Greyabbey.ldquoThe doctor jumped out of the ambulance and told us not to worry, Declan was OK. He was going to give him a blood transfusion as he was losing blood internally and the air ambulance was on its way. Literally, it seemed the helicopter arrived just seconds later and Declan was transferred by air then to the hospital.Mrs Keating said that the blood transfusion was vital to Declan at that time, adding: ldquoFor remote communities where we live, the air ambulance is an essential service. They only have started carrying blood supplies earlier this year. If he hadnrsquot have gotten the blood, he may not have been here.Declanrsquos injuries were found to be signicant. He sustained a broken pelvis, perforated bladder and bowel, a collapsed lung, three broken ribs, internal bleeding and bruising.Mrs Keating said: ldquoThe accident and emergency doctor said he would have expected anyone  to be in a critical condition with the range of injuries but Declan was in a serious condition which showed us what a fighter he was and he wasnrsquot letting it get the better of him. We took some comfort from this at that time.She said that three teams of specialist surgeons operated on Declan for more than eight hours to deal with his major injuries.ldquoThe surgeons were extremely worried about Declan and I kept askinghe was going to be OK. The surgeon would only say that he was out of immediate danger and that the next - hours would be critical, she said.Declan spent three nights in intensive care before moving into another ward. Mrs Keating said that the care Declan received was ldquofirst-class and spoke of how caring the medics were to their plight.ldquoDeclanrsquos father and I wanted to be with him through the night. At one point the ward sister called us over and offered us the sleep room the surgeons use for rest during their sht. They gave up that room for us for three nights so we could be with Declan and we saw just how busy they all were. We thank them from the bottom of our hearts for their kindness.The family say they were overwhelmed by the support and well wishes they received from their local community and their donations to the appeal.Mrs Keating added: ldquoDeclan will recover and he canrsquot wait to be up again at am every morning to help on the farm as he just loves the farming le. The air ambulance was the legacy of Dr John Hinds [the late emergency medicine specialist] and it would be remiss of me not to remember him and what he did for others during his le and his campaign to get the service. We are forever indebted to him and the air ambulance service for saving Declanrsquos le.ldquoRegarding farm accidents in Northern Ireland, we know we are one of the more fortunate families and we are so thankful. I hope people continue to give money as itrsquos a vital service for the whole of Northern Ireland.To donate go to www.justgiving fundraising eoin-keating..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C May 27%2C 2000  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH ndash Residents at a Ballynahinch housing estate are due to hold talks with a range of key officials this morning in a bid to raise the profile of the area.People from the Hillcrest Drive area in the town are due to meet with senior officials from the Housing Executive, Down Council and the Department of Environment.The meeting comes in the wake of recent vandalism attacks in the Windmill Street area which damaged a number of cars, homes and business properties.Prior to this morningrsquos meeting, residents met with local councillor Anne McAleenan to discuss their concerns and prepare for the crucial talks with the representatives of the statutory agencies.Last weekend, the local councillor discussed with residents their concerns and advised them to draw up a strategy and work closely with the ious agencies who could provide them with key assistance.One of the main concerns is an area at the top of Hillcrest Drive which residents would like to see the Department of Environment cleaning up to enhance the image of the area.In addition, residents are calling for environmental improvements and also believe sealing off the rear of the estate from the lough area could prevent trouble at weekends.KILLYLEAGH ndash The impact a young Killyleagh footballer is having on the international soccer stage was praised at Monday nightrsquos meeting of Down Council.Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne highlighted the achievements of  year-old David Healy who marked his Northern Ireland debut with a brace against Luxembourg and another strike against Malta.Mr Osborne said the young Manchester United star was a great ambassador for the area and last week received the international personality of the year award at the annual Northern Ireland soccer writers awards sponsored by Guinness.The local councillor said Healyrsquos success for Manchester United and the Northern Ireland team was a great boost for the area.ARDGLASS ndash An Ardglass couple are waging a war against hostile waters in an attempt to circumnavigate Ireland for charity.Rhonda and Vincent Kearney set sail in their -foot boat, Invinceable, on Saturday to make their way around Ireland in a bid to raise pound, to help buy a new leboat.And while the duo is no stranger to challenge, both sailors admit they face a fearsome feat.Vincent is a former Red Arrow and a stunt motorcyclist, while his we, Rhonda, is the former British clay pigeon shooting champion, but nothing, they say, could prepare them for the journey they are now making.ldquoWe only concocted the plan three months ago and thought we had better act quickly before we have time to think about what we are letting ourselves in for, said Vincent.ldquoI have been sailing on and off for about  years and have owned boats for quite some time, but it will still be extremely dficult, particularly with the dreadful weather forecasts we have been given.

Even so, there is a palpable sense of joy among the golfing fraternity.St Patrickrsquos Golf Club in Downpatrick resumed last Wednesday and the captain, Robert McCausland, said he ldquowas absolutely delighted.ldquoThe club is very pleased to be up and running again, he remarked.ldquoWe are very grateful to our green keepers who continued with their work during the lockdown and have delivered a golf course in magnicent condition for the members to enjoy.Mr McCausland said the club was now open to new members and that there were a ldquonumber of very attractive offers in place for those who may wish to take up the game of golf.He added: ldquoThe time sheets over the last few days are quite full and the car park has been busy with lots of smiling, happy faces about the club.Wednesday also saw the reopening of Ardglass Club and Paul Vaughan, the clubrsquos director of golf, said the course has been full up ever since.ldquoOur members have been playing in three-balls and going off every  minutes. We havenrsquot had a spare space since we re-opened, he said.ldquoEveryone is delighted to be back and itrsquos great to see so many people about. I think our members were glad to get out of the house and back on to the golf course.ldquoWe have a marshal at the front gate and the members are obeying the all the guidelines so that they can play casual golf.Mr Vaughan said the loss of visitors represented the loss of a major source of income for the club, but hoped this would be offset by new members.ldquoWe have had a lot of enquiries about new members, but visitorsrsquo green fees are a huge part of our business, he said.ldquoHopefully, we will be able to salvage something towards the end of the season and things willto something near normal next year.At Spa Golf Club, near Ballynahinch, which re-opened on Friday, the captain, Gordon Martin said everyone was ldquoexcited at the expectation of getting back playing in a sport we love so much.He went on: ldquoI am very aware of the sacrices many people have made in our communities that allows us to get to this point. May I on behalf of Spa Golf Club members and their families thank all the heros in out communities.ldquoSpa recognises the great responsibility golf has in being one of the first sports to re-open after the lockdown and fully intends to adhere to all the protocols agreed by our governing body.He said the club had been fortunate to be able to keep some greens staff working at the club over the lockdown period.ldquoThe driest April on record put extra burdens on green keeping staff in terms of additional watering and essential maintenance. But we are pleased to say the course is looking just magnicent.Mr Martin also said it has been a dficult period from a financial point of view with not many golf clubs being eligible for any signicant assistance under the ious Covid finance packages.Bright Castle Golf Club, which is privately owned by the Ennis family, has also been busy since it re-opened last Thursday.ldquoThe course is looking magnicent and the members are enjoying it, said Linda Ennis.ldquoItrsquos been a tough few months, but wersquove worked hard to keep the course maintained to a high standard and itrsquos really looking the part.ldquoThe members are glad to be out playing and itrsquos great to see so many happy faces.ldquoThe last time the course was closed this long was about six or seven years ago and that was because of heavy show. It was a bit disheartening having the place empty in April and earlier this month when the weather was lovely.She added: We rely on visitors and societies for a good portion of our income, but we have had enquiries about new memberships, which is good news for us.Crossgar Golf Club president Paddy Bell heaped praise on the clubrsquos green keeping staff for having the course in great shape and also revealed there has been a surge in new members.ldquoWe have had a big uptake in new members in the past few weeks, which will help compensate for the lack of green fees, he said.ldquoWe re-opened last Wednesday and itrsquos fantastic to see people playing again. It gives you hope that everything may soonto normality.ldquoThe course is in great condition and thatrsquos due to the green keeping staff who have worked hard during the lockdown. All praise is due them.Temple Golf Club has also been inundated with membership enquiries. Since it re-opened last week it has welcomed  new junior members.Owner Tim Martin said the pandemic lockdown couldnrsquot have come at a worse time with membership subions due on April .ldquoAs like every other club, our income disappeared overnight. We depend heavily on the income from the restaurant and bar and our cash flow dwindled rapidly, Mr Martin said.ldquoWe were only able to continue paying our staff each week because of some of the loyal members who paid their fees on time. To them we are very grateful. This kept us ticking over until the government job retention scheme kicked in.Mr Martin said the members had been very accommodating and were adhering to the guidelines and protocols.ldquoWe look forward to progressing into the next stage, but will have to make sure it will be financially viable to open the restaurant and bar when the time comes, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland man Gerry praises Move More initiative  ","story":"THERE are not many who have been to the top of the majestic Efel Tower in France.But Loughinisland man Gerry Morgan is one of the lucky few who have made it to the summit to snatch a birdrsquos eye view of the stunning Parisian landscape.That was  years ago when he opted for the easy option by popping into the lt and by-passing the , steps. Just recently, Gerry made it back to the top of the famous landmark again mdash only this time he did it from the comfort of his own home.A decade ago, Gerry enjoyed good health and loved every minute of his visit to France but in  Loughinisland GACrsquos hard-working secretary contracted lung cancer, having never smoked a day in his le.In September that year, surgeons removed one of his lungs and between then and Christmas Gerry received chemotherapy treatment to assist his road to recovery.As a result of his illness, he was referred to Macmillanrsquos lsquoMove Morersquo initiative at Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick, which is specically designed to help people to get active and stay active with physical activity during and after most types of cancer treatment.Under the watchful eye of initiative co-ordinator Laura McGrath, Gerry loved the camaraderie of being with others referred by medical staff to take part in physical activity which can help educe the side effects of treatment, prevent the occurrence of other long-term conditions and reduce the risk of cancer spreading or ing.ldquoThere were just four of us at the start, recalled Gerry. ldquoWe started off in the old leisure centre which was subsequently replaced by a more modern building and there are now around  people who take part.ldquoWe all look forward to the classes every Thursday morning and after our warm-up routine we then proceed around a circuit and spend time on ious equipment, including a rowing machine. We also do sit-ups and squats.After the exercise regime it is time for a coffee and a chat, which all the Move More participants thoroughly enjoy.ldquoWe are literally one big family as many of us have been through cancer and fortunately come out the other side. In a way, illness has brought us together, continued Gerry.But everything changed in March when the arrival of the coronavirus forced Newry, Mourne and Down Council to close all its leisure centres and public buildings.To keep everyone involved, Laura mdash one of  Move More coordinators funded by Macmillan in every council area across the province to support those living with cancer mdash created an app to enable people to keep in touch remotely and exercise at home.She also recently unveiled a new initiative encouraging people living with cancer to virtually climb their way around some of the worldrsquos top landmarks to stay active during the coronavirus pandemic, without leaving the comfort of their own homes.Laura said that while Move More members were not able to physically travel the world at the moment, there was no limit to their imagination.Participants were given the choice of a number of buildings to scale, including Londonrsquos imposing Big Ben.Not surprisingly, Gerry opted to head back to the top of the Efel Tower, only this time he didnrsquot have to leave his front door during the virtual challenge. He set off at a leisurely pace and over three days and, with a little je nous said quoi, made it to the top.ldquoI could have completed the climb in two days, but decided to do it over three instead, he joked. ldquoI really enjoyed doing it, but miss being with my Move More friends.Gerry is pleased that while face-to-face classes and appointments are not possible, Laura has been working on positive, fun and interesting ways to keep programme participants motivated and active in the comfort of their own surroundings.He is also looking forward to getting back to the Down Leisure Centre when it is safe to do so and the pandemic is no more.Recalling the first time he went to the centre following his referral, Gerry admits that he was a little apprehensive.ldquoI distinctly remember driving to Downpatrick and was so nervous that I almost turned the car around to go back home, he said. ldquoBut I continued on and am so glad that I did. It has been an overwhelmingly positive experience for me, one that I thoroughly enjoy.ldquoI was a bit down for a few years after losing my lung and the chemotherapy, but getting involved with the Move More programme changed everything.

recommending that a proposal for a major new housing development comprising  new homes at an  acre site on the outskirts of Ballynahinch should proceed.Their recommendation to approve plans for a mixed development comprising a range of detached, semi detached and townhouses on the Lisburn Road will be discussed at next weekrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee.This particular committee has not met since March as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and to comply with social distancing requirements, the planning meeting will be held at Newry Leisure Centre next Wednesday.In papers submitted ahead of the meeting, the proposed development site mdash which comprises a number of fields mdash is described as ldquoirregular in shape, with the recently constructed Lime Trees, Edengrove and Kinedale developments in close proximity.Planners say that the site earmarked for the new homes is located on the ldquoinner edge of Ballynahinchrsquos development limits, with the area zoned for housing in the Down Area Plan.It is also confirmed in the planning papers that initially, plans were lodged to build  homes, but the figure was subsequently revised after planners expressed concern.The Department for Infrastructure is also content that the proposed housing scheme can be accommodated within the existing roads network.Northern Ireland Water said there is available capacity within the existing sewerage system to cope with the planned new homes, while planning permission has been granted for a new sewage pumping station on adjacent land.The papers indicate that the planning application was submitted in March  and that a number of objections to the proposed development were lodged.Other objections to the proposed housing scheme centre around traffic and access arrangements, claims that the application had not been properly advertised and insufficient neighbourhood notication.Objectors also pointed to the lack of a so-called planting buffer and the ldquolack of effort to integrate an open space area adjacent Ballynahinch River into the proposed development.Another objector highlighted the schemersquos ldquoinappropriate density, arguing that it is greater than other developments closer to the town.The detail of a noise impact assessment submitted to planners has also been questioned, but Newry Mourne and Down Council environmental health officials have expressed satisfaction with the document.The planning papers reveal that an acoustic mound has been incorporated in to the proposed development, with landscaped proposed throughout to mitigate any noise impact on adjacent land uses.In addition, the papers confirm that there is a Tree Preservation Order covering the site and while a number of trees have already been felled, this issue is the subject of an enforcement case.Planners say the proposed development is ldquoappropriate to the character and topography of the site and that ldquoadequate provision is made for public and private open space and landscaped areas as an integral part of the development.They also state that where appropriate, planted areas of discrete groups of trees will be required along site boundaries ldquoin order to soften the visual impact of the development and assist in its integration with the surrounding area, with adequate provision made for parking.Planners say that the development will not have an ldquounacceptable, adverse effect on existing or proposed properties in terms of overlooking, loss of light, overshadowing, noise or other disturbance.Next weekrsquos planning committee meeting takes place two days after the local authorityrsquos annual meeting when it is expected that Rowallane councillor, Robert Burgess, will be

Clubhouses remained closed and no visitors are permitted.Tennis clubs have also been given permission to re-open, again subject to protocols being put into operation.However, other sports remain shut down.Restrictions on Gaelic games are likely to stay in place until July  and there will be no inter-county games until October at the earliest.The start to the cricket season has been delayed, but this week the Northern Cricket Union said it hoped to be in a position soon to announce the first step in ato training..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 Restrictions.jpg","title":"Restrictions begin to ease  ","story":"THERE will be a major easing of lockdown restrictions across the district from today.A number of country parks, harbours, tennis courts and beach car parks will be reopened by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, but strict social distancing measures remain in place with the local authority warning thatthey are not observed, the facilities will be closed.The move to ease some lockdown measures comes after the local authority recently reopened the districtrsquos household recycling centres.But despite the easing of some measures, council campsites, public toilets and cafeacutes across the district remain closed, while mobile vendors are also banned from trading at beaches and forest parks.At last weekrsquos online meeting between the councilrsquos senior management team and the leaders of the local authorityrsquos main parties, agreement to start easing some of the lockdown measures was agreed.Also from today, mountain bike and horse riding trails and the car parks at Castlewellan Forest Park and Tollymore Forest Park will reopen.Public access to the forest parks was agreed two weeks ago, but the car parks remained closed, sparking complaints from residents who live close to both facilities about the number of cars parked along approach roads, hampering sight lines which posed a health and safety risk.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is taking direction from the Northern Ireland Executive on how it slowly starts to ease the lockdown, insisting that progress is determined by public health advice.Two weeks ago, the NI Executive published a five-phase blueprint for lting restrictions but it did not include a timeframe, insisting that it will be guided by scientic and medical advice before it agrees to lt any further restrictions.Local politicians say that they are keen to seen the pathway to recovery progressed, but are reluctant to move too quickly as the virus still has a presence.They are also conscious that with the warm weather predicted to stay, soaring temperatures could place pressure on the districtrsquos hotspots where visitor numbers could increase, as was the case in Newcastle last weekend.With the exception of people who are shielding, visits to immediate family are allowed indoors where social distancing is possible, with churches permitted to open for private prayer, with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.However, with groups of four to six people who do not share a household now able to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing, the local authority feels it is time to allow access to beaches, country parks, harbours and tennis courts.Politicians say they are conscious that easing the lockdown restrictions in one go could push up the all-important R-number, which measures the average rate of transmission.Councillors say the last thing they want is for a situation to arise which would result in having to reimpose lockdown measures and lose the hard won gains that have been made to date.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke and his Rowallane counterpart, Billy Walker, have welcomed the progress being made, but issued a reminder that there will be no leguard facilities at Tyrella beach. However, signs will be in place advising people where it is not safe to swim.The politicians say that council staff will be on duty at beaches, country parks and harbours to ensure required social distancing measures are adhered to. In addition, the number of visitors at the ious facilities will also be monitored, with staff carrying out regular cleaning duties.Cllr Clarke confirmed that local authority staff will be present to engage with the public around guidelines on social distancing and facility information.He said: ldquoWhile these measures will no doubt be welcomed, I would encourage people to be responsible and show consideration for others by continuing to follow the public health guidelines on social distancing and hand hygiene.Cllr Walker said the past two months have been particularly dficult for people across the district.ldquoIt has not been easy and we all hope that people will act responsibly when the beaches, country parks and harbours are reopened. The onus is on them to obey the rules in place which are designed to keep them safe and help prevent the spread of the virus, he continued.Cllr Walker said there were plans to put one-way systems in place, where appropriate, but that all public toilets would remain closed.He added: ldquoI hope that over the coming weeks other facilities will reopen. The fact that we can open beaches and country parks is as a result of local peoplersquos commitment to stay at home to prevent the spread of coronavirus.ldquoWe are making progress and for that to continue it is essential that people continue to adhere to public health advice.

I help my clients achieve their goals by finding that balancebetween nutrition, diet, and exercise.ldquoSome clients, and a lot of men actually, have come to me with problems with anxiety and gut health. For everyone to look after their gut health is something Irsquom verypassionate about.ldquoLast week was Mental Health Awareness Week and I would like people to understand the connection thatwe are feeding our bodies processed food, it can directly impact on our brains and our mental health.Apart from working on her own health and studying to understand what diet and nutrition works for her mdash shersquos vegetarian and stays away from grains, apart from oats and barley mdash Stacey was heavily influenced by holistic approach to health during her late fatherrsquos illness.Mr John Murtagh died in  at the age of  after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer.He was initially told that he has only six months to live and Stacey and her family believe that he helped extend his le through his devotion to nutrition, juicing, mediation and his deepreligious faith.ldquoOnce we heard the news, we researched everything we could to help him nutritionally and holistically, explained Stacey. ldquoWe believe  per cent his faith and his dedication to nutrition and meditation was definitely pertinent to his added time with us. His oncologists thought he was a miracle.ldquoI think it was through what we experienced with my father and my own journey that I knew I wanted to help others nutritionally and how to find their inner happiness and peace.In , she and her brother, Jonathon, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in memory of her dad to raise nearly pound, for Marie Curie.Staceyrsquos own gut health problems were finally diagnosed while she was working in Dubai where she was able to avail of private health service through her job.ldquoI eventually found out that I have visceral hypersensitivity which is typical of IBS and means that the nerves endings in my intestines are exasperated by stress, she said.ldquoMy doctor was very interested in holistic therapies and when he found out that I was doing a lot of HITT [high intensity interval training] but still not losing weight, he recommended switching to lower intensity training such as yoga and Pilates. The dference it has made to my le, along with yoga and a balanced nutritional diet had been incredible.According to Stacey, an open mind and a willingness to test out certain foods to see what triggers your condition are essential for clients to get the right outcome.ldquoJust traditional medicine alone ndash and I would never encourage anyone not to go with traditional medicine ndash is not always the answer. Itrsquos a partnership approach with traditional side and holistic. But most importantly its listening to your own body and what feels right, said Stacey.ldquoClients need to bring a huge trust in the coaching and we really need to work between three to six months and delve quite deep into the personrsquos le to see how we can work together.ldquoIrsquom a big advocate for staying away from fad diets mdash they never worked for me. I believe you have to work to be happy and content within yourself and this is helped by making the right lestyle choices for yourself. Itrsquos about finding balance and what works for you as an inidual and settling into that lestyle.After having a fixed-term contract as a marketing manager before the lockdown, Stacey is no longer working and thinks that this might be the time to push through with yoga and heath coaching full-time.While offering free online yoga classes , Stacey is also offering a complimentary -minute health coaching interview.For further information visit www. staceymurtagh..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20th May 2020 Supporters Club.jpg","title":"Supporters’ club members select their favourite Man Utd team  ","story":"LOCAL Manchester United fans have picked their favourite Reds team of the Premier League era.Members of the Downpatrick Manchester United Supportersrsquo Club were asked to pick their favourite players since the start of the Premier League in .They were tasked with selecting a best eleven along with five subs.

The Passionist Community provides free access to the trails for the benefit of the local community and this is greatly appreciated by the people of Crossgar in particular.Cllr Andrews described Tobar Mhuire as a ldquohaven of peace and tranquillity and appealed to people to stay away from the areas highlighted.He continued: ldquoNo one would want to see public access to the grounds prohibited and the Passionist Community has made this clear.ldquoIt is important that visitors recognise that Tobar Mhuire is home to elderly and vulnerable people, some of whom are self-isolating, and must not do anything that would potentially put their safety at risk. People can continue to use these beautul grounds, but they must recognise the needs of the people who reside there.Cllr Andrews said people in Crossgar were delighted that members of the Passionist Community lived among them and hoped that by everyone following public health advice, it would not be long before some ldquosemblance of normality is restored for everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27th May 2020 UUP.jpg","title":"UUP’s McKee takes vice chairman role  ","story":"ULSTER Unionist councillor Harold McKee has been selected as the new vice-chairman of Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The race for the deputyrsquos position was between the Mournes councillor mdash a former South Down MLA ndash and Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess.Cllr McKeersquos appointment comes weeks after the SDLP confirmed that another Mournes councillor, Laura Devlin, would be the districtrsquos new first citizen, succeeding Sinn Feinrsquos Charlie Casey.Cllr McKee said that it was an ldquoimmense privilege to have been selected as the local authorityrsquos vice-chairman and is looking forward to his new role.First elected to the former Newry and Mourne Council in , Cllr McKee said he has a proven track record of delivery for the benefit of the local community.ldquoI believe in hard work, honesty and accountability in working with local people to raise and solve issues that they care about in their daily lives, said the incoming vice-chairman.ldquoI know that the community is living through unprecedented times and many people are under huge pressure.

However, for some reason that warning was not included in the inquiry’s letter to the two men.For instance, in the written questions sent to former DUP minister Jonathan Bell he was told: “It is vital that the witness statement you provide to the inquiry is your own evidence, absent the influence of others ...”He was also told – as were many other witnesses – that “you may share the correspondence and the enclosed notice with your legal representative, but neither you nor they may show, communicate the contents of, nor provide this correspondence or the notice to any other person or organisation without the express permission of the RHI Inquiry. Any breach of this duty of confidentiality is actionable at the suit of the inquiry chairman”.Mr Bell, again in common with many witnesses, did not receive an offer to meet the solicitor to the inquiry, Patrick Butler.However, in his letters to Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, Mr Butler said: “If it would assist you, I am happy to meet with youto discuss the requirements of the Section  Notice and what evidence you may be able to provide which is within the scope of the Section  Notice.”By contrast to the identical evidence provided by Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, when Sinn Fein ‘super spad’ Aidan McAteer was asked some of the same questions, his answers were worded dferently – as were those of the spad to then finance minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir, Eoin Rooney.The questions to all of the Sinn Fein figures had been around an Ofgem employee, Edd Fyffe, who had contacted Sinn Fein in January  and presented himself as a whistleblower, setting out a series of allegations against Ofgem, which runs RHI for Stormont.Each of the republicans said that they had handled his allegations appropriately and neither they nor Mr Fyffe were called to give oral evidence to the inquiry.The News Letter asked whether Mr Howell or Mr Lynch discussed with each other how they would respond to the inquiry and,not,how they could explain the remarkable similarity between their answers.At the time of going to press, there had been no response, despite repeated requests for comment.Mr Howell and Mr Lynch, along with veteran IRA man Padraic Wilson, had been the triumvirate of senior republicans to whom Mr Ó Muilleoir passed a series of complex policy decisions around RHI – even though none of them are energy experts, lawyers or serve as spads who are bound by civil service codes.Amid alarm from senior civil servants, Mr Ó Muilleoir had asked Mr Howell: “Would you be contentI were to sign off on the business plan on Wednesday afternoon ”The former finance minister insisted that he had been merely consulting the influential republican close to Gerry Adams and not seeking his consent to the plan for retrospective cost controls.However, the RHI Inquiry ruled that was not what had happened and Mr Ó Muilleoir had indeed asked for the publicly unaccountable republican’s consent for the massive decision.—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch on social media.There is a lsquoPODS public grouprsquo on Facebook, PODS quiz nights are being held on Zoom, and there is a website to keep track at podspenarth.org article_url   content_id   site_id

much more than just a parading body and has had a very positive impact in all areas of the county.“Almost as soon as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic became known and lockdown was implemented, the  district lodges and many private lodges in Co Armagh made spontaneous and impressive efforts to assist in their local communities.Rt Wor Bro Denis Watson, County Grand Master, and Wor Bro Jeffrey

been able to liaise by having regular Zoom conference meetings and this has proved very beneficial in maintaining contact and co-ordination.” Reflecting on the work he said: “It’s a very commendable effort by the Orange brethren of Co Armagh and of course this is being replicated in other counties within the jurisdiction of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\"

members discussed a report recommending all Council led events are cancelled until the end of August.Council’s Head of Tourism, Artsand Culture, Brian Johnston, advised members there will be a further report in June that will give consideration to events held until the end of December .The report, circulated to members before the meeting, states that at present, events involving gatherings of people are not permitted and it is anticipated that when they are, other controls such as social distancing will be required.Some of the events recommended for cancellation include Buskfest in Banbridge Town Centre on June , Armed Forces Day in Banbridge Town Centre and Rugby Club on June  and the Seven Hills Blues Festival in Armagh which runs from August -.Other events for later in the year, including the Georgian Festival in Armagh and Halloween events across the borough and Christmas and twilight markets are all marked for further consideration.When asked by Banbridge Sinn Fein councillor, Kevin Savage why an estimate of council savings was not includedin the report Mr Johnston said Council would have spent £, on the events it now proposes to cancel.However, he did advise that not all of that will be saved by Council as some contractual obligations will need to be met.SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon raisedthe possibility of holding some of these events virtually.“We are encouraging businesses to do things online,” said the Armagh representative.“If we could look at some of these events happening between now and Christmas and seethere is an opportunity to do similar with them, could we have that explored and brought back in due course ”Lurgan councillor Liam Mackle said: “I would be very happy with some virtual events taking place in the months ahead.”The Sinn Fein representative then proposed that Council officers explore this idea and report back in due course with the proposal seconded by Councillor O’Hanlon.A message from the
