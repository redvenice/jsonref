I think what most people watching or listening to this will question is \u0027\u0027what about my time?\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027Those are all amazing things, I would simply love to do them but I don\u0027t have enough time in the day\u0027\u0027. \u0027The distractions of life, whether you\u0027ve got work complications or every element of our life becomes busier and busier and busier. Then add on top of that, the attention economy of media, social media, pulling you in all sorts of different directions as well, again it goes back to everything you said. \u0027Most people will sit there and listen and think that\u0027s fantastic but I don\u0027t have the time. Well the good thing is, you can make time. \u0027And if you don\u0027t have time then you probably need to make time even more. I, similar to you Alexi, experienced burnout and throughout that burnout literally getting to the very end of everything I had. \u0027I was burning the candle at both ends. And just went boom. And that is when you are forced to look inside yourself. Because with everything else around you you feel as though it\u0027s working against you but the only way you can really combat it, the only way you can build resilience for the outside world and your entire environment is the inner work. \u0027Because if you work out how and why you react to certain people, certain situations you can gain control of those situations. Doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not gonna happen, it means that your reaction to them is more in your control.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so profound Harry, and I\u0027m glad you mention this point of time. Could you share a little bit more about what that experience and journey has been like for you and what are some ways you\u0027ve seen success in investing in your mental fitness?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027It has to start from yourself. This idea that you can somehow find mental fitness from other people. Yes, as a team you can certainly encourage each other but it starts at home and it starts internally. \u0027And the effect that has for yourself and reaching your own peak performance but also the people around you and if you\u0027re a business leader then also your employees as well, to go \u0027\u0027you know what everyone\u0027s gonna have today focusing on themselves\u0027\u0027. \u0027That doesn\u0027t mean that necessarily everyone\u0027s going to take them up on that offer but as I said at the beginning everyone has such busy days anyway that even if you do have that 15 min slate of white space...\u0027By the way I now put in about half an hour or 45 minutes in the morning when it\u0027s like \u0027\u0027okay one of the kids has gone to school the other one\u0027s taking a nap right there\u0027s a break in our programme\u0027\u0027.  \u0027It\u0027s either for workout, to take the dog for a walk - get out in nature. Maybe meditate, I know that I need to mediate every single day. I would hope that everybody would be able to do that but the reality is that once your time starts slipping away and once you have other commitments in your day or you need to be there to show up for other people, guess what, the self care is the first thing that drops away. \u0027And I\u0027m happy to admit that as a husband, dad, someone\u0027s who\u0027s starting up a business but then think about the single dads, single mums you just don\u0027t have the time to be able to do that. \u0027So yes I think the point here is that when it comes to mental fitness it\u0027s the pinnacle, it\u0027s what you\u0027re aiming for and the road towards that can be really bumpy, it\u0027s called inner work for a reason. \u0027And I think that immediately might put some people off. Going \u0027\u0027more work?\u0027\u0027 But the outer work becomes so much easier once you get to grips with the inner work and then everything starts to fall into place.\u0027\u0027Serena Williams: \u0027Do you find that that work that you do on yourself, because you know I\u0027m still learning, is that like an everyday thing or is this like a few times a week? \u0027I know how much nervous system is gonna react to certain situations that are out of my control. What can I do, what have I got in my toolbox that I know works for me? \u0027What is readily available and it\u0027s different for every single person...\u0027You\u0027ve got to put it in like just as much as brushing your teeth every morning it\u0027s got to be straight after something that\u0027s already in your day diary of this is a habit, I need to make it a habit. \u0027If it\u0027s not a habit then it\u0027s the first thing that drops away from your busy day.\u0027 \u0027Life is about learning, right. If you\u0027re in your 20s, your 30s, your 40s and even your 50s and you think that you\u0027ve got it sorted, then bad stuff\u0027s gonna happen. \u0027There\u0027s a lesson here, there\u0027s a lesson. I\u0027m being schooled by the universe. There\u0027s something in this for me to learn so that next time this happens I become more resilient or being able to see a way around it to be able to achieve the ultimate goal. \u0027And if you have that perspective then every single bad thing that happens, actually can be good.\u0027 Mr Robichaux: \u0027You know one reason we\u0027re doing this with companies is around this matter of what we were talking about is we need to reframe inner work as part of the job. Harry I\u0027m curious, what does that bring up to you? You\u0027re building a business, you\u0027re an entrepreneur, how do you think about this?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027From an employer perspective you can\u0027t expect in today\u0027s world your people to put in the work on themselves when you\u0027re not giving them the time to be able to do that. \u0027Which is why I think it\u0027s so important as employers going \u0027\u0027you know what, if you wanna be able to do, if you have the chance to be able to do it in your own spare time, that\u0027s fantastic we fully support you. But we are going to factor that in to your routine at work\u0027\u0027. \u0027If everybody was doing that, the shift in global consciousness and awareness and self awareness would be enormous, would be vast. Again, the proof is in the pudding. \u0027Look at these companies that signed up or that had a BetterUp coaches for the last however many years and the numbers speak for themselves. The employees their potential their performance at work but also at home has increased tenfold in some cases. \u0027So not only are they better at work, therefore as an employer \u0027\u0027you\u0027re welcome, you\u0027re getting more out of me than you thought you would\u0027\u0027 but also you\u0027re creating more capacity and more ability for those iniduals when they go home to show up and be the person they need to be for their friends and their community. \u0027To be the parent they need to be for their kids. So it is one whole cycle of connectivity that ultimately means everybody around you starts to benefit. That\u0027s the way I see it.\u0027Mr Robichaux: \u0027I think that\u0027s so well said. What\u0027s your experience been with coaching?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027To have someone there who\u0027s not only coaching you through life but as part of that is challenging your perspective. \u0027That\u0027s what I ask from my BetterUp coach on a weekly basis. I can\u0027t wait for BetterUp to be in that position to be able to make it even more accessible for people so that every single person anywhere around the world had access to a BetterUp coach and you know the biggest challenge we\u0027re gonna have is finding enough coaches. \u0027Because the demand is there, the need is there. The need\u0027s not gonna go away guys, we know that. The world\u0027s becoming harder and harder and more complicated and that\u0027s just an observation. \u0027I think people are gonna need to rely on each other and on professional help but also friends, family, maybe complete strangers. Anyone can actually help you in that coaching process. \u0027To be able to have different points of view in your life and friends who will not worry about pushing back on things that you say or things that you feel to be able to make you, well not make, encourage you to be able to see it more clearly, I view that as trying to surround myself with people who I would happily have washing the windscreen and clearing those filters so that you can be able to see your own life and the reality of that life more clearly rather than this endless filter system of what you think is happening.Mr Robichaux: \u0027I love this conversation about coaching. Before we wrap is there any final advice or coaching you would share in relation to practicing mental fitness or investing in inner work?\u0027Prince Harry: \u0027Life is about discovery. In that discovery you\u0027re gonna find things that you don\u0027t like, that make you uncomfortable. \u0027You\u0027re gonna find things that are constantly pushing back on you but as you work your way around those things, all of a sudden all of the stresses and chaos and all the things that were working against you in your life. \u0027Be it private life, work life, whatever it is that work life balance, all of the things getting in your way either fall away or you visualise them and are able to turn a negative into a positive and therefore make those things work for you.\u0027And when you get to that point, from my perspective is feels like a superpower, but it takes time. It\u0027s constant, it\u0027s a work in progress. \u0027For me personally it\u0027s like constantly buffering. It\u0027s a work in progress, some days are great some days are really hard. \u0027And no matter what I put into it I am always kicking myself going \u0027\u0027if you\u0027d done this this this which you know works for you, then you wouldn\u0027t be in this state now\u0027\u0027. \u0027So again it\u0027s work but out of all the work we do and all the things we work towards, it is the most fulfilling work apart from being a dad.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Sadiq Khan puts Cressida Dick notice demands urgent plan","story":"Share this articleCharing Cross police officer threatened to kill female colleague | News | The TimesMet officer was promoted despite misconduct over sexist and racist messages | Metropolitan police | The Guardian"},{"url":null,"title":"BBC barrister disbarred forging judges signature dupe dirty dossier author","story":"Share this article Tribunal chair Judge Alan Greenwood said: \u0027Everybody is entitled to expect that an order of the court is a genuine document, and not a fabricated one, and the extent of the fabrication is very real.\u0027To fabricate a court order, one can\u0027t imagine that a barrister would do that, or countenance that a barrister would do that.\u0027If a barrister does that, it is high dishonesty indeed.\u0027It wasn\u0027t fleeting, it was not momentary, it was a course of conduct.\u0027\u0027This is a court order, the signature of a senior Master of the High Court, and that document was being fabricated in order to mislead the client.\u0027Cain told the tribunal in a written statement: \u0027I wish to make absolutely clear, at the outset, that I accept, as I did in the self-report which I submitted to the SRA and to the BSB, that within a short space of time I made a series of very serious errors of judgment and, in doing so, I let down my client, my colleagues and fellow partners, the firm, the profession and myself.\u0027I am profoundly and sincerely sorry for my conduct, which I wish I could put right.\u0027I regret it every day and I acknowledge the severity of that conduct.\u0027Nothing I say in this statement is seeking to diminish the seriousness of my misconduct.\u0027I have publicly issued a profuse apology for my conduct, as well as apologising to the firm, and I wish to repeat that apology now.\u0027Cain, called to the bar in July 2005, admitted failing to act in the best interests of a client, failing to act with honesty and integrity and failing to provide a competent standard of work to a client.She also admitted behaving in a way which is likely to diminish the trust and confidence which the public places in a barrister or in the profession and failing to observe her duty to the court in the administration of justice.Cain worked as a barrister in the litigation department at the BBC before she moved to RPC\u0027s highly regarded media practice in 2017.She was disbarred and ordered to pay £5,900 costs."},{"url":null,"title":"Dutch residents vow hurl EGGS Jeff Bezoss newly built 400m Y721 superyacht","story":"Share this article\u0027A bridge too far\u0027: local anger at dismantling of historic bridge for Bezos boat -

who attended despite Russia being officially banned due to doping - sat with his arms folded and eyes closed for several seconds on TV feeds as Ukraine\u0027s athletes processed into the Bird\u0027s Nest stadium on Friday. It comes amid fears he is about to invade their home country, sparking the worst standoff with the West since the Cold War.Russia does have athletes at the Games, but they are forced to compete as the \u0027Russian Olympic Committee\u0027 and cannot use the country\u0027s flag on their uniforms or play the national anthem when they win. Separately, a Russian Olympic official was filmed arguing with a Ukrainian official shortly before the ceremony took place - appearing to brand him a \u0027loser\u0027 and a \u0027b*****d\u0027 despite Olympic organisers insisting the Games would symbolise peace and togetherness in an increasingly ided world.Meanwhile Xi Jinping received a standing ovation as he arrived to watch some 3,000 performers take part in the ceremony, which also featured frog-marching People\u0027s Liberation Army soldiers hoisting the country\u0027s flag as the national anthem played.Earlier in the day, Xi had given his backing to Putin over Ukraine -

The team was set to boycott the games over their team name, but were told by organisers they had to attend. Putin was one of just a handful of foreign dignitaries to attend the events after most Western leaders boycotted over China\u0027s human rights record and persecutions of Uighur Muslims in eastern Xinjiang province.  "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026"},{"url":null,"title":"we feel exploited international students on studying in ireland","story":"Ronald Wafula, an international PhD student. ‘It is practically impossible to live any life.’  Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Ronald Wafula wakes before dawn. He uses the quiet time to get some study done before starting on a two-hour and 40-minute journey by bus to college. Originally from Kenya, Wafula is one of some 21,000 international students studying in Ireland, many of whom are struggling.He was elated when he won a scholarship to research a PhD in finance at University College Dublin (UCD) in September 2020. Looking back, he wasn’t prepared for the challenges that lay ahead. Every day is a struggle to make ends meet, he says.His first year of study was online due to Covid restrictions. After securing temporary housing, it took Wafula more than 10 months to find suitable accommodation for his family to come to Ireland. He now lives with his wife – who is not permitted to work under her visa – and one of his children in Rathangan, Co Kildare, while the other child stays in Kenya.Wafula gets a monthly €1,500 scholarship stipend. He has worked as a tutor at the university, but his Stamp 2 visa limits him to work no more than 20 hours each week. His hours are precarious and he does not know if he will get any in the current semester.Meanwhile, his income is quickly swallowed up by his monthly rent (€1,100), electricity (€200) and daily commute (€18 a day).“It is practically impossible to live any life,” he says. “It becomes really hard to say you’re enjoying it.”Wafula admits experiencing mental health difficulties throughout his time here. “You have to put on a bold face, so your wife and kids don’t see that... I’m not enjoying the process, but maybe the outcome, which is getting a PhD and hopefully getting a job,” he says.Wafula wrote to UCD president Andrew Deeks in August, claiming international PhD students were “suffering in silence” and facing “systematic” discrimination during their time in Ireland.In a statement, UCD said international students receive an offer pack that references accommodation, the cost of living and visa advice. While the college generally has sufficient on-campus places for international students, it said that it does not currently have family accommodation.The university said PhD candidates have a student status and are deemed to be under full-time instruction, while scholarship holders are exempt from tax on their scholarship income.They are not normally employees, a spokesman said, and issues around employment are controlled by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment.AbroadThe experiences of international students is raising wider questions around Ireland’s policy of attracting more and more students from abroad.While their higher fees are helping to plug holes in third-level funding, many international students argue that they are not being treating fairly and are not adequately warned about the cost of living or scarcity of accommodation.In Ireland, about 17,000 students from outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) are paying €10,000-€20,000 for their courses, though in some cases fees can be as high as €55,000.Most non-EEA students come from the US, China, India, Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia. Irish students pay a student contribution charge capped at €3,000.Bukky Adebowale, vice-president for equality and citizenship at the Union of Students in Ireland, says many international students feel they are treated as if they are cash-cows to prop up an under-funded third-level system. “They don’t feel heard,” says Adebowale.Bhumi Mehda, who is studying for a master’s in computer science, is one of them. She was required to have €40,000 in her bank account before being accepted into the State. On top of needing €25,600 for tuition fees at UCD, and after receiving some financial help from her parents, she took out a loan to finance the high cost of living in Ireland – but it still wasn’t enough.After arriving from India with her sister Jill at the end of the summer, she was met with the stark reality of Ireland’s housing crisis. Although they contacted 20-30 places a day, they struggled to find permanent accommodation. The sisters spent a month in temporary accommodation and were “freaking out” in fear of having no place to go.Less than 48 hours before they were due to leave their temporary accommodation, with no place to go, they finally secured a year-long tenancy agreement – but it didn’t come cheap. Bhumi, Jill and two friends now live close to Belfield campus in Dublin 4 and pay €2,500 a month for the two-bedroom house or €625 to share a bedroom far more than they budgeted.The  contacted all Irish universities to ask if they provide warnings to internationals regarding Ireland’s housing crisis prior to arrival. Many give general advice such as “book early” or tell students about “high demand” in the rental market. NUI Galway seems to go further than most by offering virtual “meet and greets” and information sessions for international students. The university also said it invites housing charity Threshold to provide accommodation guidance to incoming internationals.Bukky Adebowale of USI says the “honest truth” must be presented to internationals before coming to Ireland.Laura Harmon, executive director of the Irish Council for International Students, whose members include 30 higher-education institutions, says she does not think colleges are exploiting students. She argues that universities are following the national strategy on internationalising education in Ireland.But why aren’t students allowed to work more than 20 hours each week to cover their high costs? The Department of Justice, which issues their visas, maintains the sole reason for students being in the State is to study. The department said it must ensure students can survive on their own resources without relying on work.Plugging the gapThe move to “internationalise” higher education is Government policy. The Department of Education’s strategy in this area, due an update since 2020, aims to increase the economic output of these students from €819 million in 2014 to €1.15 billion by 2020 and increase the output of the English-language education sector by €200 million. The policy has been bearing fruit non-EEA students have more than doubled since 2011.The supply of lucrative international students has helped plug university finances in the years following the recession and, more recently, during the pandemic.Latest figures show Ireland’s main universities increased their student fee income in the first year of the pandemic at a time when most were confined to remote learning. No refunds were provided to international students neither were they entitled to the once-off €250 payment from the Government.“Maybe universities should not make so much money at the expense of people paying,” says Wafula.Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris is shortly expected to begin long-awaited action on the 2016 Cassells report, which aims to address key funding issues in the sector. International students like Wafula and Bhumi hope they won’t be left behind in the new vision for the sector.International students: in numbers17,000Estimated number of students from outside the European Economic Area studying in IrelandEstimated economic output generated from international studentsTuition fees for most international students"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord and just like that golfgate is brought to a swift and sudden end","story":"Is that it?Eighteen months of “Golfgate” madness dismissed in four minutes by a no-nonsense judge in a Galway courtroom.Donie Cassidy, Noel Grealish and hoteliers John and James Sweeney must have been as surprised as everyone else at the speed with which the verdict was produced. As day three of holding forth in never-ending circles around the banqueting tables of a golf society dinner drew to a close, most observers expected proceedings to spill over into another day.Senator Michael McDowell SC had just completed an excruciatingly long closing argument (at one point we noted two people asleep in his vicinity) explaining why his client, TD Noel Grealish, had absolutely no case to answer.There were three other senior counsel ready and waiting to do the same.And then suddenly, after months and months of fury and fulmination and acres of newsprint and countless hours of angry back-and-forth across the airwaves, Judge Mary Fahy dismissed the case against Grealish in a few pithy sentences.“Absolutely no evidence to show he was one of the organisers” of the infamous Golfgate dinner in Connemara. “This is a criminal prosecution. I have a reasonable doubt.”It’s a pity judges don’t bang gavels in Irish courts because this would have been the perfect time for some legal percussion. Perhaps they’ll have a gavel in the movie.“So I have to dismiss the charges.”But she wasn’t finished yet.There would be no impassioned closing addresses from Colm Smyth, Eddie Walsh and Constance Cassidy, and all three of them imported at considerable expense from the Inner Bar in Dublin. There would be no grand stand to make on behalf of their clients, because Mary Fahy was in no mood to hang around. She had heard enough.“We have to admit – anyone listening to the case – that the evidence was most impressive,” she declared, singling out witnesses John Flaherty, former captain of the guard in Leinster House, and none other than Mr Justice Séamus Woulfe as being particularly impressive.“Responsible people” who wouldn’t have gone to a dinner if they didn’t feel comfortable or safe.Judge Fahy had no doubt that the defendants did everything they thought they could do to comply with the Covid restrictions.“And in my view they did comply – not in the court of public opinion but in the court of law, in my view, they did.”This was only going one way.“So I am dismissing the charges against all the defendants.”There were no cheers. No high-fiving.Misty-eyedNoel Grealish, who was captain of the Oireachtas Golf Society, was the first politician to emerge. He looked a little flushed and misty-eyed as he stood beside his solicitor and let him do the talking. His lawyer and Oireachtas colleague McDowell, who had just triumphantly talked the case to a conclusion, was beaming.Donie Cassidy (75), who had taken the whole episode very badly, was last to leave the courthouse, flanked by the members of the Westmeath legal massive who handled his case: his senior counsel Colm Smyth, junior counsel and former Labour TD Willie Penrose and solicitor JJ Mannion.In some ways, and after hearing three days of evidence, there was a certain inevitability to this whole sorry saga ending with an emotional Donie standing on the courthouse steps in the drizzle, quoting the words of his late, beloved mother: “The truth always wins in the end.”You knew he was upset because he forgot to thank the Minister for Justice for the use of the hall.A weight was gone off his shoulders and he was mightily relieved, but the strain was etched on his face as he remembered all the people who were lost to Covid and the “friends who lost their position in life” as a result of the controversy.Should he have held the dinner at all? “In hindsight, everyone would do something maybe differently.”A few hours earlier, he was in bits with worry.“What do you think? I don’t know what to think. The last two years, oh, I couldn’t begin to tell ya. There was no talking to them. No talking to them . . . How do you think it will go?”Donie the defendant, disconsolate at lunchtime and thinking he was facing into a fourth day in court. For somebody who had been living with the aftermath of the “Golfgate” furore for 18 months, he still seemed shocked by it all.ConsideredAfter the charges were dismissed, questions were asked about whether he should have organised the dinner. The Westmeath legal massive was having none of it as former Senator Cassidy considered his reply.“The court has ruled,” they muttered behind him. “The court has ruled.” And then they gently nudged their client towards the car.All the talk, all the legal argument forgotten in the shock delivery of the verdicts.Eoghan Cole BL, who argued the case for the DPP and the State, looked disconsolate as he left the building. He had put forward a spirited fight against a star team of legal big guns (and a Supreme Court judge who attended the golf beano giving the benefit of his wisdom on the matter from the witness box). And superb he was too, noted the judge on Thursday.Inspector Peter Conlon – he was the main Garda witness – was given a torrid time in the witness box. He stuck to his view that sticking a temporary partition wall down a room of over 80 people to ide them into two legally acceptable groups did not mean they were attending separate events, or in different rooms.“It’s my assertion that it is one room by virtue of two openings made in the partition,” he said in reply to Eddie Walsh’s cultured bellowing.There were discussions on what constitutes a multiple gathering and what is the definition of an organiser. Does a moveable partition make a moveable feast? How big a gap in the partition is acceptable? Is there a difference between mingling and intermingling? Why did nearly all the witnesses seem to be seated with their backs to the action?What exactly is a “three-shot fourball single stableford Champagne scramble competition”? Inspector Conlon was able to explain that to the court. Guards like playing golf. Barristers like boasting that they know nothing about it, as they did again on Thursday.MeanderingFor all his meandering, McDowell made some excellent points in his closing argument. Not least on the intriguing question of “someone in Dublin”, maybe in the DPP’s office, keen to prosecute some of the main movers in the golf outing because of the public outcry over it?“Doubtless somebody somewhere in Dublin decided that there was a public interest in showing the public that heads would roll . . . Doubtless somebody did that in order to assuage public opinion and anger.”This anger was compounded by people “thinking that 80 people had assembled in secret, more or less, abusing their status as members of the Oireachtas” in contravention of the rules. “That was the source of all that anger and recrimination and all the disastrous consequences that followed.”He reminded the court of the atmosphere at the time.The country nearly melted down with anger, quivered McDowell.It didn’t sound like a great night anyway. Former minister Dara Calleary, who had to resign over his attendance at the function, told how he was escorted to a table and told to stay there unless he needed to go to the toilet.After the decision, some of the victorious lawyers gathered in the opulent bar of the Hardiman Hotel on Eyre Square to have a celebratory drink, watch the six o’clock news and toast the partition.Is this the end of Golfgate?The ranks of The Vindicated may now be seeking reinstatement. RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke has already expressed a desire “to be back on air”. Big Phil Hogan will be like a Cheshire Cat. And Dara Calleary will be eyeing a ministerial return when the next reshuffle happens.As for everyone else, you’ll have to ask all the people who cancelled weddings and other events at the time. If they had known they could have had all their guests in attendance if only they had thought of getting partitions. They won’t be too happy, even if they did the right thing.Judge Fahy may have closed her case, but the court of public opinion is still in session."},{"url":null,"title":"plan to restore senior public sector workers pay must be honoured says imo","story":"Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, those earning more than €150,000 are due the final phase of pay restoration on that date. Photograph: iStockRepresentatives of hospital consultants have told the Government that it must honour plans to restore pay of senior public sector workers.The intervention from the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) comes after it emerged earlier this week that pay rises for senior public servants due to take place in July are in doubt.Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath is to review top-level pay in the public service and he will be establishing an independent review group to examine the process for appointing top public servants and their salaries.Sources said the process is likely to have implications for the final reversal of the austerity era cuts for top earners in the civil and public service, due on July 1st.Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, those earning more than €150,000 are due the final phase of pay restoration on that date.The increases in salary due then are understood to be between 10 and 15 per cent.There is concern in Government that the measure could lead to a public outcry and sources said the Minister would examine “options he has to adopt a revised approach to this issue” – though it remains for now a legal obligation.Other public servants have already seen their salaries restored to pre-austerity levels.The IMO on Friday warned the Government that it “must fully honour all the terms of the Public Services Pay and Pensions Act (2017), and the Building Momentum national pay agreement, including the reversal of the final phase of pay cuts imposed during the period of austerity”.It said it was “dismayed” at reports that the Government is considering changing the schedule as part of a broader review of pay in the public service.The IMO is to seek an “urgent meeting” with Mr McGrath and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to discuss the issue.Dr Clive Kilgallen, chairman of the consultant committee of the IMO, said that a failure to honour agreements on these lines would “confirm the views of many consultants that Ireland was is simply not interested in their skills and expertise, that healthcare management cannot be trusted, and that any agreement is simply not worth the paper on which it is printed”.He also said: “We are in the middle of the worst consultant workforce crisis in the history of the State”, and that there are “dangerous numbers of patients waiting for treatment and over 700 vacant consultant posts, yet the Government continue to target the very people we need to deliver expert care to patients.”Dr Kilgallen claimed the latest reports “just reinforce the impression that Government’s intention is to bully and manipulate those who are required to lead in healthcare delivery rather than empower them to lead as in more successful healthcare systems”.The  has sought comment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform."},{"url":null,"title":"rt%C3%A9 leaves door open but makes no commitment for se%C3%A1n o rourke to return","story":"After the Golfgate case concluded, Seán O’Rourke expressed a desire to return to broadcasting with RTÉ.RTÉ’s has left the door open for Seán O’Rourke to return to broadcasting there in some form in the future but has made no definite commitment as yet.In a response to Mr O’Rourke’s comments on Thursday evening that he “would like to be back on air”, a spokesman repeated on Friday what RTÉ Director General, Dee Forbes said about the matter at the end of 2020.“Seán is a tremendous broadcaster who had a big impact during his time with RTÉ and that if opportunities present themselves, RTÉ will, of course, consider them. This remains the case.”Privately, there are mixed views among former RTÉ colleagues to whom The  spoke on Friday. With all seaking on the basis of anonymity, there was a common view that he would return in some form over the next year, but not on a daily or weekly show, but hosting a one-off series on TV or radio. However, one former colleague expressed a view that because of the passage of time, it might be difficult to find a suitable vehicle for him. Others said the conclusion of the court case had paved the way for negotiations to begin in earnest. Ms Forbes comments on the matter were made five months after the Oireachtas Golf Society event in Clifden, Co Galway which gave rise to the so-called Golfgate controversy. While Mr O’Rourke had no involvement in the case, the fact that the charges were dismissed was being seen by some as a natural starting point in terms of rebuilding his relationship with RTÉ. GuestMr O’Rourke was a guest at the two-day event and had played golf as well as attending the dinner and presentation. He was one of the 81 guests and members who attended the dinner event with the party split into two groups, ided by a floor-to-ceiling partition. At Galway District Court on Thursday, Judge Mary Fahy ruled there had been two separate events when dismissing charges for organising an event in breach of Covid legislation against Independent TD Noel Grealish, former senator Donie Cassidy, and two Clifden hoteliers, John and James Sweeney. After the case concluded, Mr O’Rourke expressed a desire to return to broadcasting with RTÉ.Speaking to The  after the conclusion of the case, Mr O’Rourke said the outcome was a relief to everybody who attended the event in Clifden in August 2020. Mr O’Rourke was one of the guests invited to the two-day event in Connemara. Recently retired from RTÉ at the time, on foot of the controversy the broadcaster decided not to proceed with a new contract for Mr O’Rourke due to run from 2020. “I followed the trial closely and the outcome is a relief not just to the defendants but to everyone who attended on the assurance that it complied with the rules,” he said. “The aftermath was traumatic for me but many thousands of people suffered far more than I did from the pandemic.”He said the atmosphere in the State was febrile at the time. “I lost a good contract to resume the work I love. That had a big effect on me and my family. What happened happened and I’m glad the case is over.“I would like to go back on air. I have good relations with many people in RTÉ and I am hopeful that a way will be found for me to work again with RTÉ on radio and television,” he said.

Planned pay increases for the most senior public servants in July of this year, which would reverse cuts made during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, could be deferred or cancelled under plans by the Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath to review top-level pay in the public service.Mr McGrath indicated on Wednesday at the Oireachtas finance committee that he intended to establish an independent review group to examine the process for appointing top public servants and their salaries.It is understood that as well as looking at how posts are filled, the new group will examine how more private sector applicants can be attracted to senior roles in the civil and public service.Sources say the process is likely to have implications for the final “restoration” of the austerity era cuts for top earners in the civil and public service, due on July 1st. Under the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017, those earning more than €150,000 are due the final phase of restoration on that date. The increases in salary due then are understood to be between 10-15 per cent, sources say, a measure that people in Government fear could lead to a public outcry. Sources said the Minister would examine “options he has to adopt a revised approach to this issue” – though it remains for now a legal obligation. Other public servants have already seen their salaries restored to pre-austerity levels.Robert Watt’s €300,000 salarySeparately it has emerged that senior civil servant Robert Watt’s salary is on course to top €300,000 in October when the last increase in the current public sector pay deal kicks in. The public sector pay deal increase is separate to the July financial crisis cuts reversal which does not apply to Mr Watt. There has been controversy over the €81,000 pay rise Mr Watt received when he was appointed as the secretary general of the Department of Health on a permanent basis in April last year. Oireachtas finance committee chairman John McGuinness– who has been highly critical of the initial €81,000 pay increase for Mr Watt – has said he should not get further increases.However, during an appearance at the committee on Mr McGrath said that further increases are part of the wider public sector pay deal and that excluding an inidual is not the way collective agreements are done. Mr McGuinness’s committee, along with the Public Accounts Committee, examined the issue of senior public sector executives’ pay following questions concerning the process involved in Mr Watt’s appointment to the Department of Health post on an interim basis in January 2021 pending an open competition for the permanent role.The committees’ report found that the interim appointment and salary increase were arranged in an “ad hoc fashion following discussions among a small number of senior officials and members of the Government”.Mr McGrath said on Wednesday that he has considered the report and his intention is to propose the establishment of an independent, external review panel to strengthen the recruitment process for senior public service posts including making recommendations on the process of determining terms and conditions for such posts. Mr Watt said last April that he would waive the €81,000 increase “until the economy begins to recover and unemployment falls”.It was confirmed last week that he was taking the full salary which at that point stood at €294,920 – including a civil service pay increase that kicked in last October. The department did not say when Mr Watt stopped waiving the increase.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has since confirmed to Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy that Mr Watt’s pay rose to €297,869 as of Tuesday under the Building Momentum public sector pay deal.Mr McGrath confirmed another 1 per cent increase is due for civil servants from October 1st. Mr Watt’s salary is set to top the €300,000 mark at that point."},{"url":null,"title":"new zealand to slowly reopen borders as support for jacinda ardern wanes","story":"New Zealand has announced a phased reopening of its border that has been largely closed for two years due to the Covid-19 pandemic as the government has tried to keep coronavirus out. Video: ReutersNew Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said ‘it’s time to move on’. Photograph: Dean PurcellNew Zealand Herald via APJacinda Ardern said New Zealand would gradually reopen its borders to citizens, workers and international travellers a week after a poll revealed that support for her as prime minister has dropped to the lowest level since she was elected in 2017.New Zealand adopted one of the strictest border policies in the world to stop the spread of Covid-19. The approach proved popular in the early days of the pandemic, but patience has worn thin after a planned border reopening in January was delayed because of the emergence of the highly infectious Omicron strain.A 1 News Kantar poll showed support for Ms Ardern as leader had declined to 35 per cent, though it remained well above Christopher Luxon, the leader of the opposition, at 17 per cent. The poll also revealed a sharp drop in confidence about the country’s economic outlook, with almost half of those surveyed now pessimistic.Phased reopeningNew Zealand will allow vaccinated citizens based in Australia to return from February 27th and has dropped quarantine restrictions in favour of self-isolation and rapid antigen testing. It will phase in arrivals for its citizens in other countries, skilled workers and students over the following weeks and months, with a full reopening to non-citizens in October.“It’s time to move on,” Ms Ardern said on Thursday, adding that the gradual approach would allow more New Zealanders to receive boosters to protect against Omicron. Positive cases are running at about 140 a day.Ian Taylor, chief executive of Animation Research, a Dunedin-based graphics company that works with media groups for sporting events, said some businesses had started to move operations offshore out of frustration with the sealed borders.He added that refusing to allow citizens to return to New Zealand was an even bigger problem, as some families with young children had been separated for two years.“As a country, we keep talking about leading the world in keeping our people safe,” said Mr Taylor. “But we also lead the word in having our citizens stranded overseas. That’s criminal.”Ms Ardern tightened restrictions within New Zealand last month and delayed her wedding after the first cases of Omicron were detected in the country.Kevin Ward, chief executive of the NZ Airports Association, called on the government to reconsider whether self-isolation was still appropriate, with a growing number of countries allowing quarantine-free travel.He said that demand from Australian tourists – excluding those visiting family – was estimated at only 7 per cent of 2019 levels this year.“Expecting self-isolation to still be required for travel to New Zealand later this year when the trans-Tasman market reopens makes no sense,” he said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"statism not route levelling","story":"Visitors to Florence will have seen the six-ball emblem of the Medicis dotted around the city, attached to buildings financed by the family’s considerable fortune. Michael Gove alluded to this example of self-publicising 14th-century paternalism in his announcement yesterday of the Government’s “levelling up” proposals. The idea is that by bringing together innovators in one place, the Medicis unwittingly instigated the Renaissance.Mr Gove believes that by applying a similar model in England, left-behind parts of the country can be brought up to up to the standards of living seen in more prosperous regions. Boris Johnson, will also hope that investment directed towards these areas will be similarly badged to leave no doubt in the so-called Red Wall constituencies as to its provenance. Levelling up is the Prime Minister’s Big Idea for the parliament, but showing voters the benefits before the next election scheduled for 2024 will be a difficult task.Attracting entrepreneurs, businesses, arts venues, good schools, effective transport and the rest to areas that have hitherto struggled is clearly to be commended. The issue is how to do it. Top-down dispensation of taxpayers’ largesse to regions that for decades have relied disproportionately on the public sector for jobs is not the answer, although yet more public money was Labour’s demand, as it always is.The plan comprises a dozen pledges enshrined in statute to be achieved by 2030, with targets to reach certain benchmarks for improving outcomes. The political architecture to bring this about will involve greater devolution and the appointment of regional mayors with the powers to drive the agenda. As a former mayor, Mr Johnson clearly sees merit in this approach provided the right person is in charge. A mayor can act as a barrier to investment and development by pursuing anti-business policies. In London, and soon in Manchester and Bradford, “green” motoring charges are more likely to drive commerce away, not encourage it.The analysis of the UK as top-heavy is correct: London and the South East have a greater dominance in this country than almost anywhere else. But this is a function of the decline of manufacturing and the rise of services, not of state interventionism. If there is to be a renaissance in the regions they need competitive tax policies, freeports, deregulation and less, not more, government.More from NewsChristian Democratic Party will \u0026#39get rid of itself\u0026#39 if it gets rid of \u0026#39Christian\u0026#39, critics warn  Friday evening UK news briefing: How Boris Johnson froze out his trusted advisersIn their haste to decolonise the curriculum, academics have overlooked the value of military historyPolitics latest news: Tory MP Aaron Bell - who asked PM \u0026#39Do you think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 - submits letter of no confidenceLord Ahmed: Victim calls for disgraced peer to be stripped of titleUniversity fat cats have abandoned studentsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"man exploited slave kept 40 years given 18 month suspended sentence","story":"A man who exploited a slave who was found living in a squalid shed has walked free from court.On Friday, Peter Swailes Jr was sentenced to a nine-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, at Carlisle Crown Court.The victim had been used and abused for 40 years by the defendant\u0027s father Peter Swailes Snr, the court heard. He was made to live in a horse box, a disused caravan and more recently in a shed on a residential site in Carlisle.It is thought to be the first case in legal history in England and Wales in which a victim of modern slavery gave pre-recorded evidence in order to spare someone vulnerable from the problems and trauma of a court appearance.Swailes\u0027 victim gave evidence in 2018 and 2019, three years before the trial, as part the investigation and preparation of the case.The Crown accepted the defendant\u0027s guilty plea last month to conspire to arrange or facilitate the travel of another with a view to exploitation on the basis that he was unaware of the victim\u0027s living conditions.Peter Swailes, 80, who died last year, had denied the offence.He lived on the same site as Mr Swailes Sr. He had various accommodations, including a horse box, an old caravan, and in the last five years or so, and during this offending, the shed that we have heard so much about.The court will be aware that he lived in the shed next to the chalet of Mr Swailes, with no heating, no lighting and no flooring. In stark contrast, the family dog lived in much more comfortable surroundings.Ms Webster said the victim had a low IQ and very little understanding of the world around him.She added: He was found by the police living in a rotten shed, with water pouring through it, with a makeshift bed, and congealed vomit in the corner – not the way that anyone would choose freely to live, and not where he would be if he could have found himself better living accommodation.He had few possessions to show for his 40 years hard work. He only had a wash bag, three second-hand coats, a few stained duvets and CDs.The man lived with the Swailes family for many years after being in care as a child, with Swailes Snr telling him that he was his boss.When he was not being made to work, Swailes Snr would order him to do chores such as painting the kitchen and cutting the grass.In a nearby similar-sized shed to the victim\u0027s accommodation, there was a fitted carpet, a light, a gas heater and the family dog.When officers attended the traveller site in October 2018, the victim told them he only received £10 a day for his work duties.Under the plea deal, the prosecution accepted that 56-year-old Swailes Jr was under the coercive control of Swailes Sr.Sentencing the father-of-five to a nine-month jail term, suspended for 18 months, he said he took into account a pre-sentence report, which assessed Swailes Jr as posing a very low risk of reoffending, and also his personal mitigation, including his poor health.More from NewsChristian Democratic Party will \u0026#39get rid of itself\u0026#39 if it gets rid of \u0026#39Christian\u0026#39, critics warn  Friday evening UK news briefing: How Boris Johnson froze out his trusted advisersIn their haste to decolonise the curriculum, academics have overlooked the value of military historyPolitics latest news: Tory MP Aaron Bell - who asked PM \u0026#39Do you think I\u0026#39m a fool?\u0026#39 - submits letter of no confidenceLord Ahmed: Victim calls for disgraced peer to be stripped of titleMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont believe word it levelling","story":"Dont believe a word of it, levelling up and metro mayors are just more Tory trickeryAs Andy Burnham found out during the pandemic, Westminster still rules, says Paul Routledge, and we should not fall for this fake devolutionManchester Mayor Andy Burnham Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Feb |comments The real motive of Tory “ levelling up ” is now clear.It’s not about shting prosperity from the wealthy South to disadvantaged towns and cities in England. It’s about taking back political control from local councils through metro mayors imposed by Whitehall. Nobody has asked for this revolution in local government – indeed, when asked, people voted against it.But the Tories ploughed ahead, and they intend to accelerate the process.The price for giving back half the money they’ve taken away from councils since  is to demand directly elected regional bosses. They think they can win those elections with candidates like ambitious, loud-mouthed Ben Houchen, mayor of the traditionally Labour area, Teesside. mayors have limited powers over transport and suchlike, but as Manchester’s Andy Burnham found during the pandemic, they are largely illusory.

Levelling up is a classic Conservative trick, to wrest back and retain control over millions of voters in provincial England. Scotland and Wales chose their own form of devolution. They don’t need or want these newfangled regional gaffers. The trick won’t work there.mayors are fake devolution. They get saddled with responsibility for things like buses they haven’t the money to put right, but no real powers to make le better for the people they are supposed to represent. Don’t be fooled. Kidsapos jabs going missing The understandable fixation with jabs for Covid has unwelcome side effects. The number of children having vaccinations against measles has dropped off, leaving one in  new kids in school without protection. Health chiefs fear an outbreak of this highly infectious, potentially deadly diseasethey’re not inoculated. This grim news comes as the Government does a screeching U-turn on mandatory Covid jabs for all NHS staff, on pain of dismissal. On balance, this is the right thing to do.

Aaron Bell MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme said Boris Johnsonaposs position is “untenable” as partygate has created a “breach of trust. Mr Bell, who was elected in , said he wrote his letter on January , after the PM apologised in the Commons for attending a Downing Street lockdown party. He has since struggled to square the Prime Ministeraposs words from the despatch box with his previous statements to the house before Christmas. Mr Johnson apologised in the Commons and told MPs: When I went into that garden just after six on  May , to thank groups of staff before going back into my office  minutes later to continue working, I believed implicitly that this was a work event.  But Mr Bell clearly was still struggling to make sense of his own personal grief as this week he expressed the dficulty of attending his grandmotheraposs funeral without being able to hug his parents or siblings.Mr Bell told MPs: I didn’t hug my siblings, I didn’t hug my parents, I gave the eulogy and then afterwards I didn’t even go to her house for a cup of tea. I drove back three hours from Kent to Staffordshire. Does the Prime Minister think I’m a fool ” The Prime Minister struggled to respond to his question and said: No Mr Speaker and I want to thank my honourable friend and say how deeply I sympathise with him and his family for their loss. Iaposm sorry for the judgments made by me or No  and I ask him respectfully to look at what Sue Gray has said and also respectfully to wait for the report. The Prime Minister faces a drip, drip of disillusioned Tory MPs calling for him to quit until Scotland Yard has completed its aposPartygateapos probe. Three more Tories have submitted letters of no confidence in Mr Johnson earlier this week - in just one day. It means the number of letters required to trigger a no confidence vote is creeping up towards the  threshold. On Wednesday three Tory MPs expressed their lack of confidence in the PM and called for him to go. If things could not get any worse on Thursday, Mr Johnson lost his most loyal aide who struggled to understand why he didnapost apologise for accusing Keir Starmer of not prosecuting Jimmy Savile - a  accusation.

Mandy Allwood made international headlines  years ago when she announced she was excepting octuplets.Tragically at  weeks, Mandy gave birth to six boys and two girls over three days and three nights - but none of the babies survived.She was personally comforted by Princess Diana at the time.Mandy went on to have three children but never recovered from the trauma of losing her eight babies. She said she experienced phantom pregnancies, where she claims she could still feel her babies kicking. She later split from her partner Paul Hudson. Mandy was arrested in November  for driving while three times the drink-drive limit while she had all three of her children in her car. She then lost custody of her kids and became estranged from her family. Now on Friday morning, Mandy will be cremated in a service funded by her local council with no mourners present. Her close family told The Sun that they would not be attending.Mandy’s friend, Mark Beard, , said told The Sun : “She had been struggling with cancer for a while and had an operation before Christmas but told us recently that it had come back. I don’t know what sort of cancer it was.”Mark, who is the landlord of the Yard of Ale pub in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warks, said Mandy would pop in two times a week.  He said: “She blended in really well and was always up for a chat. She was a bit eccentric and nutty but that’s why we loved her. Mark said about a dozen of Mandy’s pals were raising a glass for her tonight. Mandy named her lost octuplets Kypros, Adam, Martyn, Cassius, Nelson, Donald, Kitali and Layne, and they were all laid to rest in tiny white coffins. In , she told The Sun: Ever since I gave birth I have felt them kicking and moving every day. The feeling comes especially under my breastbone, it is like a sharp stabbing pain. I can feel it now as I’m talking.  Speaking in  she talked about how Princess Diana had reached out to her. The pair then met several times in London hotels where the Royal offered her support.

Little did Phil, who smoked for decades, know that the bizarre moment was in fact a sign that he had advanced cancer and without surgery had just months to live. He was aged  when he was forced to have invasive surgery, with doctors slicing into his face to remove the huge cancerous lump, reported the Manchester Evening News.He was told by doctors he had to have the surgery or he would be dead within six months.  In order to repair his damaged cheek, a surgeon had to remove part of Philaposs hip bone and move it into his face, leaving him unable to smile. The dad from Middleton, Greater Manchester, who had smoked since a teenager, realised something was wrong when he took a drink of water and it spurted out of his nose. “I started smoking at school when I was around  or  as everyone smoked back then, he said. I never thought about how it was affecting my health as I wasn’t a heavy smoker, I only smoked a few a day.  “I continued smoking for years and then in , I was drinking water and some of it came out of my nose. I knew something wasn’t right, so I went to get help. “I was referred to see a specialist at the dental hospital, who told me I had cancer and that it was serious, and I needed to have an urgent MRI scan and biopsy. A week later I was diagnosed with Stage mouth cancer and the doctor told me I had a choice – to decide to have the operation within a month or die. He said I could have six months to live and maybe see Christmas. I had to quit smoking immediately.  “I’ll never forget the surgeon telling me how serious it was, the tumour was in my cheek bone, and he thought it had been hidden for four years. It was the size of a tennis ball and had to be removed. It was a massive operation, and it took me months to recover.” A team of surgeons operated on Phil for over  hours. They cut his face in half and removed his cheek bone, eye and palate. Part of his hip bone was then used to replace the removed part and reconstruct his face.He couldn’t talk or eat properly for six months and he was also left slightly disfigured as the nerves in his face were damaged during surgery.“It looks like I’ve had a tiny stroke, but I have been incredibly lucky as not everyone makes it through, Phil continued. The medical team manged to remove the entire tumour, so I didn’t have to have chemotherapy or radiotherapy. “In October , I had a face lt which has given me much more confidence and I only have a faint scar now. One of the biggest challenges was learning to eat and talk just using my left-hand side of my face, as I have no teeth on the other side. I’ve now been in remission for just over three years, and I have never felt better.”  Phil has since been able toto his job in highways maintenance. Since quitting smoking he says he sleeps better, no longer feels out of breath and had more energy. He added: My taste improved and I also started to save money, all of these were incentives to stop smoking but being diagnosed with cancer was definitely my wake-up call as I would have continued smoking. I needed the shock of being diagnosed with stage  cancer to stop, and I urge everyone to give quitting a go before you end up like me.” Phil is sharing his story ahead of World Cancer Day on Friday. Smoking is directly linked to at least  dferent forms of cancer, and causes % of all cancer cases each year in the UK , according to Cancer Research UK. Dr Matt Evison, Clinical Lead for Greater Manchester’s tobacco control programme Make Smoking History, said: “Quitting smoking is the best thing you can do for your health, and to reduce your risk of developing serious illnesses. “I see the harm from smoking daily and the devastation it causes patients and their families. It damages every organ in the body and causes lung disease, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and at least  types of cancer.

Two children armed with blades began fighting on the  bus in Streatham at around .pm, as fellow passengers filmed the incident.Passengers watched on in terror as the teenage boys wielded the knives like swords, My London reported. One person claimed that the fight went on for five minutes, with the footage showing a man standing by the boys appearing to attempt to calm the situation down. The smaller teenager, who has a mask obscuring the lower part of his face, seems to almost lose hold of his blade as the other strikes it with his own. On a clip that has been widely shared on social media, a caption reads: Asthis just happened. Kids with a kne on the bus in Streatham. They have gone after about five minutes of back and forth. Social media users commented on how terried the passenger looks while attempting to deescalate the situation. The poor guy at front standing up.. terried, one person said. Another remarked on how frightening it must have been for the passenger, saying: That poor man there to the left, must have been frightening. By the time police arrived on the scene, all those involved had fled. There were no reported injuries and no arrests, but the policeaposs enquiries continue. A spokesperson for the Met said: Police were called at :hrs on Thursday,  February to reports of a fight on board a bus in the area of Telford Avenue, SW.

As she has no extra money, she will need to ration the heating and avoid turning it on every dayAmanda Buttons gas bill is going up from £ to £ a monthByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistMaryam QaiserFeatures Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments In Amanda Button’s home, the heating only goes on for one to two hours on very cold days. After yesterday’s announcement that  million households will face record increases to energy bills, she will ration it further.“I’ve already been told my gas is going up from £ to £ a month,” she says. “There’s no extra money so I will just have to put the heating on every two to three days now. I already wear my coat, scarf and gloves inside for some of the day.” Amanda is disabled following a car accident in , and she was lucky to survive. The cold causes her pain. “I even know when the cold is coming,” she says. But she has already cut back on everything .“Food is already more expensive so it’s hard to save money there, and I recently lost the £ uplt to Universal Credit. I haven’t had takeaways or holidays for years.” Liza Bradbury, , a healthcare rehabilitation worker from Grimsby, Lincs, bought her teenage sons fleece bedding and pyjamas as their Christmas presents so she could turn her heating down. “I use a community shop for low-price food, and I’ve been trying to change my job because my journey to Hull costs money each day,” she says. In Coventry, shop worker Claire Cunningham, , lives with her disabled dad and her four children. “Sometimes it feels like I am choosing to keep the house warm, keep the lights on, and make fresh, healthy food for my children,” she says. “I make sure I get the food shopping first, and I’m left with very little money at the end. It is so scary. I am drained, I’m having sleepless nights, we don’t do anything as a family any more. The electricity is my biggest worry.” After two years withstanding the economic and emotional pain of Covid, households were hit with a % increase yesterday to the energy price cap. The same day as Shell – cashing in on those rocketing markets – posted  profits of £.billion, making the moral and economic case for Labour’s proposed windfall tax.  Coming at the exact same moment as an interest rate rise, a VAT increase and soaring food prices, this is a Molotov cocktail of price hikes for ordinary families. For those on prepayment meters like Amanda, the price cap will rise from £, to £, – an increase of £. Millions more will pay an extra £ a year on their energy bills from April, Ofgem has said. In low-income households, fuel already makes up far more of the bills total. Everything except essentials is already pared back to the bare minimum. Tracey Herrington, a project manager at Thrive Teesside, which supports low-income communities to bring about change, puts it simply. “There’s nothing left to give,” she says. “People in our community are already choosing between heating and eating. They are already sitting in blankets at home. There’s a fuel crisis, food prices crisis, National Insurance crisis. How many crises can you have  People can’t even afford the bus fare to get to the foodbank or somewhere warm that can help them. It’s desperation.  “These are scary times. We’re going to see an upsurge in mental health problems as people get even more isolated. We’ll see social anxiety, and yes, malnutrition.” She sounds tired and frustrated. “We knew this was coming,” she says. “We knew.” Launching a support package worth £ per person, the Chancellor was keen to talk about the global causes of the cost of living crisis yesterday – last year’s cold winter, the lack of wind. But these “leaves on the line” excuses belie a series of heartless decisions by the Government.It was Rishi Sunak who chose to end the uplt to Universal Credit. It was Sunak who will increase VAT. It was his government that has failed to regulate the energy market or to hold gas in reserve. It was his government who allowed Shell’s £.billion profits slide without a windfall tax, while the French government yesterday announced it would tax energy €.billion to cover the increase in price rises. It’s the Tories who have written off £billion in PPE contracts and £.billion in Covid loan fraud that could have cancelled the VAT hike. The cost of living crisis has been thundering down the track while the Government has been mired in Partygate. The Prime Minister has been fiddling the rules while Rome burns.As Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves told Sunak yesterday in the Commons: “The Conservatives aren’t solving the cost of living crisis because the Conservative Party are the cost of living crisis.” National Energy Action CEO Adam Scorer says the Government failed their “exam question” – “How to protect the most vulnerable from a devastating rise in the cost of energy”.Amanda Button was as unimpressed as Reeves by Sunak’s rescue plan of £ to be clawed back over five years. “What the Chancellor’s offering is, I’m sorry, it’s a drop in the ocean,” she says. “As for Boris Johnson, don’t even start me on him.” As we approach the second anniversary of the coronavirus lockdown, communities have been holding on, often by their fingernails, for two years. Only to find that economically, there was worse to come.Yesterday Citizens Advice issued a “red alert” on rising costs. That was before the Bank of England announced a second back-to-back rise in interest rates in  months. One that it warned could lead to the biggest fall in living standards since comparable records began three decades ago.  Foodbank volunteer Michael Drinan, , from London, puts it this way. “The system is broken, and the Government doesn’t have a clue,” he says. “The price hikes will affect the lowest working people, not the Sunaks of the world.” With prices outstripping wage rises and a National Insurance raid to come in April, families are now facing a squeeze greater than during the financial crisis, while the oil giants get richer, and the Tories look increasingly out of touch.

She has already been forced to pay out £, on ious safety measures, including hiring workers to act as a aposwaking watchapos for fires. The health worker and her neighbours have now received huge bills for the upcoming removal of timber cladding on their block of flats. Although they do not have to pay immediately, the charge sent a shot of apospanicapos through the leaseholders in Timble Beck building.  Rachael, who bought her two-bed flat in , told The Mirror: When I got the bill on Monday I just went cold. It induced panic in everyone in the building. We have lived in fear of it for some time, itaposs draining to live like this all the time. We are completely trapped. There are people living here with children who want to move to have a garden but they canapost. Thereaposs one couple who want to get orced but they havenapost been able to make that separation as they canapost split their assets.  If we say aposno we wonapost payapos they can repossess our homes and we would still be liable for the costs of the work. Itaposs feudal the way they can make us pay. I would have had more protection in lawI bought a toaster - I would have had consumer rights. Rachael has already spent £k on safety measures, such as the aposwaking watchapos and a fire alarm system, since January . She was able to find the cash to cover the £k, however some of her neighbours are still paying it off in monthly instalments.  The buildingaposs management firm Centrick has now handed Rachael a £, bill for upcoming work. Rachael said the project will install fire breaks and remove the following: flammable insulation, polycarbonate material in the stairwell and timber cladding, soffits and balconies. She said: I think sending out the bills was a bullying thing, they are hoping that because these are in our names... it will be a way of cowering us into paying. Rachael hopes that some of the cost -not all - will be covered by the Government after an application was made for more than £million to the Building Safety Fund on behalf of residents. My share would be £,. We think we will get some of it but we donapost knowit will be half or how much, she said. Rachael was charged £, for the application - on top of the £k she has already paid out.  Leaseholders at Timble Beck building were first hit with hefty bills after an aposadvice noteapos was issued following the fatal Grenfell Tower fire in . Rachael said: The fire service said itaposs two years since Grenfell and no-one has done anything. They thought the advice note would force freeholders to do an assessment but it led to freeholders saying wehad to pay. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service told Centrick it needed to introduce a aposwaking watchapos on the same day officers checked the building, the company previously said. This round-the-clock surveillance only came to an end when a fire alarm system was installed in the block, which is part of the Fearn Island Mills development. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Rachael bought her flat for £, in  but it is now officially worth £ because of the fire safety issues, she said. She added: It canapost be sold, borrowed against and I wouldnapost be able to release any equity to pay for the cladding bills until after the works are completed. A spokesman for Centrick said: We sympathise with leaseholders as this is a terrible situation which neither they nor Centrick have caused. Centrick have been actively taking steps, in line with Government guidance, to make sure that the building is made safe as quickly as possible, and that the correct measures have been put in place to try protect leaseholders from the costs. They added: An application has been made to the Government’s Building Safety Fund for the cost of remediating the combustible materials in the external walls of the building. Although we have sent bills to leaseholders showing the full estimated cost of the remediation work we also gave clear assurances, both prior to and with the bill, that the costs for the works do not need to be paid at this time pending the outcome of the funding application. These charges are separated and clearly identiable from the usual service charges on the bill so that it is clear what payments are due now. Any funds that are received from a successful application will be credited to the service charge funds and leaseholdersapos accounts will be adjusted accordingly. The spokesman said leaseholders in the building had to pay for the aposwaking watchapos as it was not possible to claim the cash back from the Government.

Image: mediadrumAndrewCrowleyBySam Elliott-GibbsReporterChloe Shakesby:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments A newly-married couple bought a double decker bus online after a sinking a few glasses of wine - and transformed it into an incredible dream home complete with a log fire.Gareth and Lamorna Hollingsworth met when they were both travelling abroad and quickly fell in love.But the adventures and road trips are just beginning thanks to the Hereford coupleaposs spur-of-the-moment eBay buy.In , the couple got married and went on a year-long honeymoon travelling the world in a camper van. But when they got back, they realised that they didn’t want to stop hitting the road together - so they logged on and bought a  double-decker Scania bus for £,. “On ourfrom a truly epic honeymoon, talk turned quickly to the idea of buying a larger van and seeing more of Europe,” said Gareth, . “Talk of vans quickly became talk of buses, and before long - and after a couple of glasses of wine - we bought a double-decker on eBay. “I’ve always wanted to build a house, and the bus was a step in the right direction. “Not an easy one,it was, everyone would be doing it, but we like a challenge. And a challenge it has been, but one that will be worth all the effort. “Think of it as a tiny home, as opposed to a camper van. We chose a bus because we wanted enough space to live in comfortably, but with the ability to move.  “It was also important to us to be completely self-sufficient. Our solar setup gives us nearly four kilowatts of battery storage, enough for almost a weekaposs usage.” Gareth and Lamorna, , have spent nearly two years working on the bus, spending an estimated total of £, on the project. That including purchasing the bus for £,, and another £, on solar power and batteries, and £, on getting the right driving licence. The renovation involved entirely stripping the bus of its old floors, ceilings, walls and radiators, adding in fresh ones - as well as a water tank to allow for everyday living.  The bottom floor of the bus contains a fully-ing kitchen, with a full-sized oven, sink, and fridge-freezer, as well as a slide-out pantry and overhead kitchen storage, plus a log fire to keep the double-decker warm, and of course, a composting toilet and shower. Upstairs is a multi-al office and lounge area, plus a double bed and purpose-built wardrobes, with solar  on the roof. “Every job takes longer than you think,” said Gareth. “Nothing is square, nothing is level, every wall is curved and you can say goodbye to a spirit level as the bus isn’t parked on level ground.  “We have repurposed where possible, recycled, shopped around online and done all the work ourselves to keep to budget.They now document their journey on their Instagram account @we_bought_a_double_decker.Gareth and Lamorna are currently living in a trailer next to the bus along with their dog Maya, who will be joining them on their double-decker journey. “We wouldnapost be without Maya now, evenshe brings muddy paw prints into the bus,” said Gareth. “We will actually have more room in the bus when we move in soon. Every aspect has been painstakingly thought through to the smallest detail.  “Space is a premium, and we have to really think outside the box to ensure we make the most of it. “For instance, rather than just having a door to our bedroom, instead we have built a bookcase which doubles up as the door, opening on secret hinges by pulling the right book.” The pair get ‘itchy’they spend too long without travelling, and are looking forward to getting back out on the road. The eventual plan is to settle down in Spain or Portugal, but for now, they’re simply excited to get going. “Most people are either envious or think weaposre mad. There are so many issues with driving double-deckers - but the challenge is part of the fun,” said Gareth. “So many people feel stuck with large mortgages or unsatisfactory jobs. “We will be mortgage-free, have a house on wheels, and be free to see the world and enjoy its delights.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Public transportproperty news\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But the minimum wage worker was then apospressuredapos into reducing her hours as the coronavirus pandemic hit before being made redundant in a shock move. The Manchester tribunal heard how the minimum wage worker was then pressured into reducing her hours before being made redundant. The tribunal ruled that bosses at the nursery, located in Hoddlesden, Lancashire, had dressed up her sacking with a sham process because she was having a child. Darci has since welcomed son Stanley and will be compensated after suing for pregnancy discrimination and unfair dismissal. The tribunal report said: A few days later, in the course of a discussion about her pregnancy, Ms Costello told her that Julie Mercer, the owner of the nursery, would aposcome round to itapos, and she mentioned the fact that Miss Topping was on probation. Other comments were made, including questions about whether Miss Topping was, in fact, going to keep the baby and whether that would be a good idea, and reference was made to Miss Toppingaposs partner or father of the baby at the time. Stepping Stones Nursery became worried about finances as the reality of Covid hit, with Darciaposs hours cut to  a week without consultation. She was forced to sign a hastily typed up document agreeing to cutting her hours - but was the only worker to have her shts formally cut. Darci was anxious over the pandemicaposs impact on her health and whether or not she would have a job, the tribunal heard. She was placed on sick leave initially but then placed on furlough as well as other members of staff.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  However, she was the only one to receive % of wages for  hours a week, rather than . And despite things being stable at the nursery, she was made redundant out of the blue while on furlough, leaving her very upset. Ms Costello even suggested she might be better off on benefits during the telephone call. The report said: By April , , the numbers of children attending the nursery each day had stabilised. Miss Topping was by then on furlough with other employees at no cost to the nursery. What happened then was that Ms Costello simply rang up Miss Topping and announced her dismissal as . From the evidence presented, the Tribunal considered that the nursery dressed up her dismissal by constructing a redundancy process which either never took place or took place after the nursery made its decision to dismiss her. Darci launched legal action, claiming the nursery had a problem with pregnant employees. Employment Judge Marion Batten said: The Tribunal concluded that the decision to make her redundant was a decision targeted at her alone – she was pregnant and in light of the paucity of the evidence, it was apparent that was the only dference. There was no other credible explanation offered by the nursery. The Tribunal had no hesitation in concluding that her dismissal was related to her pregnancy. Only she was dismissed. She was the only employee who was pregnant, and in the context of her treatment by the nursery since she told them, at the beginning of March , that she was pregnant. Following the case, Darci said she is glad to have won the tribunal. She added: It was very tough for me being made redundant at such a vulnerable point in my le while expecting my first baby which I wanted to be excited about. I do feel that I have got justice and I am relieved that the case is finally over. A compensation hearing will take place later this month.

Guests at the glitzy bash, thrown by a Libyan businessman in the south of France, saw the Prince, then , cavort with the -year-old. The pair were playfully pictured dancing the night away after being introduced by artist Jeffery Dread.Images from the encounter have resurfaced as Andrew fights for his future after being told he must face a civil trial on allegations he ­sexually abused Virginia Giuffre when she was . He denies the accusations.  Andrew was pictured partying at the millionaireaposs playground  years ago.But the Evening Standard claim she was dating Prince Albert of Monacoaposs right-hand-man Bruno Philipponnat at the time.Mr Dread said at the time: Andrew came over to me and asked, aposWhataposs her name  She is beautul. I love the way she carries herself, she is very classyapos - Iaposd known Chris for years and I was the one who took her to the party. The dancefloor was by the swimming pool and there were many beautul girls flocking to Andrew, but he was completely focused on Chris.  I felt it was not my business to say she was dating someone  and she danced with Andrew for most of the evening until the party ended at about am. He followed her everywhere she went, even to the bathroom, and at one point he gave her a head massage. But despite getting closer, her friend was quick to insist the socialite went home with her friends that night. Three years ago, it was reported she got into real trouble over the pictures of her with royal that night. But her long-time friend Richard Gradner said nothing should be read into at the party. These photos of her with Prince Andrew do not show Chrisapos true character, he said. If she was into partying, she has cleaned up her act greatly since those days and taken a dferent path. But one former regular on the Saint Tropez party scene said the Prince was properly letting his hair down after his freedom was confirmed: These were really crazy years for Andrew. He was clearly having a full-blown midle crisis, the partygoer is quoted as saying. He would have been  or  at the time, orced from Sarah Ferguson, and basking in the attention he got from young women.

The Duke of Sussex - who has signed several multi-million pound deals since quitting the Royal Family - said he still has hard days but is schooled by the universe.During a chat with US company BetterUp, the -year-old said all employees should be given time to build their mental fitness. Harry was able to take five months off when his daughter Lilibet was born last year. He wants to see bosses allocating -minute white space breaks each day for staff to relax, while admitting: I too experience burn-out.  Iaposm burning the candle at both ends and thataposs like, boom. Harry advocates meditating every day, and said he is able to schedule around half an hour or  minutes for it while son Archie is at school.Despite sharing an £million mansion in Santa Barbara, Calorniaaposs lavish Montecito community with we Meghan Markle, the Duke says he still misses out on things he would love to do. This is due to the stresses he faces. I know I need to meditate every single day, he said. Harry likes to take a lesson from anything negative, which helps him be more resilient to leaposs challenges.  Some days are great, some days are really hard, he said. Iaposm always kicking myself - aposIf youaposd have done this, which you know works for you, you wouldnapost be in this state now.apos Itaposs work, but of all the work thataposs pulled towards us, itaposs the most fulfilling work - apart from being a dad, he added. It comes after a royal expert said Harry is laying low for now and doesnapost want to cause any more upset for his family back in Britain.Since stepping down as a senior working royal and moving to America with Meghan, Harry has made several claims against his family.In March last year, he and Meghan sat down for a bombshell chat with Oprah Winfrey, where they alleged there had been conversations about how dark their son Archieaposs skin would be before he was born. Harry also revealed a rt between him and his brother, Prince William and he told how he felt really let down by his father, Prince Charles, and had been cut off financially by the royals.He also lashed out at Charles on the Armchair Expert podcast and the Apple series The Me You Canapost See.But with Harryaposs beloved grandmother the Queen suffering health issues last year and her Platinum Jubilee celebrations coming up, royal expert Katie Nicholl says he will try to keep things calmer. Katie told Closer magazine : Whether Harry has regrets or not, I don’t know, but what I do know is that he has a history of lashing out at the establishment before. He’s talked about his aposaccident of birthapos and the aposburden of the crownapos.He’s been critical in the past, but then goes quiet. I think since last year he’s paused and reflected. And he’s realised how much last year took a toll on his grandmother, and doesn’t want to cause any more upset, so is laying low for now.

The year one pupil carefully drew and coloured in the pretend test with felt tip and presented it to her mum on Thursday in the hope she would get to have a duvet day.But her artistic endeavours failed to pull the wool over the marketing workeraposs eyes and Una was marched to school as usual.Emma, from Rainham, Kent, said: Summer didnapost feel well so she had to take a test so we can let the school knowitaposs Covid.  Una was jealous her sister was getting to stay home. It always happens,one is off then the other gets jealous. The mum told how she was trying to get Una ready for school while asking Summer to do a test. As I was getting Unaaposs lunch ready and getting her out the door, Una was there with this test drawn on a piece of paper saying she couldnapost go to school, she said. Sheaposs pretty cheeky and she thought I would fall for it. She does sneaky things to get out of school but this is the funniest one. I thought it was funny and quite genius.  Despite Unaaposs efforts, Emma did not fall for the hoax and she was packed off to school. Emma said: She got a bit upset and said it wasnapost fair but I told her sheaposd rather be well and at school than unwell and at home. I do have trouble getting her to school and the teacher practically had to pull her inside but sheaposs fine when sheaposs in there. She would rather spend time at home with me because I work from home so she thinks itaposs unfair. Sheaposs a mummyaposs girl, she wants to spend as much time with me as possible. Emma recalled telling her daughter that it did not look like a positive test but the youngster insisted it was unfair. If she had done it properly, she would have drawn a line on a real lateral flow but I wonapost tell her that because thataposll be the next thing, she added. The mum-of-two admits she made similar attempts to ditch school as a child and found Unaaposs effort so funny she shared it on social media. The post had readers in giggles and racked up more than  interactions with some people sharing their own brazen attempts to bunk off school years ago.  One commentor said: Genius. My five-year-old has gone from screaming blue murder at PCR tests to asking to take a LFT herself because her nine-year-old brother has been off with positive results and she wants a positive so she can stay home too. Another wrote: As a kid I covered my face in talc and faked feeling unwell..... Mum fell for it. I was pulling a blinder, lying on the sofa all day watching TV, pretending to feel sorry for myself when suddenly the dutul mum swooped in for a kiss, only to smell the talc on my cheek. I never regretted something so much as I did in that moment. Emma said people praised her as being a legend and some thought back to the ideas they had when they were younger. She said: When I was younger, I would put my head on the radiator so that my mum would think I had a temperature but sheaposd always know because sheaposd see the line from the radiator on my head. Itaposs typical of her. She goes out of her way to get her own way by any means possible and sheaposs really cheeky.

In her second year of Aerospace Engineering at Leeds University, Jessica found herself struggling to take part in her studies.After a le-saving trip to the doctors, she was stunned to discover that her excessive napping and fatigue were a symptom of chronic myeloid leukaemia.Now, one year on, Jessica is in remission and back in university. Jessica said: I’ve never been a tired person so it was strange for me. Every night, I was sleeping for up to  hours, waking up for only two hours and then having a three-hour nap.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here “I’m a vegetarian, I just assumed I had anaemia or maybe lacking vitamin B – I never would have thought it was something so serious. “I went for a blood test and they phoned me the next day to tell me my white blood count was  times what it should have been. “I was told that I had chronic myeloid leukaemia and it was in the blast stage which is the most aggressive. After her shocking diagnosis, Jess had to stay in hospital for five months whilst undergoing two rounds of chemotherapy. She adds: “I didn’t know how to feel, it was too much to take in. “I felt so much frustration because I had to defer uni for the year and I was stuck in a hospital room so I missed out on a lot.apos She was forced to temporarily quit her studies as she underwent aggressive treatment including a stem cell transplant from her own mum, Kerry Mellor, . During treatment, she was only allowed to see her mum who could not visit her for more than an hour a day. She said: “There wasnapost a match for me on the donation register so my Mum donated even though she was only half a match. “This meant they had to filter out the cells that were a match - it was nice to know I could rely on someone like that. Whilst the transplant was a success and Jess is now on the mend, she still has to take oral chemotherapy daily and is forced to live alone as her low immunity is a risk to her le. She said: “My stem cell transplant means I have to live by myself which means my immunity is really low. “I had to remain shielded becauseI caught any type of virus, I could have died - there were no white blood cells in my body to protect me. Now Iaposm back at university, I have to live alone which people donapost really do at university and I have to watch the Covid levelI want to go outside - itaposs quite lonely. The treatment means my eyelashes and eyebrows are falling out which isnapost nice and affected my self-esteem. Jessica is now looking forward to the next academic year, where she will be allowed to live with her friends again. She said: I donapost know what I would have done without the support from aposYoung Lives vs Cancerapos and my support worker, Harriet Wainwright who has really helped me money wise and getting the help that I needed to carry on at university. She initially wanted to follow an engineering career path however, after her terrying experience, Jessica is thinking about taking her le in a new direction. Jessica said:The experience has changed my le and Iaposm unsureI want to still go down the path my degree is taking me. Currently, Iaposm volunteering with aposMarrowapos - the Anthony Nolan student network which encourages other students to donate stem cells. Rachel Kirby-Rider, Chief Executive at Young Lives vs Cancer said: “Going through cancer when you’re young is le-shattering, you have big plans and dreams and then cancer comes along and puts a line through it all.

Mandy made headlines around the world  years ago when she fell pregnant aged  in . Tragically at  weeks, Mandy gave birth to six boys and two girls over three days and three nights - but each of the babies died in a matter of hours. She went on to have three children but neighbours and friends said she never recovered from the trauma of losing her babies. Mandy will be cremated today at a service, with no friends or family present.  Mandy lived in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, and her neighbours said the area would be a much quieter place without her. They revealed how she battled booze demons which led to her accidentally flooding her property on several occasions One neighbour, who would only give her name as Sue, said she often helped Mandy when she could as she felt sorry for her. Sue added: I didnapost know her very well because she was a bit of a funny person, she was an alcoholic so she could be a bit in your face. I tried to give her what she needed and help. It was a shame, I felt sorry for her - but it was just too much to handle. It is a bit of a relief. She flooded the flat underneath her when she overfilled her bath. The guy in the flat below couldnapost do anything to stop it. She denied it and wasnapost very helpful - so she was a bit of a mixed character. Heaposs now got to get his flat sorted because she did it three times. It wasnapost that she did it intentionally, she was just so drunk. With this virus too she was constantly coming over to my house and hugging me, and I had to be nice with her but I even had to lock my doors. Once she just came into the flat, she was just so drunk she never knew what she was doing. I know it sounds awful, but itaposs lovely around here and now sheaposs gone itaposs a bit better. Mandyaposs home could be seen today covered in elaborate, chaotic and colourful decorations with her front door labelling her flat the manor. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: She was certainly a character to say the least, but she never recovered from what happened to her. You canapost even imagine the trauma she went through so its understandable I suppose but she did have her struggles with the bottle. It will certainly be quieter around here, she was rather eccentric. Despite her problems, she had a heart of gold. Mandy previously told how she spiralled into depression and suffered with suicidal thoughts in the years after her babies died in her arms.

Mandy said: She came to meet me when I was staying at the Ritz and the Dorchester in London. She was absolutely lovely. I never really got the chance to say thank you to her properly. She gave me a hug, showed me lots of support and told me she liked my dress. When we first met she said to me aposthank you for keeping me off the front pages for a changeapos - it was a massive boost for me. Mandy continued to mark the anniversaries of the death of her children - Kypros, Adam, Martyn, Cassius, Nelson, Donald, Kitali and Layne – by visiting their graves alone. She said: They are always in my mind and I think about them every single day. I have good days and bad days but Iaposm feeling a lot better. I feel happy and positive about the future. Giving advice to other women who had lost babies, she added: You will never ever forget your babies, but donapost be hard on yourself. You will never forget your little boy or girl but you canapost change it. Stay positive and it will work out.

She became the most famous mum-to-be after it was announced in  that she was expecting octuplets - and thousands grieved with her when it emerged she had lost them all. Mandy never recovered from the heartbreaking trauma and she still experienced phantom pregnancies two decades later. She was even comforted by Princess Diana after the unlikely pair formed a friendship and met - where they chatted about depression. She gave birth at  weeks to six boys and two girls over three days and three nights in  but none of the babies survived. She never recovered from the trauma of losing the octuplets, who she had named Mandy Kypros, Adam, Martyn, Cassius, Nelson, Donald, Kitali and Layne. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Controversial deal Mandy was a mum-of-one when she met Paul Hudson in . Desperate to have more children with him, after suffering a miscarriage, she took fertility drugs to boost her odds. The situation was complex, as Paul continued to spend two nights a week with his lover ex, with whom he had two kids. She was injected with two doses of din, designed to stimulate oies without medical supervision - but reportedly ignored advice not to have sex at a critical time in the treatment. Doctors advised her to reduce the number of embryos in order to give the foetuses a better chance of survival - but overjoyed Mandy was desperate to carry all eight babies.  Following her discovery that she was pregnant with octuplets, Mandy went on to hire now-disgraced PR guru Max Clford and signed TV and newspaper deals set to net her more millions This included a deal with the now-defunct News of the World - which the BBC reports allegedly included a controversial clause that must not abort any of the embryos -despite huge concerns for her health and that of her babies. She was reportedly offered £millionall eight babies were delivered safely. Suing Max Clford The controversial PR, later convicted of indecent assault, promised Mandy and Paul huge riches from her pregnancy - but she ended up suicidal and penniless after tragically losing her eight babies. After she fell pregnant, he moved her and Paul, from Solihull, West Mids, to a safe house in South London to stop her talking to other press - but hardly ever visited. And when she suffered her immense loss in early labour where she nearly died twice, she said Clford didnapost care. Instead after five days, she said he arranged for her to move to a hotel before she was flown to America for an interview with Oprah. And the mum was left fuming after an interview with a German TV station where they had reportedly offered Clford £, for her story but he told Mandy it was just £,. She later successfully sued him in  the High Court for making secret profits - and told the Sun she sold her soul to the devil by working with him. Princess Diana meeting Mandy revealed that Princess Diana got in touch with her just five weeks after she lost her children, and said they went on to meet twice. Speaking in  about their meetings, Mandy said the pair enjoyed crab and prawn lunches together in top London hotels. She said: She gave me a hug, showed me lots of support. When we first met she said to me, aposThank you for keeping me off the front pages for a changeapos. We talked about her depression and my panic attacks and she told me she had been there, too. We spoke about her family and she talked a lot about Charles and Camilla. Tragic deaths Mandy unexpectedly went into labour at  weeks, just weeks after the story had first broken. Recalling the nightmare in  in an exclusive interview with the Mirror, she said: I remember it like yesterday. I went to the toilet and as I stood up, the baby shot out on its cord, she says. This tiny baby, fully formed with all its fingernails. I was actually very calm. I got taken to hospital with a police escort and lost two more babies that day. Another was lodged in my back. Iaposve never known pain like it. Over the next two days, she lost her five other babies.She recalled: I looked at them dressed in their babygrows and all I could think of was which one could I have killed  How could I have chosen  I was distraught. When I left the hospital I was so low. It was scary to re-adjust and pick up the pieces in the real world. I just wanted to be on my own. Heartbreaking photos went on to capture the funeral where eight tiny coffins were carried into the church.  Family estrangement The mum didnapost think it would be possible to conceive after the horric trauma she endured but discovered she was pregnant again in  with daughter Colour. Just three months after giving birth, she discovered she was pregnant again and gave birth to daughter Kitali. And in , she gave birth to Rade, by emergency Caesarean at  weeks. The money made from media deals had largely disappeared and she was convicted for two counts of fraud in , after telling banks she was a high-powered executive while on income support. Depression still engulfed her and she told the papers how she tried to take her own le in . Mandy told The People: It was only when I woke in hospital and realised how lucky I was to be alive that I really started to deal with my grief. But she was caught driving three times over the limit while her kids were in the car in  and given an ASBO for playing loud music in , resulting in her losing custody. She battled alcohol addiction, money issues and suicidal thoughts until the end, and remained estranged from her family. Neighbours who lived by her said she never got over the loss. One said: She was certainly a character, to say the least, but she never recovered from what happened to her. You canapost even imagine the trauma she went through so itaposs understandable I suppose but she did have her struggles with the bottle. It will certainly be quieter around here, she was rather eccentric. Despite her problems, she had a heart of gold. Phantom pregnancies Heartbreakingly, Mandy continued to suffer from phantom pregnancies twenty years after her huge loss. She told The Sun: I will never ever be able to forget because I am always thinking about them in my head, but also because I can still feel my babies inside me constantly. Ever since I gave birth I have felt them kicking and moving every day.apos She said the feeling comes under her breastbone and feels like a apossharp stabbingapos. Itaposs horric because it brings back all the trauma every minute of every day when I feel the kicks,apos she added. aposI am sent back to the time of me giving birth Book hope Mandy started to face up to her grief and the other issues that she had plagued her during her le. She told a newspaper in : When I look at myself now and what Iaposve been through itaposs amazing that Iaposm still here. I have beaten anorexia and bulimia, had a failed marriage and a orce, lost my brother and been in dficult relationships. I fell out with my parents, had five miscarriages, suffered the loss of eight babies, had post-natal depression - how much can one person take My le has enough material for an entire series of the Jeremy Kyle Show.

The move will affect some  million households and follows a% rise in October . See how much your bills will be using our Cost of Living Calculator Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said: We know this rise will be extremely worrying for many people, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet, and Ofgem will ensure energy companies support their customers in any way they can. The energy market has faced a huge challenge due to the unprecedented increase in global gas prices - a once in a -year event - and Ofgemaposs role as energy regulator is to ensure that, under the price cap, energy companies can only charge a fair price based on the true cost of supplying electricity and gas. Ofgem is working to stabilise the market and over the longer term to ersy our sources of energy which will help protect customers from similar price shocks in the future. An announcement on theenergy price caphad been due next week but was brought forward to today.The price cap sets a limit on the rates a supplier can charge for each unit of gas and electricity you use and is reviewed twice a year. Gas prices around the world have climbed, owing to the pandemic. As a result of the prices of wholesale gas - which have quadrupled in the last year - suppliers are now passing on the cost to customers.  Several readers have shared their stories on how the new prices will affect them. Ofgem reviews its energy price cap twice a year. The next time it could change is in October, although this might be altered. While wholesale prices have eased, experts say October could bring another rise in the price cap, possibly to an average £, a year.To ‘take the sting’ out of the announcement, Rishi Sunak announced a one-off repayable £ discount and a rebate on council tax bills.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON OfgemEnergyCouncil taxEnergy billsGas prices\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Maurice Jewel Taylor Sr, , and Natalie Sumiko Brothwell, , have both been accused of two counts of murder following the deaths of Maurice Jr, , and Maliaka, , in Calornia, it is reported. They have also been charged of child abuse under circumstances or conditions likely to cause great bodily injury or death to two other children who were aged eight and nine at the time.The horric details have been confirmed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office with the older children decapitated and two younger boys shown their bodies, reported foxla.The two surviving siblings were then made to remain in their bedroom for several days without food.  The two dead children were kned on November , , and their bodies were found at their home in Lancaster, about  miles north of Los Angeles, it is reported.

Taylor was working as a physical therapy centre in Santa Monica and was carrying out training sessions online during the Covid pandemic.

They had been concerned about Taylor’s behaviour in the week beforehand and then the Los Angeles Times reported that clients contacted the fire department over a possible gas leak.Howard Kern, a client of Taylor’s told the newspaper: “I said, ‘I’m concerned’. “We are concerned about a possible gas leak. There are four children and two adults, we are concerned about their safety.” Kern added of Taylor: “Think of the nicest person that you know, then multiply that by five. “He worked so hard to support himself. Unfortunately, we don’t know enough to say what happened or what didn’t happen.” Another said that he was “so reliable, so responsive” and “mellow”.  Other clients also said that Taylor was considered hardworking and reliable. Taylor faces a potential state prison sentence of  years and four months to leconvicted as charged, according to the District Attorneyaposs Office.

During the chat, Serena revealed her close bond with the prince saying heaposs like her le coach and that they chat for hours.But who are the coupleaposs other showbiz pals, and which friends are they no longer close to  Here we take a look... Serena Williams  The tennis champ has had a long-standing friendship with Meghan and it appears that has now extended to Harry too. Meghan first met Serena in  at the Super Bowl in Miami, Florida.Speaking about their friendship on her former lestyle blog The Tig, Meghan said she and the tennis ace bonded very quickly when playing a game of flag football, which is a iation of American football.Meghan wrote: “We hit it off immediately. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .“Taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff.” Then-actress Meghan and Serena were also snapped together at the  Super Bowl in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and again at the launch of Serenaaposs clothing line during New York Fashion Week in . Serena was at Meghanaposs wedding to Harry in  and also attended her baby shower in New York in . Meghan has also been spotted at the US Open as well as Wimbledon lending her support to Serena when sheaposs been in action. Ellen DeGeneres  Another celeb close to Harry and Meghan is chat show host Ellen DeGeneres along with her we Portia de Rossi.They are neighbours in Montecito, Calornia, and in a recent interview on her show, Meghan revealed how they had all spent Halloween together. Ellen also hinted at how close they were last year, saying sheaposd invited some dancers on to her show at Meghanaposs recommendation. She also leapt to Meghan and Harryaposs defence on her talk show, saying it was not fair seeing them get attacked. She said: They are two of the most down-to-earth compassionate people, theyaposre doing so much good for the world.  Ellen and Meghan struck up a friendship in  after an encounter at a pet shelter, which ended with Meghan taking home Bogart, a Labrador-shepherd mix.Meghan recalled the encounter in an interview in Best Health in , when she said: Now, I donapost know her, but Ellen goes aposIs that your dog aposAnd I said, aposNo,apos and sheaposs like, aposYou have to take that dog.apos And I said, aposWell, Iaposm deciding.apos And sheaposs like, aposRescue the dog!apos Itaposs sort of likeOprah tells you to do something. Iaposm sitting there holding him and sheaposs like aposHave you thought of a name for him yet apos And I said, aposWell, I think Iaposd name him Bogart,apos and sheaposs like aposYouaposre taking the dog home.apos And she walks outside to get into her car but instead of getting in she turns around and comes and taps on the window glass and she yells aposTake the dog!apos And so I brought him home. Because Ellen told me to. Orlando Bloom Last year, Harry spoke of a friendship he has struck up with actor Orlando Bloom, who lives down the road from him in Calornia.Speaking on Dax Shepardaposs Armchair Expert podcast to discuss his mental health struggles, Harry admitted that he regularly texts his new friend, who is dating singer Katy Perry, about paparazzi. He said: Two days ago Orlando Bloom sent me a message because he is just down the road and we sort of keep in contact because of the paparazzi. He sent me a photograph which his security got of this long-haired guy with a beanie on, ear pods on with his massive camera lying in the back of his x truck, blacked-out windows. Orlando later voiced Harry in the satirical cartoon The Prince, and the series came under fire for its portrayal of the royals.During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, creator Gary Janetti said: I donapost knowHarry has said anything to Orlando about it, but I know before the show premiered, he was aware that Orlando was doing it. Priyanka Chopra  Actress Priyanka Chopra has been a close friend of Meghanaposs - even before the former Suits actress met Harry.The pair first met at an ELLE Women in Television dinner in  and struck up a bond. Soon after, Meghan interviewed Priyanka for her blog The Tig.Meanwhile in , Priyanka wrote an open letter about her friend before the royal wedding and around the same time Meghan made it onto the TIME  list.Priyankaaposs heartfelt note read: More than anything , Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to. “People the world can be inspired by. Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people.” Zendaya and Tom Holland It appears that a new couple in Harry and Meghanaposs inner circle could be Spider-Man stars Zendaya and Tom Holland.It was reported last weekend that Harry and Meghan contacted the acting stars out of the blue and asked for a sit down with the pair despite never meeting them before.The secret meeting is thought to have gone ahead at the Sussexaposs Montecito home. The apparent meet up could have been due to the royals looking to pull in big names for their £million Spoty podcast project which has so far failed to materialise - other than a one-off special.And those they are no longer close to...The Obamas Harry and Meghan seemed to have had a close bond with former US president Barack Obama and his we Michelle. They had been pictured together at sporting events around the world and Michelle and Meghan worked together on a number of projects. But last year, the couplesapos relationship was put under the spotlight after the Sussexes werenapost at the former presidentaposs glitzy th birthday party in Marthaaposs Vineyard. Itaposs unclearHarry and Meghan were not invited, or simply were unable to attend. But itaposs been suggested that their friendship with the Obamas has gone cold.And according to royal expert Camilla Tominey, their absence could have been down to the fact that the former president and first lady do not approve of Harryaposs attacks on the royal family.An insider told Camilla writing in the: The Obamas didn’t like Harry attacking his family. They value family and certainly aren’t the type of people who would want their children talking to the press.Piers Morgan There is no love lost between Piers Morgan and Meghan - but this was not always the case.The pair has been friends after they connected on social media back in . Piers has bragged that he and the former Suits actress struck up a friendship online and that they quickly became in regular contact. When Piers followed the actress on Twitter, she sent him a direct message which read: Well hello there - thanks for the follow. Big fan of yours!They were on such good terms that Meghan would send Piers previews of Suits episodes for him to watch before fans did. Then in the summer of , their friendship progressed with them arranging to meet up for drinks when Meghan was visiting the UK. She met with Piers at his favourite pub - The Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington - and he claims they chatted for hours. Piers then says Meghan went cold and that their drink in Kensington was the last time he ever spoke to her.He explained: She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Not a word. I’d been ghosted.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Meghan MarklePrince HarrySerena WilliamsRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But one woman on TikTok has one tradition sheaposs definitely not going to be following when she ties the knot later this year, as itaposs made it onto her strict list of rules for her wedding day.And which tradition is the bride-to-be banning  The garter toss.Jasmine Cruz, who posts under the username @cruzjasmine, has insisted her husband wonapost be sticking his hands underneath her wedding dress to remove her garter in front of her family and friends - because she finds the tradition gross and weird. In a video explaining her list of rules, she said: Weaposre not doing the garter thing, thataposs gross. I already have to kiss a man in public in front of all these people. Now you want him to go under my dress and pretend to..., before making gagging noises and cutting herself off. Jasmineaposs other rules included making sure no one wears white except for the bride - which seemed to be so important to the woman that she accidentally listed it twice. And the bride-to-be is also banning kids from her wedding, except in instances where people are travelling from places that are too far away and need to bring their children with them, and her siblings who are all under .  She is also refusing entry to anyone that wasnapost invited and has set limits on how many plus ones sheaposs giving out to her guests. But not all of Jasmineaposs rules were strict, as she said sheaposs allowing her bridesmaids to wear whatever they want and is happy for them to throw on a dress or a suit - just as long as the colour scheme flows throughout all the members of the bridal party. The bride also jokingly listed bridesmaids are all [rainbow emoji] as a rule, but claried she didnapost mean for it to come across as a requirement, and instead meant that it just so happens that the bridal party are all members of the LGBTQ+ community. She said: It just kind of coincidentally worked out that all of my bridesmaids are all at least a little bit part of the LGBT community, and I love that. We just all are somehow a little bit ... yaposknow. I love that.  Jasmine and her fiance are paying for an open bar for their guests so expect them to take advantage of it, and have even said the vendors should be treated as guests when on their breaks. And Jasmineaposs final rule is one we probably all have listed for our weddings - no big announcements. She said: If youaposre pregnant, keep it to yourself. If you want to propose, keep that to yourself. Do not come to my wedding day and take the attention away from me and my man, you will be tackled. The list of rules has split opinion among the  million people who have viewed Jasmineaposs video, as some say her demands are just too strict. One person said: Wow she’s really strict. Just elope, that might be better for you to save you the headache of a wedding. While another added: Why do people not want people at their wedding  The more the merrier, why not  Why do you have to be so damn stingy and rude  But a third disagreed, insisting: I love the no garter rule, itaposs a really disturbing thing to do in front of family. And someone  wrote: As a former event planner, I approve all these. Weddings made me want to elope or do a small brunch.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MarriageWeddingsWedding dayTikTokViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However, she claims staff ordered her to leave on account of her being too sexyJuju felt disrespected after she was asked to leave Image: Jam Press @jujuvieira_oficialByJulia BanimAudience WriterLaura Abernethy:,  Feb |commentsInfluencer Juju Vieirawas had been enjoying a day at the Vatican on January , as part of her trip to Rome. Little did she know that her choice of outfit would prove to be an issue. The model, who is originally from Brazil, has alleged that she was asked to leave the holy site after being informed that she wasnapost dressed properly. Having been unaware that her fitted dress and long boots were against the rules, Juju says she felt disrespected by the man whoaposd asked her to leave, explaining that sheaposd simply gone to the Holy City to take pictures like everyone . Juju recalled: A gentleman who worked there came close to me and said that the place was for prayers and that I was not dressed properly and invited me to leave, aposkickedapos me out of the Vatican. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She explained that she was embarrassed because there were other people there who heard this, adding that she felt disrespected. Unfortunately for Juju, the Vatican does enforce a strict dress code for both male and female visitors and shoulders and knees do need to be covered at all times. According to the official website: “Women are not permitted to wear sleeveless tops, crop tops, or tight shirts. Shoulders should be covered, andwearing a skirt or dress, it must cover the knees. Women are also advised to bring along a shawl and a pair of leggings when visiting during the colder months along with a light jacket that can be rolled up into a pleasingly tiny bag. However, Juju hadnapost known about this code prior to her visit and had simply planned her outfit as she usually would had she been out exploring any new place. She added: “I didnapost even know there were rules. A person of common sense will not visit the Vatican in club clothes. I was stylish in my winter clothes, everything matched. I went in comfortable clothes that I would feel good in for long walks. Comfort was my only concern. Sharing the story of this “unpleasant situation” on Instagram, Juju received plenty of sympathy from her , followers, with one person remarking, “this is absurd my friend. Another replied with a series of shocked face emojis. However, others explained that it wasnapost unusual for those breaking the dress code to be asked to leave, with a third person writing: “Well,you go dressed with deep necklines, very tight clothes, thataposs normal.

Underneath an ad shared to Facebook, one shopper admitted that they thought it was a Crimewatch post, while another remarked this ad looks more like someone escaping the scene of a crime rather than highlighting the merchandise. A third amused person wrote: I thought it was a dodgy person that was sneaking away from a crime scene! I suppose it is clever marketing because it got our attention. Fortunately, the slightly shty undertone to the ad has done nothing to dent the popularity of the striped pleated midaxi skirt, which has since sold out in all sizes apart from a regular . The £ skirt - which looks much less sinister onsite - is said to come in a swishy pleated silhouette, which falls to an elegant midaxiwith an elasticated waist allowing for all-day comfort.

The man goes on to sprinkle dehydrated onions on top of the Big Mac sauce, before adding lettuce on each and two pickles on top and one piece of cheese on the bottom. A burger patty is added to both sides, then comes the most challenging part. He explains: You have to lt the club up and put it on top of the heel, so youaposve basically assembled a sandwich.

All Tracy has to do is place her arm next to a partner to figure out his size, an attribute the yoga instructor and le coach says she really enjoys knowing about for imagination purposes when you’re not together. Given that the tat is rather discreet, this allows Tracy to innocently reach up to stroke his stomach whilst taking a glance at my arm alongside it to count the inches rather than guessing with hands.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Tracy, who describes her ink as being a somewhat discreet but practical design and tool to enhance my le, explaining: I’m a woman who enjoys pleasure, body confidence and intimacy and feel that women have just as much right as men to speak honestly about sexual encounters. With a personal best of  rolls between the sheets in one day, Tracy has a high sex drive and knows exactly what sheaposs looking for in a prospective partner. The former Page Three girl added: Being single and online dating at present, there seems to be a massive energy around the height of guys as every girl daydreams of a ft+ Prince in shining armour to sweep her off of her feet, whereas in all honesty, I dream of a ”+ Prince instead! For Tracy, the devil is in the detail and she really does enjoy knowing the size of a partner, explaining: Whilst some people keep hold of underwear or sleep in their partneraposs t-shirts, I enjoy knowing all measurements for imagination purposes when you’re not together. Tracy began considering this cheeky design following an encounter with a date who didn’t know his size, or rather didn’t choose to reveal it to me. Shocked by this admission, Tracy found her partneraposs penis to be incredibly impressive and couldnapost believe he’d never taken the time to measure himself. She joked at the time that she would bring a ruler with me next time. Her date asked her where it was and they both enjoyed a good laugh about it. This conversation led Tracy to start thinking about getting a tattoo in inches that I could take with me everywhere thus satisfying her need to measure things discreetly without making anybody feel judged or insecure. She added: “It’s not all about size, it’s what you do with it and how your partner makes you feel when building an intimate connection, but for those who enjoy finer details it really is the cherry on the cake for me.” According to Tracy, her -year-old daughter Millisent is now at an age where she realises my cheeky sense of humour and picks up on adult jokes which she’d missed before. She added: She suspected my tattoo was purposely measured in inches and I may have confirmed her suspicions when measuring cucumbers. Going forward, Tracy is rather tempted to add some dots from my thumb to my index finger to measure girth at the same time, however, she is worried that this might make her intentions too obvious. She added: I guess it all depends on where somebody is looking when I whip it out to count!”Have you opted for an unusual tattoo  Let us know in the comments or email us at yourmirror@mirrorRead MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Tattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Has it been called The Orange all along and we’ve not noticed  Honestly, I am baffled. Someone please explain this to me and restore my faith in humanity. And the shopperaposs post left other fans of The Range equally as confused, as they admitted theyaposd never noticed the bizarre logo placement before and were now convinced the shop was supposed to be called The Orange.

Sibongile Mude frequently takes to TikTok on her account, @sibs, to share videos from her bedroom window of the cars in question, and has even taken to sticking angry notes to their windows and windscreen in an attempt to dissuade the drivers from parking there again.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In one clip, Sibongile showed off the note she writes up, which read: Your parking is NOT okay. You have blocked in my car - in my driveway! I am now stuck!! While another message written by the stressed homeowner read: You have parked in front of my driveway. I need to park MY CAR. Sibongile and her friends have even confronted some of the drivers who happen toto their vehicle while the woman is filming, with one woman caught on camera telling them her parking was not a big deal. Explaining what the woman had said, Sibongile wrote in the comments of one video: Whataposs said ... aposYouaposre blocking my carapos and she said, aposItaposs not much of a big dealapos and then she told her, to do one ... plus other words l can not say.  Sibongile even shared one video which showed three dferent cars parked across the exit to her driveway on three separate days, and explained that some of them are there for hours. She wrote in the comments: Itaposs annoying because you guys only see  seconds, but some of these guys park for  to  hours, and we need in and out of our driveway quite often. Commenters on the womanaposs videos have come up with a iety of solutions to her problem, including asking the council to paint lines on the road in front of her driveway or placing cones down to deter people from parking. One person said: You might have to cover some or all the cost but I’m sure the local council can authorise white lines to help people realise there’s access needed.  While another added: Canapost you put some cones down to stop people parking there  Is it illegal to park across a driveway  Parking across a driveway is only illegalthere is a dropped kerb, but this has nothing to do with the restriction of access to the driveway itself and is in place because dropped kerbs are a no-go for parking. Evena vehicle is only partially covering a dropped kerb, the owner will be committing a driving offence and could be liable to receive a penalty of up to three points and a fine of up to £. However, parking close to a dropped kerb is not illegal, eventhis restricts access to a driveway.According to Confused, police are unlikely to get involved in cases where the parking over the dropped kerb stops you from moving your vehicle into your driveway, butthe parking issue stops you from leaving they may treat it as an anti-social behaviour offence.Anti-social behaviour is defined by the Crime and Disorder Actas: “Acting in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household as the defendant.” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The family, from Ohio in the US, have accused Summa Health System of malpractice, negligence and fraud. The couple alleged the health practice failed to “properly collect” and “safeguard” John’s genetic material. Speaking in a virtual press conference, Jeanine said she and John had been to see a fertility doctor for help around  years ago. She claimed they “couldn’t have been clearer” in their goal, which was to have a child who was genetically related to both of them.  “I underwent the in vitro fertilisation with the understanding that Mike’s genetic materials would be used in this procedure,” she said. The family first learned of the alleged botched procedure upon purchasing a DNA test for Jessica, before she went to Europe in . Jeanine explained the family thought the it could be “cool” for her to connect with distant relatives in the countries she visited.  However, instead of her father’s Italian heritage on her test, Jessica instead found that she was of Irish, English, German, Welsh and French descent. Jessica said there were “no words” to express what she and her parents had been through and claimed she was in “total disbelief”. The organisation has made a statement to local media outlets saying it was taking the allegations “seriously”. “At this point, we have not met with the family or conducted testing of our own. Given the very limited information that we have and the amount of time that has passed, it remains our hope that the attorneys representing the family will work with us to make that next step a priority,” Mike Bernstein, system director of Corporate Communications for Summa Health System, said. Jessica had since tracked down her biological father through ancestry and genealogists hired by her lawyer. It has been confirmed that the man gave sperm for an insemination procedure on the same day the Harveys were in his office. The Harvey family have said they hope their lawsuit will lead to federal oversight of the fertility industry.

Alexey Barkhatov was struck by a passing boat and its propeller left a gaping wound in his hand which needed hospital treatment. He had gone ing with a friend when the horror accident happened while he was fishing with a spear at Sydney Harbour, Australia. Alexey now wants the regulations on water routes to be changed after his brush with death which left him badly injured.He told Yahoo Australia : cm to the left and this boat could have killed me and my ing buddy,  I was with my ing buddy, really shallow with two floats, when he appeared out of nowhere, speeding. I tried to defend my hand with the gun and was able to e quickly but not as deep as I hoped. He regularly es where the the accident happened and says they have two very visible floats which can be seen from some distanceMr Barkhatov and his friend had been ing near Middle Head for a few hours when they spotted some fish and were preparing to target them when he suddenly heard a noise.There were boats nearby and after hearing the noise of an engine he ed quickly and defended himself with his spear gun.  He believes this saved his le when the boat hit him and its propeller caught the edge of his hand leaving badly wounded. He was covered with blood after arriving above the water and the boat drive helped him on board. They used a dogaposs lead to stem the blood while his ing partner called the maritime police and took them to shore where paramedics were waiting to take him to hospital.  Mr Barkhatovaposs endured three hours of surgery but doctors were luckily able to save his hand. Iaposm very lucky, he said. Thataposs why now Iaposm trying to find a way how to use my story to prevent such accidents in the future.The New South Wales government website says most water routes do not have have a limit for speed..It says: All vessels must travel at a safe speed at all times A safe speed gives you enough time to stop, or turn your vessel to avoid any sudden danger, such as a collision, injury to people, or damage to things. Mr Barkhatov called for the enforcement of speed limits and increased curbs for boats near swimmers and ers. He says buoys could show the boats where swimmers or other water users could be which he insists could save lives.

It was a fascinating experience.#The new orchestral work was inspired by Islay’s stunning natural environment, known for its rich terrain and peaty whisky.Five short thematic movements celebrate Islay’s sunrises and coastal shores, while giving a playful nod to the island’s abundant whisky industry.Helen added: #The work centres around The Rinns – a beautul peninsula overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.#My father used to talk about The Rinns of Islay, and as a child, I started to create stories and soundscapes linked to the island.#The work offers a visual, almost cinematic listening experience, with atmospheres and landmarks inspiring the visual imagination.#The work features on a new album Legends and Light Vol. , featuring works by seven composers.While many of the pieces are arranged for orchestral ensembles, listeners will also find the Highland bagpipes and Irish Uilleann pipes featured on the album, offering a deeply rewarding listening experience.Helen is delighted with feedback so far: #I’m thrilled with audiences’ responses to the music.#Listeners have tuned in from across the UK, the USA and as far afield as New Zealand, keeping Scotland on the international map for new music.#"},{"url":null,"title":"rachael-hamilton-food-bank-comments-see-borders-msp-criticised","story":"A BORDERS MSP has admitted her “phrasing was poor” following backlash over comments made about food bank users.Last week Rachael Hamilton, of the Conservatives, said those using the community facilities are “less well-educated” when it comes to cooking and preparing meals.Following the comments – made during a meeting of the Rural Affairs, Islands and Natural Environment Committee – Alasdair Allan, an SNP MSP, called on Mrs Hamilton to apologise.:Man, , dies in two-car Borders crashHe told The National: “Rachael Hamilton’s comments were utterly disgraceful and an insult to thousands of families across Scotland who do everything they can to put food on the table every day.“People relying on foodbanks often find innovative ways to make meals go further and it is completely inappropriate for a Tory MSP to suggest that families in poverty are ‘less well-educated’ in how to cook and prepare food.”In response, Mrs Hamilton – who represents the Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire constituency – said that in context her point was “clear”.:Plans submitted for new supermarket in Selkirk“I did not mean to cause any offence,” Mrs Hamilton told the Border . “My phrasing was poor but in the context of the discussion, the point I was making was clear and supported by the representative of the NFU [National Farmers’ Union].“My point was referencing the  out of  responses to the consultation on the Good Food Nation Bill that stated education about food is key to realising the social, economic, environmental, health and well-being benefits that the legislation seeks to achieve.“I want everyone to have access to good local food, which would benefit local suppliers in the Borders.“Learning about cooking and home economics is integral to child and adult education, and should form more of a focus in our schools as we try to reduce high fat, salt and sugar diets going forward.”"},{"url":null,"title":"debut-goal-new-gala-fairydean-rovers-signing","story":"MARTIN Scott believes that Gala Fairydean Rovers’ attacking philosophy will suit new signing Scott Cusick’s style and he will be a good addition to the squad.The Glaswegian came off the bench to score the winner against Dalbeattie Star on Saturday but had to be replaced late on after ‘working his socks off.’Scott said: “We just brought Scotty in recently who was available as a free agent. I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of. I knew he would fit into our philosophy and how we want to play the game.“My intention was to give him - minutes, but he came on early and worked his socks off and got his reward with the goal and then we had to being him back off because his legs had just went at that point.“He probably needs a bit more game time in terms of match fitness and sharpness but when he gets up to full speed, he will be a real asset for us.“We went short-term and this gives him a chance to get back playing and enjoying his football. And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two.

This sparked a furious debate in the House of Commons.No guarantee was given by the Prime Minister that an unredacted report would be made available to MPs.In response Borders MP John Lamont said: “It is deeply frustrating that Sue Gray has been unable to release her full report so that we can see the full facts of what has gone on. The country has a right to see the evidence for themselves and it must be published in full when the police investigation concludes.”MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale David Mundell said: “The document which has been presented by Sue Gray is an update on her investigation into alleged gatherings on Government premises during Covid restrictions. It details a number of alleged gatherings, all but four of which are now subject to a separate investigation by the politan Police and, as a result, details of those events have not been reported in the update in order not to prejudice the police investigations.“My strong view is that, when it is possible, the report in its entirety should be published, as I believe everyone has a right to see what has been established.”Both also insisted that anyone found to have broken the lawshould be held accountable.Mr Lamont added: “No one is above the law. Not even the Prime Minister.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.SEE ALSO: ​House-warming hacks to help keep the heating bill downIf you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"boohoo-launches-beauty-range-50-items---get","story":"Januaryis often a time we like to get organised and clear out the things we don’t need or use anymore.With the easing of coronavirus restrictionscome plans in the  diary, and you might be looking to refresh your makeup collection.If you’re looking to organise your outfitsand plan your make-up looks for , we have you covered.Fashion retailer Boohoohas launched its own range of beauty productswith more than  items across makeup and accessories.and The Ultimate Palette –  shades . \" alt\"Border :  Shade Eyeshadow Paletteand The Ultimate Palette –  shades . \" class\"editor-image\"Shade Eyeshadow Paletteand The Ultimate Palette –  shades .Glam up your outfit with this boohoo Beauty The Ultimate Palette –  shades, available in dferent colours.

legal claim.The Teesside club, along with Wycombe, are seeking compensation from the crisis-hit Rams, who were placed in administration last September.The financial situation at Derby is becoming increasingly perilous, with the English Football Leaguegranting administrators an extension to March  to provide proof of funding for the rest of the season.On Thursday the EFL urged all parties involved, including Boro and Wycombe, to engage in urgent mediation to resolve the impasse.MFC has issued a response to the EFLs most recent statement on Derby Countyhttps:t.co hKHwVmtxF— Middlesbrough FCFebruary , Boro welcomed that invitation, and the EFL saying on Wednesday that it disagreed with the administrators’ analysis that, under insolvency legislation, the club could avoid defending Middlesbrough and Wycombe’s claims and that they should not be treated as football-related debts.Middlesbrough accused the administrators of making “scurrilous and unfounded suggestions” that their claim, and Wycombe’s, was preventing the club being sold when they believe the administrators have also failed to reach agreement with major creditors HMRC and MSD Partners.“MFC has always maintained that its claim against Derby County is a football-related debt and that it should be treated as such,” the club statement read.“MFC welcomes the EFL’s confirmation that it shares this view.

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.Get draught excludersA big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Get cookingEating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.Consider getting rugsIf your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.Put tin foil behind your radiatorIf on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The Royal Mint has revealed its top ten rarest  pence coins in circulation.The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.What makes a coin valuable The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the game, the Pupils# management team stated they were satisfied with the effort and performance level of the squad, acknowledging that the dference between the sides on the day, despite the polar dference in league positions, was the conversion of chances.This is something which Finnart has made an art form of in winning games against sides around them who perhaps play more expansive football.Sure enough, this was the case against the Pupils, for the fourth time this season.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, playing Glenvale FC at Ferguslie Park, Paisley.

Binning Wood have been ongoing between village residents and East Lothian Council for a number of years.Now, the route is edging closer to becoming a reality.Plans from the council are looking for a short section of path to be created beside Tyninghame’s schoolhouse.Daniel Wight, from Dunpender Community Council, which covers Tyninghame, was hopeful that a route could be created.He said: “As long as we’ve been here, there has been frustration that there is no way of getting from the village to Binning Wood, which is a major recreational destination for walkers and particularly dog walkers.“There is no way of getting there safely other than getting in a car and driving up, which is crazy – it is less than a mile away.”East Lothian Council undertook a number of public consultations between  and  as part of the development of its core paths plan.At that time, a route was proposed to connect Tyninghame to Binning Wood to the north.The path was to follow an old route from the village’s school towards Lawhead Road and then along a shelter belt to Binning Wood.A document included within the planning application notes: “Most of the route follows paths through shelterbelts, or field margins and when it reaches Tyninghame there was no obvious way into the village.“A thin strip of land adjacent to the School House may once have been a path, but it is overgrown and being right next to the house would impact the privacy of the occupants.“Another option that people have used is to climb over a fence from a paddock.“This project aims to provide a path link from the village to the core path.”Some alterations could be made to the existing vegetation on the application site, with a section “overgrown with lilac and ivy”.East Lothian Council stressed that “every effort” would be made to retain the lilac, while a poplar tree described as being in “very poor condition” might have to be removed.A spokeswoman for the local authority stressed that, evenpermission were granted, there was no timescale for when the path could be created.Mr Wight told the Courier that a public meeting had been held looking at potential routes for the path.He said: “Nick Morgan from East Lothian Council came and talked through the dferent things.“There was overwhelming agreement that this was the path that we should try to pursue.“I think there is a pretty strong consensus that this is what the village would like.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dog-walking-facility-created-opposite-popular-clifftop-cafe-north-berwick","story":"The owners of Castleton Farm are

really want to be a choreographer at a dance school or have my own dance school, but I’m not very sure just yet – just something I can do with dancing.”Fiona also hoped that her daughter would forge a

By closing them off, you will cut out the draught and also ensure that any heat in your property isn’t escaping into that room.A big reason why your home may not be retaining heat very well is because of draughts.Allowing cold air to get into the home will bring the overall temperature down.If you can stop these draughts from getting in, it will make a huge dference to the temperature in your home.Eating hot food will help to warm you up and the process of cooking the food will throw heat out into the kitchen and surrounding areas, meaning your home will warm up as a result.If your house is fully carpeted, then you needn’t worry about this option, as that will help insulate your home.However, you can lose a considerable amount of heat through floorboards or tiles, so putting a rug over the top can make all the dference in your home’s heat retention.If on the occasion you do have the heating on, which you should because it is good for home’s condition, then you should put foil behind your radiators to make sure the heat is forced into the room, rather than getting lost in the wall."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-mint-reveals-10-rarest-50p-coins-circulation","story":"The move to \"new money\" pounds and pence, happened  years ago this month, with the anniversary on  February .Since then, over  iations of the p coin have been circulating and several rare designs have been distributed.The famous Kew Gardens p remains the most coveted coin in circulation, with a mintage of just ,, the Mint said.Other rare designs include Olympic-themed ps minted in .Here, we look at the rarest p coins and how many of each have been made - and how much they could be worth.The  pence piece has become the most valued and collected coin in the UK, with many collectable designs appearing on its heptagonal canvas.Its .mm diameter makes it the largest of any British coin, and allows space for decorative pictures.

One of these is that of \"changing the UK voting tradition of % plus \". Judging by the number of times that this seeps into his correspondence, he is clearly worried by this prospect. The UK, however, does not have \"a voting tradition\" of referenda. It has a tradition of regular parliamentary elections, and where first past the post applies, % plus one has been deemed to be adequate, as the outcome will be revisited in the next election occurring very few years thereafter.Over recent decades, there has been the sporadic referendum in this country, not all of which have been on a % plus one basis. The two most recent were of course on Scottish independence and on leaving the EU and these were overseen by that master of arrogance and insouciance David Cameron, who in relation to the former, blithely let Alex Salmond set the timing and terms. Does Mr Galloway consider that Mr Cameron has set some sort of binding precedent for all future referenda It has been pointed out many times that most countries in the world with written constitutions require super-majorities for constitutional change, as do sporting clubs and political parties, including the SNP. It is ludicrous to suggest that the most important decision that could possibly face the Scottish electorate, that of the irrevocable break-up of the -year-old Union, could be decided upon on the basis of one extra vote on the day, on perhaps a minority turnout of voters. That could never be \"the settled will of the Scottish people\", a phrase beloved of the nationalists, and would be a recipe for future ision and discord.R Murray, Glasgow.* WHETHER wilfully or out of carelessness, as well as confusing Alternative Votewith Proportional Representation , Alasdair Galloway ignores my statement that I supported PR when first past the Postfavoured Labour in Scotland. I can specically point to my signing of Charter  to refute this.Above all, I was convinced of PR by the late Robin Cook, and can recall very clearly his typically waspish comments: \"If FPTP is said to give us strong government, I am sick to the back teeth of [Thatchers] strong government. AndLabour wants to transform British society, we need to have a majority of the electorate behind us in that aim.\"Mr Galloway also insists once again that there is no need for the nationalists to give us a detailed prospectus and that  per cent+ is adequate mandate for major constitutional change. These did not bring about an optimal outcome in the case of leaving the EU – why cannot we learn from that  We should learn from the Brexit debacle that the British way to which he and his fellow nationalists are so attached may not be the best way to proceed in constitutional affairs.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.GOVES PLAN IS A NON-STARTERTOM Gordon suggests that Ian Murray had a headline in mind when he called on civil servants to stop working on a new independence prospectus, and rightly described it as \"an absurd request\". However, Mr Gordon must also have had a headline in mind when he writes that the independence prospectus will be \"a sitting duck\" . I would suggest that without independence, Scotland will remain a sitting duck with Trident weapons of mass destruction sitting in our waters, cold Brexit winds blowing across the country, and dumb and dumber governments we didnt vote for holding sway at Westminster.As weve witnessed this week, a man who apparently doesnt know the meaning of the word \"truth\" and who has repeatedly misled Parliament is allowed to remain in the House of Commons, while a man who did speak the truth is thrown out.As Boris Johnson lurches from one disaster to the next, a cunning plan is devised to ert attention away from the Prime Ministers plight, as Michael Gove presents his \"levelling up\" scheme which has rightly been called \"meaningless window dressing\" and \"frankly insulting\" by the SNPs Tommy Sheppard . Most ludicrous of all, Mr Gove has suggested in an interview with Times Radio that the unelected, undemocratic House of Lords could move to Glasgow while renovations were taking place at Westminster, and that such a move \"would do us all good\".I cannot imagine what good that champagne and snoozing chamber for failed politicians who can claim hundreds of pounds a day for just turning up would do for Glasgow, and I suspect that Mr Goves nonsensical proposal will be greeted with a Glasgow kiss.Ruth Marr, Stirling.CRITICS ARE BOOSTING THE YES CAUSEUNDER this Tory Government, we are currently witnessing the biggest elephant in the Westminster room since – well, since the last one.This has led to many Tory peers and MPs – lightweight and heavyweight – to seek the resignation of the Prime Minister on a daily basis.You would imagine that those who support the Prime Minister and indeed the Union would be keeping their heads well below the parapet in this time of lies, deceit and fraud within that cesspit of sleaze otherwise known as the Mother of Parliaments. Far from it, for what we are seeing is the complete opposite.Presumably in an attempt to ert attention, a small number of serial “ SNP bad” correspondents are ignoring the large elephant and writing letters seeking to stir up the most tenuous nonsense regarding the Scottish Government.To be honest, I no longer trust any figures emanating from the UK Government and have not done so for a considerable time. Instead, it is to independent, respected experts outside the UK that I turn and learn the facts about important subjects such as the truth behind the GERS figures, the educational performance in Scotland’s schools and universities and Scotland’s response to the pandemic and vaccine rollout.Without being blasé, it’s clear that Scotland is doing very well.However, may I encourage the cabal of “SNP bad” correspondents to keep on with their letters, as I am convinced that they have inadvertently become very effective recruiters for the independence cause.Stewart Falconer, Alyth.OPEN AND SHUT CASEAS an independence supporter, I despair once again at the SNP, this time over its plan to spend £, of our money to cut a couple of inches of the bottom of , school classroom doors to improve ventilation . Can I offer a simple and cheaper alternative  Leave the doors open.Tom Strang, Barrhead.UKRAINE CRISIS IS GOOD FOR THE USATHE peaceful unity of the Western European nations has been undermined by the madness of Brexit and the prosperity of the US armaments industry has been undermined by the withdrawal of western forces from Afghanistan. The first of the above has no doubt emboldened Vladimir Putin, which in turn has given the US a timely opportunity to highlight threats to Ukraine with consequential justication for increased orders for weaponry. A threat of military engagement somewhere far away from the US in which US forces are unlikely to be directly engaged is seldom bad news for the US economy, particularly in the aftermath of a pandemic.Its an ill wind that blows nobody any good.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.* I WAS concerned that the Prime Minister went to Ukraine and for what reason given the uproar he is currently causing in our own country , so I checked the current map of Europe.Ukraine is bounded by Russia, Belarus, Poland, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary, of which four are members of the EU, which the UK has left.The whole visit smacks of imperialism. A distraction from current UK affairs. Interfering at the behest of the Americans who,asked, would have no idea where Ukraine, or even, Europe, was in the world.While I do not expect the UK to drop our heads in the sand, surely this is an EU issue and a situation that we are best kept out of, particularly as we have neither the financial nor moral stability to be sending troops.Ken Mackay, Glasgow.Read more: Must we be forever cheated by the electoral system "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-val-mcdermid-needs-show-magnanimity-bury-hatchet-raith-rovers-board","story":"It is not easy to publicly admit incompetence and failure – it takes bravery – and the directors have exhibited the necessary fortitude to confess their shortcomings, together with an unreserved apology and recognition that “we have all learned a hard but valuable lesson”.In addition, I personally think the chairman should have issued the apology in person at a news conferenceand resigned.

Interestingly, the meter has worked for the power companies on both occasions, sending meter readings to them. This saves the companies money through efficiency savings and increases their profits whilst I have to pay through my bills for a gadget that is of no benefit to me.When I raised the issue of the non-ing meter reader with the company I was told to switch it off and switch it on again, utterly useless advice.Smart meter schemes should be stopped, the charge removed from power consumers bills and compensation paid to those consumers who have seen no benefit from having a meter installed.It is a myth that they help consumers save, as the customer representative that I spoke to said,you want a cup of tea you will boil the kettle, not consult your smart meter to see how much it costsBill Eadie, Gfnock.DISMAY AT CELTIC CONNECTIONS MOVEI WAS thrilled to discover some months ago the creation of some wheelchair-accessible spaces in the stalls at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and have since booked them, enjoying a much improved visual and acoustic experience.Imagine my surprise when attempting to book the same space for a Celtic Connections concert I was informed that, at the request of the promoters, this improved provision has been removed, leaving only the seats at the side of the stage, where both sound and vision are far poorer.I believe this leaves eight spaces in total for wheelchair users in the entire auditorium within a provision of , seats, a whopping . per cent, and as already noted they are amongst the poorest offering in the building.Having only recently discovered the improvement in provision at the Concert Hall, after a letime of sitting in what has become known as \"the wheelchair ghetto\" I am astonished and hurt that we are once again being excluded from normal social activities. Celtic Connections takes some pride in its image of inclusion, fusion and learning across barriers. How ironic to see the last barrier alive and well at this festival.Marian Miller, Gfnock.BILINGUAL IN SCOTS AND ENGLISHI NOTE the discussion on the Scots language . I was born and grew up in a small Ayrshire village where the language of communication for everyone was Scots. From the village school I moved on to secondary education in Ayr Academy. Staff and pupils there all spoke Standard English in school – that was expected. I quickly learned to adapt and soon became bilingual, quickly switching my modes of speech to my environment.However, the headmaster of our small village school was a Burns enthusiast and, on the occasions when he became our class teacher, he had us read aloud many of Burnss poems. We also had to memorise many of those poems. I can still recite from memory To a Mouse, To a Mountain Daisy, A Mans a Man, and almost the whole of Tam O Shanter. They remain in my memory still – and I am in my eighties – and I am grateful for that.As children playing out of doors, we sang, chanted, shouted and recited many rhymes in Scots. There were skipping rhymes, counting rhymes, stoatin rhymes and a huge iety of playground rhymes and party rhymes. There were even nursery rhymes in Scots. These old rhymes were often funny, and sometimes rude, but we learned, while skipping, playing with a ball, and just playing together outside, about the world around us: \"There she goes, there she goes, peerie heels and pointed toes, look at her feet, she thinks shes neat, black stockings and dirty feet.\"I owe my love of poetry and of the Scots language to Miss Marion McWilliam, our English teacher at Ayr Academy, and to DG Smith, the headmaster of my small Ayrshire village school. I have been happy during my le to be bilingual.

All helped by the fact that Franz Ferdinand mark theirto live shows by playing hit after hit to an audience clearly thrilled to be hearing them and quite possibly just thrilled to be out.Ahead of a new greatest hits album coming out next month this intimate gig, recorded by  Music for its Independent Venue Week, was a reminder of the joy of live music. Singing, dancing, alcohol-throwing. And, for the band, it was a first chance to play with new drummer Audrey Tait in a show that wasn’t for a fashion label.Following a support slot from Hamish Hawk, the band arrived onstage and launched immediately into The Dark of the Matinee, signalling their intention that this was going to be an all-killer, no filler kind of evening. The good news for the band in  is a new song like Billy Goodbye, all glam rock stomp and catchphrase chorus , does not sound anaemic when nestled in between the tunes from the band’s imperial phase.And there are so many of them. There’s a danger with Franz Ferdinand that their first hit Take Me Out overshadows everything they’ve done since, but the compilation album Hits to the Head and shows like this should be a reminder that they’ve had nearly  years of making music now and know their way around a pop song. Darts of Pleasure, Do You Want To, This Fire all were wheeled out and all sounded fresh and vibrant.Now a five piece, with Tait joining founder members Alex Kapranos and Bob Hardy, alongside Julian Corrie and Dino Bardot, there were few signs of ring-rustiness on show here. Andsinger Kapranos is the obvious visual centrepiece of the band, it should be noted that Hardy’s Buster Keatonesque deadpan demeanour is just as compelling.It’s possible that after months without live music anything would have seemed good to me right now, but this was the sound [and look] of a band remembering how much fun it is to play live. The result superfantastich, naturlich.Franz Ferdinand will be interviewed in The Herald Magazine on February "},{"url":null,"title":"new-archbishop-glasgow-appointed-pope-francis","story":"He succeeds Archbishop Philip Tartaglia who died suddenly at his home in Glasgow in January last year.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole. It is simply a no-brainer for the government to commit to continuing that backing in full – and I shall be making the case to the minister on this matter again.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If the administrators believe that the EFL are not entitled to take this stance, MFC has offered to refer the matter to a judge to decide.“The administrators were appointed in September but have consistently refused to engage with MFC’s attempts to engage with them to reach a resolution. vw,vw,px, px\"Derby were placed in administration last September .“There are several letters from us which the administrators have ignored. MFC is extremely disappointed that this administration has not been concluded successfully and that the administrators have, instead, through the media, continuously sought to make scurrilous and unfounded suggestions that it is the claims of our club and Wycombe, and the EFL, that are preventing a successful outcome.“It is not true and these statements are deeply unfair, not only to our club, but also to the Derby County supporters who deserve better.”Derby’s administrators declined to comment on the claims when contacted by the PA news agencyThe Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said on Friday that the extra time granted to provide proof of funding must be treated as a “vital leline” to secure the Rams’ long-term future.Pauline Latham, the Conservative MP for Mid-Derbyshire, asked for a statement from the Government next week to update on progress, and how fan interests are being represented in the negotiations.I raised the campaign to #SaveDerbyCounty again in Parliament.It is crucial that the administrators and the EFL use this month to overcome the issues preventing the sale of the club – and not to wait until the deadline is once again approaching.https:t.co OJvhWoZCO pic tKYHyeryi— Pauline LathamFebruary , Rees-Mogg said: “The Minister for Sportand officials of DCMS are in regular contact with the English Football League and administrators about the club’s future.“Ultimately, it is for the EFL and the administrators and the clubs to resolve issues to ensure the survival of Derby County Football Club, but the Government has urged pragmatism from all parties to find a solution.“It is positive that the EFL has granted a four-week extension to Derby County. This is a vital leline for the survival of the club and the opportunity must be utilised to ensure a suitable outcome is reached with the interest of Derby County’s fans in mind.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is the pinnacle of your rugby career winning the Bobby Cup.”Serious Six Nations business begins this weekend, with Wales not rated as major title contenders by the bookmakers, despite winning it last season.Captains run✔️🏟Next stop, Aviva Stadium for the #GuinnessSixNations opener. #IREvWAL pic BnqvSErsW— Welsh Rugby Union 🏉February , “As I have said all week, we always start as fourth or fth favourites,” Biggar added.“Every year, we come into the Six Nations behind the big three , and I think Scotland are ahead of us with the bookies this week.“It has been the same for the last  years. But I think people forget as well, the last  years we have been the most successful team in it, winning it four times and Ireland and England winning it three times.“It is no issue for us, it is absolutely no dferent for us coming into the tournament as underdogs. vw,vw,px, px\"Dan Biggar will captain Wales in their Six Nations clash against Ireland “Whether we’ve won it the last year, whether we have got a full-strength team, half a team missing, whatever it is, it’s always the same.”Wales have not claimed a Six Nations victory against Ireland at the Aviva Stadium since .And their degree of dficulty is considerably increased by injuries sidelining the likes of Biggar’s fellow British and Irish Lions Alun Wyn Jones, George North, Leigh Halfpenny, Ken Owens, Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi.But after ending their Autumn Nations Series campaign with victory against Australia just over two months ago, Wales will not lack confidence.Captains Run ✅Check out the best action shots from Friday mornings squad session at @avivastadium ⬇️#TeamOfUs | #IREvWAL— Irish RugbyFebruary , “There is no doubt we are missing a lot of key men who have got a serious amount of caps and quality around the pitch,” said Biggar, who skippers his country for the first time.“We have got to make sure that we have got to have a little bit about us, go on the front foot and try and take the game to Ireland.“I want to make sure that the lads who are playing in their first Six Nations, or starting their first game or haven’t had as much experience, I want them to believe they are good enough and that we are not just rocking up tomorrow to soak up everything Ireland have got.“These young lads have nothing to fear.

He only had a wash bag, three second-hand coats, a few stained duvets, and CDs.”He lived with the Swailes family for many years after being in care as a child, with Swailes Snr telling him he was his “boss”, Ms Webster said.When not undergoing dangerous work such as repointing chimneys and replacing roof tiles, Swailes Snr would order him to do chores such as painting the kitchen and cutting the grass.Ms Webster said: “Peter Swailes Senior had a far better standard of living – an elaborate, carpeted home with expensive personal belongings.

I enjoy long walks to the shops, watching football and have made new friends.”Martin Hill, deputy head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit, said: “We believe this is the first time a modern slavery victim has been able to give pre-recorded evidence for a court in England or Wales.“It allowed an exceptionally vulnerable victim to tell his own story of what happened in his own way and ultimately contributed towards this guilty plea.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments. However, as there would be no First or Deputy First Minister in place, no new decisions could take place. That would mean that the current COVID- restrictions, including the wearing of masks would remain in place for the forseeable. Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while there is doubt over whether a scheduled apology for victims of historical sexual abuse will be made. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. Speaking at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Mr Givan said the “institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew’s agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol”. He added, “The consent principal is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement, and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through the resolution of the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point.” Mr Givan said that being First Minister had been the “privilege of my letime”. He added that when he began in politics  years ago he “never expected to serve the people of Northern Ireland as first minister”. The Lagan Valley MLA said that “over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister, we have made progress that will improve our society. “ Earlier, Sinn Feacutein president Mary Lou McDonald said “we cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a ing executive”, adding that her party would not facilitate this. “In the absence of a ing executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say,” she said. “We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre.” Speaking at the same press conference, Ms ONeill said the actions of the DUP were a deliberate act of harm”. Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie has said that the DUP have shown no leadership whatsoever. If theres changes to the protocol in the coming weeks or months, itll be because of the hard work done behind the scenes to get those through negotiations. It will not be done by a minister resigning from their post. The DUP leadership’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland,” according to SDLP leader Colm Eastwood. Resigning from government when people are struggling to provide for their families, heat their homes and deal with the cost of living tells you all you need to know about the DUP - for them the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, he added. People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. As for the Alliance Party, their deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said Mr Givan’s resignation would be “an act of huge harm”, adding that it was “a self-destructive approach by the DUP”. On the other hand, Jim Allister, the leader However, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voiceparty, which is not in the power-sharing coalition, said Mr Givans resignation would be better late than never. Its the price of Stormont implementing a protocol that day-by-day is dismantling the union, Jim Allister said. It is a price no unionists can pay or should have ever had to pay. Speaking following the resignation of the first minister, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party had reminded the UK government of its promises. This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early  and have participated in the political institutions since then, he said. I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irelands position in it."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4422777.jpg--.jpg?1643983873000\n","title":"local entrepreneurs are urged to go for it in 2022","story":"Almost , entrepreneurs across Northern Ireland have been supported by the Go For It Programme over the past four years, with more than , new business plans drawn up in .The scheme, which aims to help entrepreneurs across the country to translate their business idea into reality, is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.Mid and East Antrim BC has banded together with Council areas across Northern Ireland to urge local entrepreneurs to Go For It’ in  with the support of the programme.

They all have had their own personalities and have brought dferent qualities to the job and I’ve enjoyed working alongside each one.”Another positive change Muriel witnessed was the reduction of the speed limit outside the school to mph.“This really helps,” explains Muriel. “It’s such a busy road, especially with all the lorries coming from Larne so mph at arriving and leaving times is vital.“I’ve had a few near misses with speeding vehicles over the years soeveryone sticks to the mph limit it makes it alot safer for the children.”Although looking forward to her retirement, there are aspects of the job Muriel says she will greatly miss.“I’ll miss everyone I work with and of course the children! “I’ll also miss waving at everyone in the mornings and afternoons because I’ve built up alot of friendships over the years and got to know alot of the parents. I made a great friend through the school, Stella Rea who has sadly passed away, but she was something  and a great lady!“I’ll also miss the children and hearing all their stories and woes! I’ve seen many a fall and tumble and witnessed many games in the playground over the years and can truthfully say I’ve enjoyed every minute.”Chairman of the school’s Board of Governors, Mr Jim Allister paid tribute to Muriel’s years of service. He said: “Often schools are valued and judged on the quality of their teaching etc, but equally often the role played by the support staff is taken for granted.“In Muriel we had for decades that invaluable asset of a dedicated partner in delivering the pastoral care and support to our pupils for which Moorfields is renowned.“Not only has she kept generations of children safe in crossing the very busy main road, but she has been that reliable, compassionate point of contact for so many. Through all weathers, Muriel was there to do her remarkable job with the understatement that betokens her caring commitment.“The school is immensely grateful for her decades of service and wish her well in her retirement.”As Mrs Cupples embarks on this next phase of her le away from Moorfields Primary School she was keen to thank all the staff, pupils and parents for their support over the years.“I just want to say thank you to every single one of you who have made my time here so pleasant. Also a massive thanks for all the gts, the cake, the cards and well wishes you all have given me. I’ve made many friendships over the years and I hope they all continue now as I retire.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4423418.jpg--.jpg?1643991652000\n","title":"wrightbus in major recruitment drive for apprentices","story":"LEADING bus manufacturer Wrightbus has announced the recruitment of up to  new apprentices as it gears up for National Apprenticeship Week .The ground-breaking company plans to recruit apprentices in ious roles - including electrical, spray painting, welding, coachbuilding, driveline and engineering. .Wrightbus is supporting its apprenticeship recruitment drive with an open evening on Wednesday February , from -pm, at its Ballymena factory, where people will be able to find out what it is like being a Wrightbus apprentice. Wrightbus sales and business development director, John McLeister, is a huge advocate of apprenticeships. He joined the firm  years ago as an apprentice before working his way up through the ranks.“We’re proud to say our apprentices are playing a key part in driving the business forward,” said Mr McLeister. “We eventually want to have up to  per cent of our workforce on an apprenticeship, via our ious Engineering  Technology Higher Apprenticeship programmes and our general Apprenticeship NI scheme, and this latest recruitment drive will help with that ambition.“They bring ersity, bags of enthusiasm and a fresh approach to problem-solving.”Wrightbus apprentices receive on the job training, working alongside a highly skilled workforce who often act as coaches mentors, along with a college day release programme to back up what they’re learning.Former apprentice Karsten Hall, who started as a design apprentice and now works as a manufacturing engineer, chose a Wrightbus apprenticeship because he wanted to make a start in the world of work.“I wanted a job that provided training and opportunities for progression. I was interested in engineering, so I decided to apply for a Wrightbus apprenticeship,” said Karsten.“From my time on the shopfloor, I gained a lot of hands-on experience with most parts of the build process and a better perspective of how parts are actually assembled and how they can be improved, which helps me in my current role as a manufacturing engineer.”Wrightbus employee Hannah Currie said: “Learning with hands-on experience made a big dference for me, helping with the progression of my career. ‘The experience working with the time-served tradesmen and women, and having such a iety of technology and buses can help you develop so much more knowledge and skills to help you along the way. There are a multitude of opportunities for furthering your career with an apprenticeship.”Sean McAleese, Work Based Learning Managing at Northern Regional College, which works with Wrightbus apprentices, said: “Wrightbus has always been a reliable and trusted employer that has worked closely with the College to develop and implement our apprenticeship programmes at Level , Level  and Higher Level Apprenticeships.“It is great to see the opportunities that have been provided to young people and existing employees who have undertaken an apprenticeship with Wrightbus as well as the high level skills, experience and qualications that they gain. We will continue to partner with the company to identy their training requirements and look forward to strengthening the College’s partnership with Wrightbus in the future.”The National Campaign celebrates the contribution that hundreds of thousands of apprentices make every year to the UK’s economy and encourages more businesses to look to apprenticeships as a solution for recruitment, training, and workforce development. Wrightbus HR Director, Nicola McCloskey, said: “Our apprentices are an invaluable part of our business and we would like to recognise them and thank them for the hard work and effort they put in. They often bring with them new skills and energy, and we’re looking forward to adding to the ranks with this latest round of recruitment.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hauliers representative urges clarity over port checks","story":"Seamus Leheny, Policy Manager at Logistics UK  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSeamus Leheny, Policy Manager at Logistics UK By Rebecca Black, PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Government has been urged to provide clarity following an order from Stormont Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots to stop Brexit checks at Northern Ireland’s ports.Seamus Leheny of Logistics NI said the sector has been plunged into confusion.On Thursday morning lorries were still being received at a Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairschecking facility in Belfast Port.Lorries, including this consignment of tractors are continuing to arrive at the DAERA facility on Duncrue Street hours after the order by Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots to stop Protocol checks pic MlymdYAuDW— Rebecca BlackFebruary , Mr Leheny said businesses received advice to continue to complete paperwork.“There is a lot of confusion and a lot of anxiety with businesses, they weren’t too sure what they had to do, did they still have to fulfil the administration with regards to moving products of animal origin in here,” he told the PA news agency.“Generally the advice this morning from government departments is that you must still complete the paperwork to move goods in here.

study.That figure increased to % in April  during the first lockdown and still remains over %.The research also found that working from home has brought many people, in particular women, back into the labour market, who previously would have been unable to work due to their caring responsibilities.Mr Hetherington said a growing acceptance of home working helped female carersto the labour market.“One of the few good news stories from the pandemic, is the reengaging of those with caring responsibilities, who are a predominantly female cohort, back into the labour market,” he said.“It appears that an increased acceptance of home working by employers is allowing them to manage both their workplace and family responsibilities.”Approximately two-thirds of those working from due to the pandemic want toto the office, but onlyit is combined with remote working flexibility, the research indicated.A further % to % do not want toto the office at all.UUEPC senior economist Dr Eoin Magennis, one of the report’s authors, said attitudes to being office-based were dependent on employees’ personal circumstances.“Overall, the majority of people across all groups want back into the office, at least for some of the week,” he said.“Unsurprisingly young people and the newly employed are expressing the greatest desire toto the office.“There are many reasons for this including the need to continue their learning and development, building their network of peers and also they may not have the most conducive home working environment.”The study suggests that the pandemic-driven trend towards working from home has brought challenges for employers.It concluded that employers must balance the costs and benefits associated with home working.The benefits include recruitment and retention of staff, reduced sickness levels and for some a reduction in overheads.In contrast the costs include the loss of collaboration between staff, reduced opportunities for learning and development and potential well-being issues due to isolation.Dr Magennis said companies need to develop news strategies around working from home.“In general employers have tended to express a preference for a full-timeto the workplace, but also recognise the expectations of their staff and the need to be more flexible,” he said.“As a result, employers now need to develop new approaches to deal with the changes that increased levels of remote working will bring and many are looking for guidance to help them work through those challenges.”Most ReadAs it happened: Paul Givan resigns as

It did not comment when asked about how much of the £.m was intended for bank charges.Mr Lyons said the scheme had been a huge success, with .m cards dispatched, and spending using the cards had boosted the economy by £.m.Related topicsGordon LyonsDepartment for the EconomyUlster Unionist PartyAlan ChambersMore On Gordon Lyons PremiumPoliticians question Invest NI handing out £.m to fossil fuel extraction firmsDress to impress: ASOS seeks new NI tech recruitsStormont minister Lyons ‘confident’ over Boris Johnson’s pledge to replace EU fundingHigh Street scheme payments to , accounts ‘won’t have to be spent local’ PremiumStormont department facing ‘economic disaster’ after losing £m in EU fundingMost ReadAs it happened: Paul Givan resigns as First Minister – DUP’s Donaldson says people must ‘have their say’ as Sinn Fein call for early electionSuzanne BreenOpinionJeffrey Donaldson really had no other choice but his strategy is not without dangerMan found dead at lough was killed as associates didn’t trust him to stay silent, senior detective tells inquestEdwin Poots’ order to halt NI Protocol checks at ports suspended by High Court judgePaul Givan’s resignation: What happens next Top VideosPlayDUP leader: Now is the moment when we say ‘enough’ on Northern Ireland Protocol\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh Paul%Givan w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh Paul%Givan w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayNorthern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan quits in Brexit protocol protestPlayLook inside Northern Ireland#s Game of Thrones Studio TourLatest Northern IrelandLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasBelfastQuiz of the Week Head of NI Civil Service pressed on apology for institutional abuse survivorsIan Jeffers: Springsteen-loving sailor named Northern Ireland’s new victims’ chiefMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageLatestWoman arrested on suspicion of murdering two-year-old boyExtra officers to be deployed to Canadian capital amid lorry protestsWales buoyed by Usain Bolt message as defending champions target flying startFrank MitchellOpinionJim Wells is entitled to hold his heartfelt opinions, but some will see him as yesterday’s manLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areas,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They went through a few phases, allowing their out half to burst through a couple of tackles to score and take a - half time lead.Playing with the conditions in the second half, Ballynahinch started the on the front foot but fell foul of the referee at the breakdown, allowing Lurgan to pin them back in their own .The visiting forwards then went to work, carrying hard and scoring another try.The conversion left the home side  points down, but they hit back almost immediately with some great attacking rugby creating space for Callum McCargo to smash his way over.The game was on the line at this point, but a lack of composure allowed the excellent Lurgan full back to punish weak tackling and score a long range try.Left with a mountain to climb, Ballynahinch once again played some superb rugby with great interplay between centres James Graham and Harvey Campbell creating space for Sam Hamilton to dash for the line.He was stopped short but desperate Lurgan defending saw them receive a yellow card before Matthew McAuley reduced the deficit to five points with a try from a quickly taken penalty.A smash-and-grab victory against  men with only a minute on the clock demanded error-free rugby and after an excellent restart Ballynahinch moved upfield.However a knock-on saw the referee blow his whistle for full time and Lurgan earned a deserved victory.Both sides can be proud and the game was played in a superb spirit with the teams having lunch together in the clubhouse..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Mourne.jpg","title":"Beauty of local landscapes feature in exploration events  ","story":"SEVERAL familiar locations in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Strangford are at the heart of this monthrsquos Northern Ireland Science Festival.There will be a selection of events between February  and  with people across the district encouraged to explore something new as ious venues prepare to play host to a series of stirring events.The so-called STEM celebration mdash which has grown to become the largest of its kind in Ireland mdash boasts more than  events over  days.On February , the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is the venue for the Patrick  The Pagan Hills event which provides an opportunity to follow in the footsteps of both the patron saint and pagan in an exploration of the landscape that Patrick himself encountered when he ed to Ireland nearly , years ago.On February  and , the Strangford Activity Centre is hosting a ldquopaddle back in time kayak adventure to Mahee Island following a traditional smuggling route undertaken by Daft Eddie and the Merry Hearts.There will also be an opportunity to discover ruins of the monastic site of Nendrum, le in the monastery in the Middle Ages and the role played by the Vikings in the Strangford Lough area between the th and th centuries.The Strangford Activity Centre is also hosting ldquopaddle with a purpose on February  and  with participants invited to do their bit for the environment by joining a clean-up of Strangford Lough.And ldquoforaging afloat on February  and  at the same venue sees people joining with the Centrersquos Rory Martin and Andrea and Graham Gannon of Peninsula Kelp for a unique guide to the sights and flavour of the area as spring arrives on the lough and with it an array of seasonal wild food.On February , therersquos an opportunity to discover the wonders of the Mournes at a range of festival events.During the Diamond Rock Walking Tour on February , guide Peter Rafferty will explains how to identy erse rock types and how the Mournes were formed, alongside learning about the amazing geology and history of the area at the Geology on the Rocks event on February .The following day, the Men of Mourne ndash Stone  Steel hiking tour takes place with an opportunity to hear stories of hardship and endurance as participants take to rocky mountain tracks.During the Mourne Stone Walling ndash A Granite Kingdom event, therersquos a chance to experience the beauty and hard graft behind the ,-year-old craft of dry-stone wall building.

Others were, such as decommissioning, but are not being put into action.ldquoIn all of these schemes there is nothing to protect the people employed in the industry. Government must do something to help the plight of these people, said Mr Curran.He complained that these workers are treated as casual labour with no claim to redundancy or national assistance.ldquoThe fishing industry plays a very important part in the economy of Northern Ireland and we must protect it and the people who work in it. Government should set up systems to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, he said.Ulster Unionist, Mr Gerry Douglas, said something has to be done to assist and to at least ensure that the processing industry is retained in Down District.KILLINCHY ndash The  new jobs announced by the Northern Ireland Spinners group as part of a pound.m investment will have no direct impact on its Killinchy factory.A spokesman for the company explained following Thursdayrsquos official announcement that the expansion of the firmrsquos sister factory in Newtownards will have no adverse impact on the Killinchy operation.ldquoThey are sister factories, both concentrating on very similar yarns, he said.ldquoWe have already completed major expansions at Killinchy, virtually replacing all the machinery we had. Killinchy is a very modern mill, as modern as Newtownards, he added.Mr Ray Dinsdale, chief executive of Richards Plc, the Aberdeen-based parent company of Northern Ireland Spinners, said: ldquoThis investment will strengthen the position of Northern Ireland Spinners as the largest United Kingdom spinner of semi-worsted yarns for carpet manufacturers.ldquoOur strategy is based on the expansion of the business into Europe, and the investment will mean that Northern Ireland Spinners will be of the size required to enable it to offer the economies of scale and cost reductions which are required to win business from major carpet manufacturers in these competitive markets, added Mr Dinsdale.CROSSGAR ndash Crossgarrsquos loss has been Bangorrsquos gain with a -job factory picking up an important quality certication.The firm of Dunn and CompanyLtd. was set up in Crossgar in , and it has now picked up the BS quality certication.After four years of trading, the company relocated from its premises in Crossgar to a factory unit based in Balloo industrial estate, Bangor.It manufacturers special purpose valves and precision components for industrial application with  per cent of it business going to the export market.It currently employs  people and has plans for further expansion, explained Mr Ron Dunn, managing director.When asked why the company left Crossgar, Mr Ron Dunn, managing director said: ldquoThere was not enough room in Crossgar.ldquoWe occupied part of the premises of my brother, Sam, but there was just nothing available in the Crossgar area at that time when we employed three of four people.His brother continues his own successful firm manufacturing machine tools on the Saintfield Road, Crossgar.BISHOPSCOURT ndash Planning Service officials have been urged to attend next monthrsquos first bike race at the former Bishopscourt base ndash before reaching a decision on a planning application for a permanent circuit.The plea has been made this week by local SDLP councillor, Mr John Ritchie.ldquoI would expect they will understand the necessity to attend to make an informed judgement on the matter, explained Mr Ritchie.ldquoAfter that date I would hope a decision would not be long delayed.Mr Ritchie said he had read the petition against the proposed race track and seen the comments of those members of the Ballyhornan Development Association who support the proposal. He had also read the details given by the two developers.ldquoThere are a number of issues involved. I understand that there can be up to  meetings without planning permission per year the equivalent of one a month and two a month in two summer months. I would have thought this wasnrsquot unreasonable.SAINTFIELD ndash The centre of Saintfield was sealed off for three hours on Friday afternoon after the discovery of a suspicious package in a telephone box.The area around Crossgar Road and Toddrsquos Hill was closed as army bomb disposal experts carried out an examination of the device.The device which consisted of cassettes, a battery pack and wires, was described as an elaborate hoax and was taken away for examination.NEWCASTLE ndash Mentally handicapped people from all over Northern Ireland will soon be benefitting from a remarkable transformation at Newcastlersquos Ruby House.For the past year passers-by have seen the conversion of the Bryansford Road complex from a row of not-so-attractive seaside resort houses into aspacious and modern residential home which now offers accommodation for  mentally handicapped adults.This year the holiday home is expected to provide upwards of  holidays for mentally handicapped people from all over the Province.The Ruby House Group now has three centres in Newcastle, including a converted house in Main Street and the purpose-built Mary Murray House in the Lawnfield.STRANGFORD ndash A single Strangford Lough management committee is to be launched in the spring by the Environment Department.It will consist of about  representatives of lough users, the community around the lough and those with specialist knowledge of the area.This weekrsquos announcement reflects some of the views expressed by the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association the body which was set up a few years ago in protest against restrictive DoE proposals.The new body will have the development of management proposals for the lough area as its main task.

Connor Kelly had a chance for the visitors, but Celtic Bhoysrsquo goalkeeper, Nathan Curran, was on form and saved.It was a balanced game as both sides had their chances with Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves coming close in the th minute and Celtic Bhoysrsquo Jordan McCoubrey pushing forwarding search of an opportunity in front of the net.Killoughrsquos Gareth George had to be subbed due to an injury on his ankle and Declan Looney came on in the rd minute of the game. Jack McLaughlin had a one on one chance facing Curran, but the ball went straight at the lsquokeeper before it was cleared.The visitors were keeping up the pressure to level the score, with a surging run up the left wing from Looney, who passed across to find Connor Kelly, but again Nathan Curran saved.The second goal of the game came from a similar scenario to the first ndash a lacklustre kick out that found the feet of Jay Gibney again and Celtic Bhoys went two up going into half-time.Two errors by Killoughrsquos goalkeeper saw the hosts leading at half-time and all of the play was going down the right side of the field.Killough signalled their intentions that the game was not over, as Declan Looney looped the ball into the danger zone, and Nathan Curran somehow got his hand to it to push over the bar.Jay Gibney was set for his hat-trick in the th minute when the Killough custodian came out to stop him in his tracks. Gibney managed to manoeuvre round him, but the ball was cleared by Sean Burns. Celtic Bhoys had another chance to go three up, as three of their players from a free-kick stood looking at one another and the chance went a miss.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns played a great ball from the middle of the field to Declan Looney, who found team-mate Daniel Taggart. The striker saw his shot saved, but the rebound fell to Kevin Groves, who finished to bring his side back into the game with  minutes to go.Celtic Bhoys made a couple of substitutes in the next ten minutes, with Sean McMahon going up front and Sean Ferris ping back into midfield.As the clock ticked to the th minute, Killoughrsquos McLaughlin fired in a free-kick to the head of Eamon Gargan.However, man of the match Nathan Curran pushed the ball at full stretch over the bar.In the final five minutes of play it was all attack by Killough. Kevin Groves had a chance which was denied with Declan Looney quickly following up, although there was no way to find the leveller. It was in the last minute that the Killough goalkeeper made a clearance mistake that saw Shaun Megahey score to break Killough hearts.Celtic Bhoys will be very happy with the win, while Killough will count their missed chances. Nathan Curran made the dference in a tight game, and Killoughrsquos young Crangle will have learnt a lot from the contest for the remaining matches of the season.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, R Fitzpatrick, M Rice, C Doherty, B Tracey, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: E Kelly for P Casey, S McMahon for J McCoubrey, S Ferris for Conaill Kerr.Killough FC: J Crangle, R Burns, E Gargan, C Burns, S Og Burns, D Burns, C Kelly, G George, D Taggart, K Groves, J McLaughlin.Subs: D Looney for G George, K Tierney, C Doyle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2020_Wave.jpg","title":"It’s like a little  safe haven here%2C somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged  ","story":"TEARS still spring easily to the eyes of Dympna Kerr, the sister of Columba McVeigh, one of the lsquoDisappearedrsquo victims.Once she begins to talk about her  year-old brother, whose body has never been recovered after he was abducted and murdered by the IRA in , after nearly  years of dealing with his loss the pain remains.Last weekend, the Donaghmore woman left her home in St Helenrsquos in Merseyside to travel to a welcoming building in the coastal village of Killough.At the newly named Wave By The Sea centre in Castle Street, Dympna spent precious time speaking with longstanding friends who are also relatives of the Disappeared. The main dference is that they have been fortunate to locate the bodies of their loved one. Several searches have yet toher brotherrsquos remains to the family but they remain hopeful.ldquoItrsquos like a little safe haven here, somewhere you can come and cry and not get judged. The people you are crying to know why you are crying as they understand, explained Dympna about her lasting need to connect with people with shared experience.ldquoGoing to the Wave house in Belfast is like going home. Itrsquos like getting a hug as soon as you go across the door. And itrsquos the same here as Irsquove already been several times.The help and support of the iniduals who make up the Wave Trauma Centre quietly helps thousands of people like Dympna who have been bereaved, injured and or traumatised by the decades of conflict in Northern Ireland.The building has been provided by the local trustees of The Kinder Project, a charitable Dutch organisation that began its association with Northern Ireland in the s for the education and social welfare of disadvantaged children and young adults.The hostel now provides residential breaks for a maximum of  people, providing rooms for families and iniduals, who use the time to break away from their lives still traumatised and dealing with the physical and emotional aftermath.Counselling and complimentary therapy sessions are offered and other courses are provided by Wave to help those who come, many of whom have never sought help before.Itrsquos the sixth centre around the province that Wave has established, along with r satellite projects, with support funding from the Victims and Support Service, NI Executive, Special EU Programmes Body and charitable donations.One of the Troubles survivors who wished the service had been available locally for him and his family is Killough man Peter Heathwood.Peter knows the benefit of support from Wave. In September  he was left paralysed after a Loyalist gun attack in his Belfast home as he played with his youngest daughter in his living room mdash bullets missing the baby by inches.His attack was witnessed by his late we and two eldest children. His father Hubert died from a heart attack at the scene when he saw his apparently dead son.As a member of the Wave Injured Group, he has campaigned for years for a state pension for people left physically or psychologically injured from the conflict.He has yet to receive his pension, even though he applied for it last autumn.ldquoI had to travel to Belfast night and day and only discovered Wave when I went on to the Victimsrsquo Forum years after my shooting, said Peter.ldquoMy we died at  with a diagnosis of PTSD and suffered with flashbacks. If I had found Wave earlier, I reckon it could have saved her as she could have met other women and shared stories and experiences.ldquoWhen I was shot, I passed out but she saw me lying there with blood pumping out of me, children screaming and my father dying. She could never deal with the fact that she opened the door to the gunmen. But I told her thatshe hadnrsquot have shouted a warning to me, I would have been dead as I was able to get up and slam the door.ldquoEven in this village, there are people who moved from Belfast and a lot of them lost relatives in the Troubles, uncles, fathers, grandfathers and many of them never speak about it. I didnrsquot really talk about it to my own children as you didnrsquot want them to be filled with hate.Peter said that even on holiday when people asked what happened to him, he would say he was injured skiing in the French Alps, a more sanitised version of his attack mdash purportedly in mistake for another man mdash as he enjoyed an evening at home with his family.ldquoWave is a fantastic organisation. We are completely cross-community. Everyone has been hurt by all groups and thatrsquos the great strength of it, said Peter.ldquoI would really encourage anyone who has affected by the Troubles and has never sought help to come along to Wave. Itrsquos never too late to talk.Waversquos chief executive officer, Sandra Peake, says that the new centre will help  people in the immediate area and around  from the district, in addition to providing weekend residential breaks from families across Northern Ireland, Britain and the Irish Republic.ldquoThis wouldnrsquot have been possible without the generosity of the Kinder Project, explained Sandra, who said that the building has been fitted out to reflect a more comfortable family style accommodation.ldquoWe had initially done some work in Downpatrick about  years ago to see what we could have provided but have always been keen to provide a local base, which Kinder has now provided to us.ldquoThe welcome from the people and the shopkeepers of Killough has been brilliant. They seem to know why our visitors are staying here and give them a respectful place and go beyond and above to help them.ldquoSome of the families have enjoyed paddle boarding lessons on the water with children experiencing this type of activity for the first time. One grandmother got to sleep in a bed for the first time in years as she normally sleeps on the couch to let her grandchildren have the bed.Wave By The Sea is much more than a weekend or holiday break.ldquoWe aim to provide a holistic service here for people. It will start with an outreach case worker working with you to establish what your needs are and then that moves us into seeing what we can provide, whether its counselling, physiotherapy, group support and so on, Sandra continued.ldquoSeventy per cent of Waversquos work is service provision, the remainder is trauma education. We have a whole range of short trauma courses now and we hope to run courses her.ldquoThey deal with how trauma affects families, recognising the impact of trauma and how to build resilience, the intergenerational impact and issues such as trauma addiction as we would see people with issues. We also provide trauma education for healthcare professionals and student doctors, nurses, and social workers.She predicts an increase of demand for services as new referrals increased last year in part due to interest in the Injured Pension scheme and the proposed Legacy proposals.ldquoThe majority of people coming to us now have never gone anyway for help. But dferent things are stirring memories. We hope to provide counselling and complementary therapy sessions in Newcastle within a few months.Sandra is recruiting a Health and Wellbeing caseworker who would be based in Killough but would also work in the Newcastle area and stressed that all services were provided on a confidential basis.One of the trustees of the Kinder Project, local man Dr Finbar McCormick, is delighted that the building is being used by Wave.ldquoKinder was a Dutch charity that took children from troubled areas to Holland in the s and then established a local centre in Killough for breaks, he explained. ldquoChildren from other troubled spots like Kosovo and the Balkans were also taken for holidays here over the years.ldquoWith the peace process, the need for the Kinder House just fell away and we were looking for another group to pass it onto so that they could make good use of it.ldquoI happened to meet Peter, who I know, one day while out for a walk and I said to him that we really needed to find another group to use the hostel. Peter said that he would mention it to Wave and that was about  months and Wave has been using it for the last six months.ldquoIt was an excellent choice for us as we really wanted to keep the place going and Wave will continue the same aims that Kinder had.To apply for the caseworker position or to access services, visit Wave www.wavetraumacentre.org.uk or ring   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo set for Croker  ","story":"KILCOO are officially back to back All-Ireland Senior Club Championship finalists after a gruelling clash with Cork side, St Finbarrrsquos, was dramatically settled in extra-time on Saturday.In a thoroughly entertaining contest that had twist after twist, Mickey Moranrsquos men eventually booked their place to contend for the Andy Merrigan Cupwhich has agonisingly eluded the local outfit over the last few years.With the headlines seemingly written in the dying seconds of regulation time, Kilcoorsquos Paul Devlin steadied his frame to send the deciding free between the posts.However, a moment of off-the-ball madness from team-mate Aidan Branagan resulted in a sending off and a further  minutes of added drama.Despite this, the Magpies showed their stamina and experience within this competition and managed to finish comfortably five points adrt from their opponents.The scene was set at a mild Portlaoise venue as sunshine attempted to split through the clouds and past the overshadowing OrsquoMoore Park spectator stands where the Ulster and Munster champions prepared to lock horns.Although the local side won referee Brendan Cawleyrsquos throw-in, it would be The Barrrsquos who would open the scoring from a Cillian Myers-Murray effort.Kilcoo replied rapidly through the reliable Ryan Johnston, who navigated his way past the opposing defence to curl one over the bar to level the tie.The Magpies would soon be soaring when they immediately turned over possession and saw an opportunity for the first goal of the match.Jerome Johnston cleverly spotted his brother, Ryan, and played a quick hand pass into his path where he made no mistake in burying his effort into the top left corner of the net beyond the ing Barrrsquosrsquo custodian, John Kerins.Despite this early blow, the Cork-based outfit remained determined and went on the offensive.Eoin McGreevy took the mark and kicked over before receiving a yellow card for a high tackle on Ryan Johnston.Kilcoorsquos Conor Laverty was rewarded for his tireless work ethic in the form of winning a free, although team-mate Paul Devlin saw his effort uncharacteristically drt wide from what was a very straightforward chance.Colin Lyons was the latest to enter Cawleyrsquos book with  minutes played following a late tackle on Niall Branagan that left the Kilcoo number two worse for wear.Steven Sherlock successfully converted his first of ten frees for The Barrrsquos to bring his side to within a point, but Laverty answered this with a score from play to widen the winning margin once more.St Finbarrrsquos were notably the physically bigger side and it was clear they were initiating a rougher style of play.This was evident after Sherlock again split the posts from a free, when Kilcoorsquos Ceilum Doherty looked to reply and instead was clattered by defender Sam Ryan.This time, Devlin made no mistake with his attempt which would have helped settle his nerves from his earlier miss.Sherlock pointed his third free of the match in retaliation in what was now a tit for tat contest.However, The Barrrsquos managed to swing the tie hugely in their favour when Kilcoorsquos Daryl Branagan forfeited possession close to his goal and the onrushing Eoin Comyns took full advantage.The Barrrsquos number nine quickly passed to team-mate Sherlock, who set up McGreevy for their sidersquos first goal of the match.Despite the efforts of Kilcoo lsquokeeper Niall Kane, McGreevy managed to creep his shot round the custodian to fire his team into the lead minutes before half-time.With seconds to the interval, Denis OrsquoBrien received a yellow to join the growing list of his St Finbarrrsquos team-mates to go into the refereersquos book.As the whistle sounded, both sides engaged in some roughhousing as tensions reached fever pitch.Half time: St Finbarrrsquos - Kilcoo -.The Barrrsquos won the second half throw-in and went on the attack through a surging Sherlock run that resulted in a free - which he duly converted.This sprung The Magpies into action with rising star Shealan Johnston running past three defenders before kicking over the bar for a magnicent solo point.

Tourism currently represents a considerable percentage of Northern Ireland’s GDP, but unsightly rural roads and hedgerows are unlikely to inspire atrip and can damage the perception of our region.”David Brown, Deputy President of Ulster Farmers’ Union said illegal dumping is an increasing issue in rural areas: “Fly-tipping is a scourge on the countryside and one that too many of our farmers have experienced first-hand. Dumping unwanted waste in rural areas is dangerous to human health and harmful to livestock and wildle. In the past, there have been issues where fly-tipping waste polluted watercourses and contaminated land.“When unwanted content is dumped on a farmer’s land, it becomes the responsibility of the landowner to dispose of, while local councils are left to take ownership of waste on public land and highways. This is both costly and time consuming for farmers and ratepayers.“Since the pandemic began, the amount of litter being dumped on farmers’ land has increased, with many rediscovering the outdoors for recreation. I urge all countryside visitors to be more considerate of those living locally, and of animals and to commit to taking their waste home with them.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

consideration stage, when a series of amendments were debated, Mr Poots suggested he will push for the agriculture sector to be exempt from a new net-zero carbon target.Mr Poots hit out at “stupidity” after a majority of MLAs voted for an amendment to his bill on Tuesday night that set a target of net-zero emissions by .An amendment by the Green Party Northern Ireland was passed by  votes to  on Tuesday, increasing Mr Poots’ proposed  reduction target from % to %.Party leader Clare Bailey said the move means Northern Ireland will “no longer be the only region in these islands without a net-zero emissions target”.The bill must also pass through two further Assembly stages before it goes for Royal Assent.Ms Bailey has also proposed an alternative climate change bill, which is also progressing through Stormont in the final weeks before the Assembly is dissolved for fresh elections.Northern Ireland is currently the only part of the UK which does not have its own climate legislation however UK-wide targets do apply to the Province.Mr Poots’ bill, backed by the agri-food industry, has been criticised by environmentalists as not going far enough.Meanwhile, Ms Bailey’s Bill goes further, proposing a  target for reaching net-zero carbon emissions.Mr Poots said he will be looking over the coming days at what further amendments he can table to “limit the harm and damage that will be done to many small farm families in particular across Northern Ireland as a consequence of Assembly Members defying the scientic evidence”.He claimed MLAs have been warned that voting for the net zero  target will result in , families losing their ability to farm and “huge” consequences for , people employed in the sector.“This is going to have a devastating impact on the rural community and this is very much the city folks and Sinn Fein and SDLP ganging up on rural communities, and it is an appalling situation where our Assembly took a decision which is not evidence-based, which is not science-based and is not in line with either the UK’s Climate Change Committee’s recommendations or indeed the IPCC,” he told the BBC.Mr Poots said he intends to press for an exemption for the agriculture sector from the target in the bill as well as a number of other amendments during the final stages.Ms Bailey said she is delighted that the net zero by  target was passed by MLAs but said there are a lot of other issues to look at as well.She said her focus at this time is on securing amendments to Mr Poots’ bill, rather than her own bill, which is yet to have

Boris, as we all know, forgot about the rules he had created for the rest of us and allowed free-for-all parties at No.  during the Covid crisis when we were forced to cower in our homes, only going out masked to the eyeballs and keeping a good distance from anyone we met. Remember when we couldn’t go to the pub or have a dinner out Yes, I doubt I will ever forget it.

Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £..

Holding this office is one that comes with a heavy responsibility and I have often felt the weight of this burden, to do what is right for all our people. “Working together as a five party Executive has its challenges but over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, we made progress and have made a dference that will improve our society. Since June last year the Executive has brought forward  new Bills including legislation that will strengthen the law against sexual offences, modernise the adoption process for children that need a family, tackle climate change and help save lives through organ donation.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To give people hope, to improve our communities, to make a dference for the betterment of all.“During this time we have taken over  key policy decisions and published strategies that will underpin future policy direction in areas that have included support for people struggling to meet the costs of living by extending welfare mitigations and the energy support scheme, ending Violence Against Women and Girls and providing refuge for Afghans fleeing persecution. We are driving forward the economy with the first City Growth deal signed for the Belfast Region worth over £bn that will create thousands of jobs and only last week we published Northern Ireland’s Investment Strategy. “All of the progress made has been in the context of managing a public health crisis as the Covid pandemic challenged us in ways that nobody expected when the virus first arrived nearly two years ago. I have been humbled by the sacrice and commitment of everyone who has gone the extra mile to get us through this testing time. Sadly thousands of people lost their lives and people have suffered in many ways but better days are ahead and we can look forward once again hopeful that springtime is coming and summer is on the way.“I am a committed devolutionist. I believe we as public servants to the people that elect us are best placed to find solutions to the many challenges we face by working together. What makes Northern Ireland great is the people and the values we share. Decency, compassion, respect, tolerance, helping others, improving our communities and with these shared values we can embrace our dferences when we show generosity towards the ersity that enriches the fabric of our society. The ability to stretch ourselves as politicians and go beyond what we find comfortable is what we need to dowe are to fulfil the potential of living in a truly shared and united society. I believe we can do that with leadership that transcends any one particular identity. “Our institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom Government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol. “The consent principle is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will soon be able to give that consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through a resolution to the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point. “I want to thank Edwin for giving me this opportunity and Jeffrey who asked me to continue in the role when he became Party Leader. Most of all I want to thank my family, especially my we Emma. It is often those we are close to in our families that feel the pressure, even more so than those of us in front line politics.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Great cities like Glasgow, Belfast, Swansea and Manchester, and proud towns from Aberystwyth to Armagh, to Bangor and Yeovil, have huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back.“Our ambitious plan to unite and level up the whole UK seeks to end that historic injustice and call time on the postcode lottery.”But he added: “We will only succeedall layers of government – UK, devolved, and local – work together.“We have seen through the success of the vaccine roll-out what we can achieve when we pull together.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I enjoy long walks to the shops, watching football and have made new friends.”Martin Hill, deputy head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit, said: “We believe this is the first time a modern slavery victim has been able to give pre-recorded evidence for a court in England or Wales.“It allowed an exceptionally vulnerable victim to tell his own story of what happened in his own way and ultimately contributed towards this guilty plea.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Vulnerable man made to live in horse box and squalid shed for years article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon“Again, they were not up to any misbehaviour, or even working out together they were working out separatelyand simply put out becauseof their age.“I understand that is our policy at the moment but I think it is unfair on - year- olds, particularly boys, whose mental health really benefits from gym use and who absolutelydo not want to go to the gym with their mum, dad, auntie or uncle.“Many of these people will be in school to pm by the time they get home, fed and back out again, not being able to access the gym in the evenings, without an adult present, is a policy that is flawed...“Evenwe were to say, perhaps, that for three nights a week under s could attend the gym later into the evening, I would really appreciatethat could be discussed at the next leisure and community services committee meeting in February.”Seconding the proposal, Lord Mayor, Alderman Glenn Barr, asked that the policy bereviewed across the borough, not just at South Lake, while a likewise supportive Councillor Peter Lavery said he had receivedsimilar reports.“I am not sureit is something that has been more rigorously enforced in recent weeks or months but certainlythis did not seem to be an issue previously,” said Mr Lavery. “I think it is unfair on young boys, and girls as well, who are missing out on the social element of going to the gym as a result, so I would support having a wider look at this.“We want as many people using the gym as possible andyoung people want to go and use our health and wellbeing facilities I think we should be all for that.”Not one who frequented gyms very often, he said, Councillor Mark Baxter noted nonetheless that, in South Lake, the borough had “probably the best gym in the whole country” and the council ought to be actively promoting it.“I assume these teenagers are paying for the service, so I am a wee bit astounded that they are not allowed into the gym unaccompanied,” he added.Unaware of the policy, Councillor Margaret Tinsley asked why it was in place.Councillor Darryn Causby could think of no logical reason why such a policy existed.“I would be keen to understand who made the decision and why it was made,” he said.“If there is a safeguarding issue in the evening it would be the same, I would imagine, during the day.“I am a wee bit concerned we are in this position at times the gym is extremelybusy and it is encouraging to see so many people using it and we should be encouraging its use rather than prohibiting it.”Head of leisure and community services, Jonathan Hayes, confirmed the policy did exist and he promised a report would be prepared for members of the leisure and community services committee ahead of its next meeting.Read More Read MoreBleary planning application

The move means that deputy First Minister, Sinn Fein’s Michelle ONeill, also loses her position as the two roles are a joint office shared between Stormont’s two biggest parties. Thereforeone leader resigns, the other leader’s resignation is also triggered. It is understood that the Executive will continue toas other ministers will remain in place to run their departments. However, as there would be no First or Deputy First Minister in place, no new decisions could take place. That would mean that the current COVID- restrictions, including the wearing of masks would remain in place for the forseeable. Similarly, an energy scheme which would see , people receive a pound grant would be thrown into jeopardy while there is doubt over whether a scheduled apology for victims of historical sexual abuse will be made. Legislation which is due to be completed at Westminster next week will allow the Assembly to continue for between six and nine months without an election. Speaking at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Mr Givan said the “institutions are being tested once again and the delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew’s agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom government and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol”. He added, “The consent principal is a cornerstone of the Belfast Agreement, and it is my earnest desire that all sections of the community will be able to give consent to the restoration of a fully ing Executive through the resolution of the issues that have regrettably brought us to this point.” Mr Givan said that being First Minister had been the “privilege of my letime”. He added that when he began in politics  years ago he “never expected to serve the people of Northern Ireland as first minister”. The Lagan Valley MLA said that “over the past eight months, working with the deputy First Minister, we have made progress that will improve our society. “ Earlier, Sinn Feacutein president Mary Lou McDonald said “we cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a ing executive”, adding that her party would not facilitate this. “In the absence of a ing executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say,” she said. “We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre.” Speaking at the same press conference, Ms ONeill said the actions of the DUP were a deliberate act of harm”. Meanwhile, UUP leader Doug Beattie has said that the DUP have shown no leadership whatsoever. If theres changes to the protocol in the coming weeks or months, itll be because of the hard work done behind the scenes to get those through negotiations. It will not be done by a minister resigning from their post. The DUP leadership’s actions “represent a gross betrayal of people in Northern Ireland,” according to SDLP leader Colm Eastwood. Resigning from government when people are struggling to provide for their families, heat their homes and deal with the cost of living tells you all you need to know about the DUP - for them the party will always come first and ordinary people come last, he added. People deserve better than a choice between bad government or no government. As for the Alliance Party, their deputy leader, Stephen Farry, said Mr Givan’s resignation would be “an act of huge harm”, adding that it was “a self-destructive approach by the DUP”. On the other hand, Jim Allister, the leader However, the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voiceparty, which is not in the power-sharing coalition, said Mr Givans resignation would be better late than never. Its the price of Stormont implementing a protocol that day-by-day is dismantling the union, Jim Allister said. It is a price no unionists can pay or should have ever had to pay. Speaking following the resignation of the first minister, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the party had reminded the UK government of its promises. This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early  and have participated in the political institutions since then, he said. I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Irelands position in it.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffedbeddece   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adcbaacfdabde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
