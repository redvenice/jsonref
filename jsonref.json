As for the reports about his lovers, I don\u0027t want to know about this part of him. It was his job.\u0027         Cohen\u0027s daughter Sophia Ben-Dor (above) told MailOnline that she was upset by the portrayal of her spy father in the mini seriesCohen became Israel\u0027s most celebrated spy after being recruited by the country\u0027s intelligence agency, Mossad, while working in Tel Aviv as a clerk with an insurance company.His cover story was that he was Kamel Amin Thaabet, an extremely successful Syrian businessman.Telling his family he was employed as a furniture buyer for the Ministry of Defence, Cohen\u0027s espionage career began when he moved to Buenos Aires and made the contacts necessary to set himself up in Damascus.He moved to Syria in 1961 and worked his way up the country\u0027s elite, sending military secrets home in coded transmissions to his homeland. His intelligence from behind enemy lines was instrumental in Israel\u0027s defeat of Syria in the Six Day War.During a top secret tour of the Golan Heights — one of the most important Syrian military sites on the border with Israel — Cohen offered to fund the planting of eucalyptus trees in key places to give troops shade and hide military fortifications from the Israelis.         In 1961 Cohen left his family in Israel and set himself up in Buenos Aries to provide a cover story for his final destination in Syria. Newly-released Mossad files show pictures of the apartment where undercover agent lived at 375 Lavalle Street in the Argentine capital          The block of flats in at 375 Lavalle Street, Buenos Aries, looks remarkably similar today to how it looked when Cohen was living there for a short period at the beginning of the Sixties         While building his cover story in Buenos Aries, Cohen would often meet Syrian officials at Cafe Artaud as he posed as a wealthy exporter of furniture. Pictured: Mossad files show how the cafe looked while the secret agent operated thereThe Syrians thought it was a great idea and readily agreed. But after Cohen shared intelligence with his bosses, the trees ended up being used years later by the Israelis to target underground Syrian bases.Cohen became so trusted in Syria that at one point he was even offered a senior role in the country\u0027s Defence Ministry.But his incredible haul of military secrets came to an abrupt end in 1965, when Syrian counter-intelligence decided to smoke out any spies in their country.They called in spooks from Russia\u0027s feared KGB security services, who brought specialist radio equipment to the Middle East which was able to pinpoint secret broadcasts being made inside Damascus.         Cohen\u0027s cache of intelligence from behind enemy lines in Damascus where he worked his way up in the Syria\u0027s social elite was instrumental in Israel\u0027s defeat of Syria in the Six Day War. Pictured: Cohen (second from the right) is seen working undercover in Beirut         Cohen was selected by Mossad for his mission because he spoke Arabic and his appearance could pass for Syrian. Pictured: A postcard written in French sent from Istanbul signed off with his code name Menashe         Cohen sent coded transmissions and photos back to Israel, giving the security services Syrian military secrets. Pictured: A photo taken covertly by Cohen of a Syrian military paradeThe signal was coming from Cohen\u0027s home. When armed men kicked in his door to arrest him, they astonishingly found the deeply trusted Cohen in the middle of making a secret code transmission.Cohen had his fingernails ripped out and was hanged in Damascas Square. His body was covered with anti-Zionist slogans and left hanging for six hours.His body has never been returned home despite pleas from his family to bury him in Tel Aviv. Sophia gave MailOnline newly-released photos from Mossad files that show him during surveillance training in Tel Aviv in 1961.She also showed photos of a cafe in Buenos Aries where he met Syrian diplomats and where he lived in the Argentina capital.Sophia said she was surprised that Sacha Baron Cohen made no attempt to contact the family prior to filming.\u0027I think Sacha could have learned more if he had met me,\u0027 she said. \u0027But perhaps then it would have been another series. More accurate and maybe more deep.\u0027She said the star bore a startling resemblance to her father despite being 6ft 2in when the super spy was a diminutive 5ft 6in.She added: \u0027Netflix used my father\u0027s life. But many people use him. He is a symbol in Israel and everybody I know uses him for their own reasons.\u0027There is a public image of Eli Cohen and I try to find my own father, the real person, because everyone colours it with their own agenda.\u0027The real man she fondly remembers, she said, was very different from the Netflix character.\u0027He had a sense of humour,\u0027 she said. \u0027He was playful. He was a very, very responsible man. He was not brave like it shows in the series.\u0027He had very good artistic taste. He liked to dress well and look very nice. He was very loyal both to the Mossad and to his Arab friends, not disclosing their names even under torture.         Cohen, played by the Ali G and Borat creator, hosted orgies in his Damascus flat for Syria\u0027s rich and powerful and pretended to drink while they spilled all of their military secrets          Cohen told his wife Nadia that he had got a job as a furniture buyer with the Syrian Ministry of Defence to explain why he would be spending so much time away from her, travelling overseas       Cohen\u0027s daughter Sophia said that the family were unhappy with his portrayal as a flamboyant womaniser and accused Netflix of sensationalising her father\u0027s story. Pictured: Sacha baron Cohen is arrested in the series when he is unmasked as a Mossad spy working in Syria\u0027He was very lovable. They loved him. He was quiet. He was a very solitary man in his personality. The outgoing man was an act. He liked people but he preferred to be alone.          Cohen\u0027s watch was recently returned to his family, who continue to lobby Syria to have his body repatriated to his homeland\u0027The complexity of his character I didn\u0027t see in the series. He was shown as taking risks and having gymnastic abilities that he didn\u0027t have at all.\u0027Ms Cohen, the oldest of her father\u0027s three children who was four when he was executed, said he would spoil her with dolls, dresses and stuffed animals whenever he returned home.She says she doesn\u0027t recognise the way her father was portrayed in the drama, scaling walls to steal documents and putting his cover at risk.\u0027Netflix wanted to show my father like James Bond. But he didn\u0027t spend a lot of money. We think that maybe they caught him because he didn\u0027t live like a rich man in Syria. It was strange that his house was very modest.\u0027Mr Cohen\u0027s wife, Nadia, now 84, was upset because she is portrayed as a poorly-paid maid in the series when in real-life she had trained to be a nurse.Sophie said: \u0027We weren\u0027t a rich family but we were not poor like they showed us. To be honest, my mother felt insulted.\u0027         Cohen\u0027s incredible haul of military secrets came to an abrupt end in 1965, when he was caught red-handed sending transmissions to Israel from his apartment. Pictured: Cohen with two un-named defendants at his espionage trial in Damascus ten days before he was put to death        Cohen had his fingernails ripped out and was hanged in Damascas Square. His body was covered with anti-Zionist slogans and left hanging for six hours (pictured)Before the drama was filmed, Netflix producers showed the family a draft of the script.\u0027We didn\u0027t want them to produce it at all,\u0027 she said. \u0027But our lawyers said that against Netflix we didn\u0027t have a chance.\u0027So we spoke to the director and negotiated with him to change little things, knowing that he would keep the plot as he liked it to be.\u0027My father never killed anyone so Netflix agreed to change a scene where he pushed a man off a balcony. And they agreed not to show him naked in orgy scenes.\u0027The whole thing hurt us and we would have preferred it was never made,\u0027 she added.

No figure in public life has a greater capacity for patience nor had that forbearance tested more often than the Queen       The Queen has always nobly strived — and succeeded — to be above politics. And, at the time of the referendum, Buckingham Palace was at great pains to stress that it was a matter for the Scottish people, not the monarch, who would accept the result whichever way it went.Privately, of course, the Queen, who has a very personal, life-long love of Scotland, as well as being the nation’s head of state, was deeply concerned at the possibility of a split in the union.It was while staying with the Queen at Balmoral less than two weeks before the independence vote that the Cameron plan to ask her to help took shape.Shaken by a Sunday Times poll putting the Yes campaign ahead, he says there was a ‘mounting sense of panic’, and urgent conversations began between advisers in Downing Street and at the Palace.He recalled ‘not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch’.Seven days later, while speaking to a well-wisher outside Crathie Kirk — the Balmoral parish church — the Queen urged people to ‘think very carefully about the future’.         The Queen has always nobly strived — and succeeded — to be above politics. Pictured here with David Cameron outside No 10         The Queen at her audience with Prime Minister David Cameron in her sitting room in BalmoralIt was four days before the vote and became one of the main talking points of the campaign.Reacting to David Cameron’s decision to bring it up now, royal sources say ‘it serves no one’s interests’ for conversations between a PM and the Queen to be made public. ‘It makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive,’ they added.In the inscrutable language of Court circles, this is about as close to screaming blue murder.The Queen, who is currently at Balmoral, has been closely following developments.The timing of Mr Cameron’s misguided disclosure is so crucial. It is an unwelcome distraction at a time when the monarch is already, controversially, at the centre of the bitter Supreme Court battle between Remainers and the Government over the proroguing of Parliament and whether Boris Johnson lied to the Queen about it.Nor was this the first time that Mr Cameron has been indiscreet.In the aftermath of the Scottish vote, he let slip how the Queen had ‘purred down the line’ when he phoned her with the result.On that occasion, she kept her feelings to herself.         David Cameron, son Arthur and daughter Nancy when they heard the results from the 2014 Scottish referendumIs it any wonder that, as someone who has herself stuck correctly to the conventions of absolute silence on conversations with her 14 different prime ministers, she is unnerved by the way these courtesies are no longer always observed?For decades, the Queen could rely on the diplomatic good sense of the holders of her kingdom’s most important political position. But the rot set in with Tony Blair, whose autobiography trampled over the protocol of omerta that normally applies to PM and monarch.He related conversations in detail, including the strained dealings that followed the death of Princess Diana.He also described at length his visits to Balmoral, an experience he described as a combination of the ‘intriguing, the surreal and the utterly freaky’.They were, he said, a ‘bit of a horror’ made bearable by the generous drinks poured before dinner that acted like ‘true rocket fuel’.He also said the Queen, on occasion, exhibited ‘hauteur’ — and he famously disclosed how, on his very first audience after the 1997 election, she had told him: ‘You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born.’At the time, Mr Blair was accused of a gross discourtesy, particularly for ignoring the unwritten rule that formal audiences between premier and Queen are entirely private, with no note-taking.Boris Johnson breached protocol, too, following his first meeting with Her Majesty as Prime Minister.No sooner had he left the Palace than he was overheard telling Downing Street staff that she had amusingly told him she didn’t know why anyone would want to be Prime Minister.Although it undoubtedly demonstrated that the Queen has a dry sense of humour, Mr Johnson’s comment was a serious error.Of course, Brexit has meant problems, too.Three years ago, Michael Gove was named as the source of a red-top tabloid newspaper story that claimed the Queen backed Britain leaving the EU.It was based on an apparent conversation with MPs several years earlier in which she allegedly said: ‘I don’t understand Europe.’ It was reported that she spoke the words with ‘venom and emotion’.The same paper also reported an alleged exchange between the Queen and then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over lunch at Windsor Castle.It claimed she told the pro-Europe Clegg that the EU was heading in the wrong direction.Clegg denied the story, and the Palace made a formal complaint about the newspaper’s ‘misleading’ and ‘distorted’ headline, which was ruled to be inaccurate.Aides will pray that admonishing David Cameron will ensure that the normal diplomacy between Sovereign and Prime Minister can return.In the partisan and febrile atmosphere currently engulfing politics, however, that seems a forlorn hope."},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE David Camerons school pals dont recall maggots menu","story":"Share this article   Viscount Thurso made a startling declaration at the London Diarists’ Lunch this week. ‘I’m the only person here to have been seen publicly naked,’ John Thurso boomed to fellow guests.

This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15.

Texas Ranger Darren Matthews, who was introduced in 2018’s Bluebird, Bluebird, is in many ways a classic noir protagonist. His own mother is blackmailing him he’s in constant danger of “falling off the cliff of his own morality” his marriage and sobriety are teetering on the same edge. But in Locke’s brand of noir, Matthews also happens to be a black cop for whom black lives matter, grappling with the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election and marvelling daily “with befuddled anger at what a handful of scared white people could do to a nation”. In a subplot carried over from Bluebird, Bluebird, he has landed himself in hot water after covering for an elderly black man suspected of murdering a racist petty criminal in the course of running him off his land because “his own read of history told him a black man should have the right to his own fear. Otherwise, he would forever be dying because of someone else’s.”When Levi King, the nine-year-old son of an Aryan Brotherhood captain, vanishes on Caddo Lake in east Texas, the investigation brings Matthews to an enclave in Marion County named Hopetown, settled in the 19th century by a group of slaves who swam to freedom and still occupied by their descendants more than a century later: “part of a larger historical story of what black freedom looks like”. A band of squatters linked to the Brotherhood and led by Levi’s stepfather, Gil Adamson, have set up a ramshackle trailer park on its borders, and clashes between the rightful residents and these neo-Nazi interlopers with whom they are forced to live cheek by jowl have resulted in an uneasy standoff.A seam of southern gothic runs through the novel: the swampy moss-wreathed lake that seems to have swallowed a boy whole, his mother’s febrile grief, the fading antebellum glory of the hotel where Matthews is put up by the local police force, allegedly haunted by a slave mistress who died by her own hands. But it’s men such as Adamson who are the real nightmare. When Matthews arrives at his home he refuses to allow him inside, unable to see past the black man to his badge: “I don’t give a shit ’bout the star on his chest.” He’s the kind of person whose toxic nostalgia has led him to flank his front door with racist figurines waving Confederate flags, and of whom Locke writes: “The country seemed to grow them in secret like a nasty fungal disease that spread in the dark places you don’t ever dare look.”The action shifts between Hopetown and nearby Jefferson, where we encounter the quietly slapping water of the bayou as well as a thick, insidious bog of racism, and where the missing boy’s wealthy grandmother presides over the town behind a facade of gentility. Citing examples of black people she has welcomed into her home, she can get no further than her maid and her driver. The requisite plot thickener is supplied when it’s revealed that the last person to see Levi was a cantankerous black man named Leroy Page, Hopetown’s oldest resident, who periodically rustles up gun-toting horseback patrols as a kind of vigilante response to the encroaching threats. When the investigation inevitably narrows in on Page, the needle on Matthews’s wavering moral compass swings even more wildly, as he reckons with his own “blind spots when it came to black folks”, and his instinct to give Page the benefit of the doubt.Heaven, My Home is a propulsive and compelling novel, worthy of comparisons to Walter Mosley. The story whips along towards a resolution so neat and tidy that it skates very close to cliche, but Locke’s exploration of Matthews’s predicament digs deep into the tension between “the impulse to police crimes against black life and to protect black life from police”. It is buttressed by passages of gorgeous lyricism, with loving, elegiac evocations of Texas set alongside extended meditations on displacement, reconciliation and forgiveness, and on what “home” means in a place where it’s an idea you can’t “exactly touch”. In some scenes there’s an old African American spiritual playing in the background, an anthem of resistance from which the novel takes its name: “I make heaven my home, I shall not be moved.” Locke suggests that being black in America has meant a constant, disorienting search for terra firma, fighting to claim some piece of the “fields and prairies that we once tilled until our backs broke and bled”, and that this feeling has returned with terrible urgency, or perhaps that it never left.• Sara Collins’s The Confessions of Frannie Langton is published by Penguin.Heaven, My Home is published by Serpent’s Tail (£14.99).

She had died from heart failure. It was later revealed that Sado had logged 159 hours and 37 minutes of overtime at work in the month before her death. Sado’s death was officially designated as a “death from overwork”.So common are cases of people dying from overwork in Japan that the country has a special term for it, karoshi. The first case of karoshi was recorded in 1969 according to government data, Japan had 190 deaths from overwork in 2017.Earlier this year the Japanese government introduced a law limiting legal overtime work to 45 hours a month, with an extension of up to 100 hours a month in busy periods for a maximum of six months a year. But many remain doubtful it will rein in Japan’s toxic overwork culture.“There remains considerable pressure on employees to prove themselves by long hours,” says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Tokyo’s Temple University. “As long as this samurai work ethic prevails, it’s hard to be optimistic.”But as with the case of Japan and other cities, working long hours does not necessarily equate to high productivity. According to the UBS study, Mexico City is the world’s third-hardest working city, with the average worker clocking up 2,622 hours per year. However, Mexico is the least productive of 38 countries listed in data from OECD — managing $18.8 (£15) in GDP for every hour worked. Ireland, the most productive, creates $84 in GDP for every hour. And with an annual average of 1,856 hours, workers in Ireland’s capital, Dublin, work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts in Mexico City.But despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its 2019 UK Working Lives Study, and found that one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours.“Employers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,” says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. “In fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.”Kinman also warns that chronic, long working hours can have a major impact on mental and physical health because people’s resources are drained and not adequately replenished by rest.With job opportunities a common pull factor for people moving to urban areas, the problem of overwork can be particularly acute in cities. How can a better work-life balance be established?According to the Kisi study, Singapore has the highest percentage of people working more than 48 hours a week. “Singapore is overall thought to be a very liveable city, but the analysis showed that citizens have one of the highest stress scores,” says Bernhard Mehl, the company’s CEO.“After publishing this study we’ve had cities calling us to understand what they can do better, and it’s really about comparing yourself to the average to see where your deficits are that could drive a change-focused agenda.” In the case of Singapore, Mehl suggests that “offering more programmes around mental health and shaping the conversation around stress relief might be a good idea”.In more broad terms, Kinman says it is critical to set boundaries. “Switching off from work (physically and mentally) is essential to ensure mental and physical health and a happy and fulfilling personal life,” she says.“Plan holidays and short breaks through the year in advance use mindfulness to help you switch off practice self-compassion and prioritise self-care.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/742b7b86280293f17435016dd8c086d75dd622c9/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0b2fbbc07a65b74566af8a1d74838ae","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From Ad Astra to Antony Gormley, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysby  Lyndsey Winship Michael Billington ,  Andrew Clements,  Michael Cragg,  John Fordham,  Jonathan Jones,  Andrew Pulver, and Lyndsey WinshipDirector James Gray has gone from outsider to bona-fide commercial auteur following the surprise success of adventure yarn The Lost City of Z.

Or will family loyalty triumph?The big-screen spin-off of Julian Fellowes’s hit TV series has turned into a solid-gold box office hit, as if anyone doubted it. But it’s not likely to go down in the annals of great cinema: not only has the big screen shown up its fawning approach to the upper classes, it’s also evident that few risks were taken with the format, with a highly televisual approach to narrative and tone.This high-trash thriller – about a team of strippers scamming their boneheaded Wall Street clientele – would appear to have saved the American summer box office how ironic is that?

The film will be shown to heads of state and the UN’s climate and bioersity chiefs in New York.“Right now, we are ignoring natural climate solutions,” said Thunberg. “We spend 1,000 times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on nature-based solutions. This is your money, it is your taxes, and your savings.”“Nature is a tool we can use to repair our broken climate,” said Monbiot, an author and  journalist who founded a Natural Climate Solutions campaign earlier this year. “These solutions could make a massive difference, but only if we leave fossil fuels in the ground as well.”Shyla Raghav from Conservation International, which helped fund the film, said: “The fact is, we simply will not succeed in avoiding climate breakdown without nature.”Global carbon emissions must be halved in the next decade to avoid serious impacts from global heating, but they are still rising. It is therefore near certain that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere, and technology such as burying CO2 underground has not been demonstrated at scale.In the film, Monbiot says: “There is a magic machine that sucks carbon out of the air, costs very little, and builds itself. It’s called a tree.” A recent scientific analysis concluded that growing billions of trees across the world is the single biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis, though coal, oil and gas burning must also end.“We are living in the beginning of a mass extinction and our climate is breaking down,” says Thunberg in the film. “But we can still fix this – you can still fix this.”“It’s simple,” she says. “We need to protect, restore, and fund.” That means protecting tropical forests that are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute, she said, restoring the large areas of the planet that have been damaged and stopping the funding of things that destroy nature and instead paying for activities that help it.The film’s producer, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: “We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8da6688842d961f9923cb1bd3b4795bedff596/0_0_1200_409/master/1200.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=aeacb6318e3ca39b84b15e9ed9003a15 960w","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/487fd03a2e799413468e216e45bda53ceb167b3e/146_134_1756_1054/master/1756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daedb164d027505c066f661160869577","title":"circular hairstyles shrinking sliders fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekFabric metamorphoses First tulle, now gingham, which Vogue says is “full of sassy promise”.Stylish seniors Instagram account @gramparents catalogues well-dressed older people: expect bucket hats and chinos.Circular hairstyles Timothée Chalamet, Celine Dion and Charlize Theron: it’s official, the bowl cut is back, back, back.

Here’s your 2019 updateLooking back, the late 20th century looks like an enviably straightforward place to live. There’s probably a touch of rose-tinted hindsight here, I suppose (imagine having to get around using only paper maps, and eating iceberg lettuce in every salad) but at least you knew where you were.Work, for instance. Work had a fixed geographical location and a time window. Work was desks and staplers and telephones and fountain pens. You had to spend all your time sitting still at the desk, so that the people at your work knew you were at work, and so that other people in their other workplaces could phone you, on the phone that didn’t move from your desk. And so you knew what to wear. A pencil skirt and court shoes were perfect when your longest journey was walking to the kettle point and back. There was little pressure to “refresh your work look” when your office surroundings, from colleagues to pot plants, remained largely the same from year to year.If we are confused and discombobulated about what to wear to work in 2019, it is because we don’t really know what work is supposed to look like any more. Freelancing, remote working, technology and office culture has fundamentally changed the way work looks and feels. Work is paper-free hotdesking and laptops in cafes and lunch al desko. Work is emails on your phone at bedtime and video meetings. It is office politics choreographed through social media rather than the watercooler. A pencil skirt does not work for walking meetings, nor is it your friend if you have to gather in “break-out areas” with low-level seating.And yet our iconography of workwear for women remains rooted in the 80s and 90s. It is Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, and Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. It is stuck in the era when Tina Brown first ruled New York and Ally McBeal was an up-and-coming Boston lawyer. It is trouser suits and shoulder pads and handbags built to house a Filofax. None of which is appropriate any more, but we have nothing with which to replace it. The last major storyline in the narrative of what we wear to work was Dress Down Friday, which felt like progress, but was essentially just a shrug of tacit admission that no one has a clue what to put on any more.In many workplaces these days, anything goes. Which, of course, is the hardest dress code of them all, because it doesn’t actually mean that anything goes, – it means a minefield of unspoken rules to be navigated. If you wear, say, a brightly coloured trouser suit instead of institutionalised black, will people think you have a creative and original mind, or will they think you are a fundamentally unserious person? Because those judgments matter, whether you like it or not. If you wear trainers with your trouser suit will your colleagues admire your fashion sense, or wonder if you forgot to change your shoes in the ladies? And so on and so forth. When you are standing in front of your wardrobe in the morning with the clock ticking down on the departure board in your head and these questions running through your mind, anything goes is not helpful at all.So I’m not here to tell you that you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in, because (a) it’s not true and (b) it’s not useful. We don’t need rules, but we do need a plan. Right? Let’s go to work.High heels at work are a bit toxic these days, no? It goes without saying that no woman should be forced by her employer to wear high heels if she doesn’t want to, and that it is utterly ludicrous that we are still having this debate but here we are. Two years ago, the British government rejected calls to outlaw mandatory high-heel policy. Japan, where a heel policy is commonplace, is the latest battleground, with a vocal #KuToo campaign – a pun on kutsu, meaning shoe, kutsuu, meaning pain, and #MeToo. Once you recognise how high heels have been weaponised against women in the workplace it’s harder to see them in a purely benign light, as fun and empowering. I’ve worn high heels for decades and I don’t find them painful but these days I wear flats most of the time, because heels can look a bit out of touch.But here’s the thing – you’re not going to like this, but it’s true – knee-length hemlines rarely work with flat shoes, and nor do floor-scraping trousers. Those silhouettes were built on a mannequin in heels. There are exceptions, obviously. If you are Stella Tennant you can wear a knee-length kilt and a brogue and look amazing, but on most of us norms it is not an elegant silhouette. Flat shoes work best with midi-length skirts, or with trousers that end at the ankle bone or a bit higher.A flat shoe shouldn’t make you look unsophisticated, or as if you haven’t made an effort. So instead of plain ballet pumps, go for loafers, or flat Mary Janes, or flat pumps with a narrow front V which gives them a little more gravitas. Trainers need to be spotless (most can be machine washed, on cold). Black tights with flat black shoes can look a bit school uniform, so if it’s only your ankle showing, get some trainer-liner socks and show a few inches of skin instead.Many women equate dressing smartly with wearing tight-fitting clothes. Give a woman an intimidating meeting or presentation to dress for and her default will often be to vacuum-pack herself into a tight dress or suit. I suppose there are issues here about what women are valued for, stirred into a primal instinct of what to wear in order to hold an audience’s attention. Anyway, I think it’s worth recognising as a pitfall: if what you are wearing is so tight that the only male equivalent is midlife crisis cycling gear, then consider a rethink.I am not suggesting we waft around the office in kaftans. (I love kaftans with a passion and plan to spend my entire dotage in them but they are not workwear.) There is certainly something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work – it just doesn’t have to be a newsreader-esque hourglass dress. I am very into the trouser shape I’m calling a Mom-trouser: high-waisted, with a buttoned waistband and wide or tapered (but not sausage tight) legs. This works really well with a shirt or blouse tucked in. A loose or pleated midi skirt becomes very purposeful-looking if you wear it with a structured blazer.You can be taken seriously without being a joyless automaton. Looking too officey is very ageing, when younger people in the workplace tend to dress more casually. And anyway, we spend a lot of time working, and what you wear is one way to alter the mood of your day. Print and colour are your friends. This time of year, before we get mired in the practicalities of freezing temperatures and wet pavements, is a good time to bring some fun to what you wear. Now, while our getting-dressed time slot still happens in daylight in a civilised fashion, before darkness descends and we are groping inside wardrobes in the pitch black, is the moment to experiment. When you look at outfits in fashion shoots and ad campaigns, don’t look at the price in the credits stare at the outfit and think about what you’ve already got in your wardrobe that has a similar vibe. It might be the same silhouette in a different print, or vice versa – but if you get an idea, then try it out.There are lots of ways you can add fun to what you wear to work. Colour is fun. Leopard print is possibly a bit too fun for some workplaces, but stripes are great. Florals can be very work-friendly on black backgrounds, and florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, in the modern fashion calendar, which is, everywhere. Jumpsuits and boilersuits put a spring in your step, mentally as well as physically – something about the mobility of a jumpsuit makes it seem like an upbeat thing to wear.Not all fashion is created equal, when it comes to workwear. Fashion this autumn, for instance, includes many trends, some of which are well suited to wearing to the office (70s bourgeois is a slam dunk, being both smart and slick but also fashiony), and others which are perhaps less so. Feathers, for instance. Bucket hats. “Ugly sister” shoulders. Microbags.Trends that will work this season include shirtdresses: try them over knee-length or ankle-length boots, or layered over a polo neck, if they feel too summery otherwise. Also, try a blazer with a belt over the top I am very much feeling this as an intermediary level before the time comes to wear an actual coat.I’m talking about your coat, and your tote bag. The image in your head of what you wear to work is the clothes you are wearing once you have taken off your coat and hung it up along with the bag with your snacks, your gym clothes, the returns parcel you’ve got to drop off at lunchtime. But for many people you encounter on your way in and out and to and from meetings and appointments, the only part of you they see is your coat and your tote bag.So, think about your coat, obviously, but also be aware that even though you can’t see it – you get it out of the cupboard and sling it over your shoulder and leave the house – if your tote bag bears a brand or slogan, then that is the headline emblazoned across your person. If you wouldn’t wear it on a slogan T-shirt, don’t wear it on a tote bag. People will judge you, fact.

Paul Merton talks about the legacy of his hero – and how comedy is too coarse todaySeven years before his suicide, Tony Hancock tried to became a movie star. The Rebel (1961) is a comedy about a clerk who quits his job and moves to Paris to become an artist, despite his total lack of talent. Scripted by Half Hour creators Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, it was a deluxe bespoke vehicle, designed to take Hancock across the Atlantic and turn him into the new Peter Sellers.Brits flocked. Homegrown critics raved. And Hollywood absolutely hated it. (“Stumbling … presumptuous … depressing … low,” reckoned the New York Times, comparing him unfavourably to Norman Wisdom.)It was the start of the end. The following year, after a final series of Hancock’s Half Hour minus Sid James – let go lest Hancock be defined only as part of a double act – Hancock fired Galton and Simpson, too. They then made Steptoe and Son (average audience: 28 million) Hancock made a second bid for international film stardom with a self-scripted feature about a Punch and Judy show in Bognor Regis.“It’s not a comedy,” grimaces Paul Merton. “Don’t expect any laughs. It’s very bitter.” Merton was six when he went to see it with his mother, who began flinching in the first scene, when Hancock swears at the Lord Mayor. By the time he had “taken an ornamental pig and shoved a bunch of flowers up its arse, really quite violently”, her fandom was substantially shaken.Now, those two films that kiboshed Hancock’s big-screen dreams – one wonderful, one sort of awful – have been restored and rereleased with the heave-ho of Merton, a longtime keeper of the Hancock flame. The Rebel, at least, is a revelation: snappy, surreal, full of satirical horsepower and starring a baby-faced, blue-eyed bon vivant. For those of us familiar only with the black-and-white grump, the effervescence is amazing.Tell Merton this, and delight knocks a decade off him. “Ray and Alan always said Hancock seemed to have been born at 40, but in The Rebel he does have the bloom of youth in those cheeks. I think it’s the smooth skin.” Nice clear eyes, too. “Yes, wonderful!” he beams.Yet he is still a far cry from 35-year-old leading men today, few of whom have white tufts and dialogue describing themselves as “stout”. “Well, yes,” says Merton. “But since the early days he was called “Tubs” and there was lots of talk about his terrible feet. Comics then were meant to look a bit funny.”Still, when he remade half a dozen Half Hours in 1996 (big ratings, iffy reviews), he says you would never have guessed he and Hancock were the same age at the time of shooting: “It was to do with the war and with nutrition.” Plus, this was the era of Sgt Pepper, when 64 was repellently elderly. “Now, it’s not considered anything! It’s the new 12!”At 62, Merton looks like a merry, greying, hippie-era John Lennon. He is having cappuccinos in a deserted Bloomsbury hotel, hair straggly, round specs thick and glinting. He wears a charcoal suit and enormously floral shirt presumably bought for TV. In fact, he could have strolled straight off it. Merton surpasses even your most hopeful expectations: funny, friendly, generous, easy.Yet, like his hero, there is a residual sense he is a bit dour and depressive, stemming perhaps from an inpatient episode at Maudsley psychiatric hospital around the time he broke through on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Actually, he says, that was down to some dodgy malaria tablets – his stay extended because staff didn’t believe he actually was on telly every Friday.The smog that surrounds Hancock is harder to shift. “It’s an impossible story to ignore,” says Merton. “The clown with the tear in his eye the comedian who makes everybody else laugh but cannot find satisfaction himself.” An easy cliche is media catnip. Merton “loathed” Stan \u0026amp Ollie, last year’s Laurel and Hardy biopic, because “it tried to create drama where there was no real friction. If I’d seen it in a cinema, I’d have been asked to leave. Every 15 minutes, I was like: ‘Oh, for fuck’s sake!’”Galton and Simpson were, he reports, “just astonished” by the 1991 Hancock film starring Alfred Molina, which shows them smirking “like the Kray twins” in the back row at his ill-fated 1966 stage comeback. Years later, Galton met the writer at a party and punched him to the floor. “Good on him!” grins Merton. “The sheer anger! How dare you do that! Ray and Alan were always grateful and affectionate towards Tony. He’d split his fee with them 5050. He introduced them to France and wine. When they knew him there was little hint of what was to come. He was a bit of a worrier. But then a lot of comedians can be worriers, particularly if you’re not writing your own material.”Hancock’s legacy, he thinks, has suffered under a spotlight fixed on his grubbier troubles – and some unhelpful visuals. “That famous shot of him wearing the big coat and looking miserable over a cup of tea. That was from a programme called The Cold. He’s meant to be ill. Not to look desperately suicidal.”Yet even Merton can’t help having false hindsight. “There’s that line in The Rebel,” he says with a shiver. “‘You’ll be sorry when I’m dead.’ It does rather leap out at you.”Quite why the film was such a disaster across the pond is still a puzzle. After all, Ealing succeeded, despite – or perhaps because of – its amplified Englishness. Even the Carry Ons had cut through. But something about the bluster and camp indignation of Hancock’s delivery seems to have mistranslated. And there is something peculiarly parochial about the narrative of a frustrated fantasist crashing out of the rat race. There are echoes of Billy Liar in the office scenes groundwork for Reggie Perrin in the train commute, in which Hancock’s voiceover speculates about his fellow passengers (few Americans travel to work in the same way).When Merton first saw The Rebel in the late 70s, it was during his three-year stint at Tooting Bec employment office in south London. The sequence on the 8:32 to Waterloo struck a special chord. “Hancock goes: ‘Oh, there’s young Reginald. If this train’s still running in 1980, he’ll be on it.’” Merton shudders. “When I started at 19, they told me about the pension scheme. Going to the same place every day, doing the same job, filled me with horror.”This is another reason The Rebel might not have hit home in the land of the American dream. Even back in 1961, the notion of ditching a mundane job to try to make it big wasn’t so wild. It might also be what limits its contemporary appreciation, when it is taken as read you should seek artistic fulfilment (and jobs for life are the real pipe-dream).In the film, George Sanders’ art dealer is unsparing about Hancock’s lack of talent today, such harsh criticism is a no-no. Whether or not someone actually has any gifts “doesn’t seem to be important any more,” says Merton. There are too many channels and “not that much talent to go around to fill all this space”.He was watching something the other day, he says, that recapped the career highlights of a social media star, “which mostly seemed to be combing his hair. I mean, it’s a long way from Sammy Davis Jr! I know we all want to leave our mark, but now there’s millions of them, I’m not sure it’s any better than it used to be in terms of standing out from the crowd.”The Rebel is especially sharp on the fallacy of inidualism. An existentialists’ party sees them bemoaning the hegemony of office life, while dressed in matching black outfits with identical goatees. Plus ça change, laughs Merton. “I’m by no means an expert on women’s hair, but I have noticed in the last three or four months this fashion, which I think is great, for pink hair and yellow hair. Everyone’s inidual in their own way of doing it, but they’re all doing it.”Merton’s granny-ish lack of savvy is knowingly naive – and real. He delights in a luddite world (no mobile phone, no email, no idea what Instagram is) not so distant from that inhabited by his hero. Despite his day job, he says he doesn’t follow the news or care for politics. “Give me a story about a parrot that’s learned how to drive and I’m in seventh heaven.”Nor does he watch modern comedy (his most recent reference is The Royle Family), mostly because he’s got an “incredibly good memory for jokes” and worries about accidental plagiarism. When he does catch a bit, he’s rarely impressed. “Comedy has coarsened. It’s weak. It’s lazy. I don’t want to sound prudish, and some bodily function jokes can be good. But it’s a shame that if you say ‘fuck’ in front of an audience, they’ll probably laugh. It’s a shock thing. Any weak punchline can be bolstered by sticking that word in there.”Not that we should rose-tint comedy’s golden age. The Blood Donor contains uncomfortable lines about Hancock’s “undiluted British” blood and how it ought not to be mixed. The Two Ronnies had “quite a bit of blackface and antisemitism. Stuff which you’d have gone ‘Ooooh’ at even in 1977.”But Merton doesn’t really want to give anyone a kicking. Comedy is an underrated skill, he says, more so now than ever. It is overlooked for Oscars “because comedy undermines the pomposity of calling yourself something like The Academy of Motion Pictures and Science”. Yet it is harder than drama, because if that audience seems spellbound “they might just be thinking about tomorrow’s shopping. While with comedy, they’re either laughing or they’re not. You know exactly how it’s going.” He sighs. “In the 1920s, Chaplin was compared to Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci, Beethoven and Shakespeare. He was considered a giant of his art.”Hancock’s aspirations were understandable. And in filming The Rebel – about a man desperate for artistic acclaim – he was making his own stab at what he saw as the ultimate immortality. It’s not so unusual, it turns out. As we’re packing up, I ask Merton if he ever fancied getting into film. “Yes, but the film didn’t want me getting into it.” He laughs. “But that was always my real big top ambition.”I hadn’t realised. Oh yes, he says. A couple of years ago, he wrote a script with his wife, Suki Webster. “We couldn’t even get meetings. Channel 4 never even replied.” I’m amazed. Why? He frets it might have felt like a vanity project that he should have got a director onboard first. “But I’ve got no reputation in that world. No credit, no credibility. Still, I think we were rather bemused by the complete lack of interest.”Merton smiles sadly. And, for a second, Hancock is back in the room.The Rebel and The Punch and Judy Man are on Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video from 30 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbd5f4ddb8398d0b09df3b6a82d95057f3b1904/0_0_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3ce5299266449a9bfaec98a8277e72f","title":"manchester united astana europa league match report","story":"Mason Greenwood came to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s rescue just as the Manchester United manager’s faith in his promoted young players was beginning to look misplaced. On his first Old Trafford start, the 17-year-old earned United the points with a coolly struck winner.Solskjær had said he was an expert finisher and here he proved it with an important first United goal, though it was significant that by the 73rd minute he was the only teenager left on the field. “If you just get Mason in the box you know something is going to happen,” Solskjær said. “He might not play in the next game but he’ll be important for us this season. He’ll get his minutes.”Greenwood became United’s youngest ever European scorer, beating Marcus Rashford’s record set in 2016. Yet with three inexperienced youngsters in the side and nine changes from the last starting lineup, United had failed up to that point to take a grip on the game, leading to the conclusion that the present crop of youth products may not be quite as ready as the manager had hoped.Solskjær had stressed the importance of winning the home games in the group and, as the champions of Kazakhstan are probably the weakest side United will face, he will need to rethink his selection policy for future matches if he really wants to progress. It was notable that United were best served by old hands such as Nemanja Matic, Marcos Rojo and Rashford. The last is hardly old at 21, though he was a man among boys in this XI.United signalled their attacking intentions from the outset, with Fred hitting the bar with a thumping 30-yard drive after just three minutes. Remarkably the diminutive Brazilian was not the smallest home player on the pitch, thanks to Solskjær giving a full debut to the even tinier Angel Gomes. United should have taken the lead 12 minutes in when the 19‑year‑old’s corner rebounded invitingly off Axel Tuanzebe for Rashford, yet though the striker was onside and only a yard out, he found Nenad Eric in the Astana goal equal to his attempt to hook the ball over the line.Phil Jones, making his first start of the season, was caught out midway through the first half when Roman Murtazayev turned him neatly and set off towards goal, only to produce the tamest of shots straight at Sergio Romero.All the pre-match attention had been centred on Greenwood’s elevation to the United front line but, though he did produce one shot narrowly off-target, it was Rashford who caused the visiting defence most problems, especially when running through static defenders to reach Rojo’s lofted passes. The old man of the United attack should probably have done better when the left-back’s first invitation found him clear in the area, but his touch let him down when attempting to control the ball. The next time Rashford opted for a first-time volley, only to be denied again by Eric’s reactions on the line.Even such a callow United side were clearly superior to their Kazakh opponents – Astana found it increasingly difficult to cross the halfway line – yet the longer the game remained scoreless the more hesitant and laboured the home side appeared. For all their pressure they could count themselves lucky that Murtazayev is such a poor finisher, for after another Jones mistake had left Marin Tomasov in possession on halfway the Astana forward was given another shooting chance and again put a weak shot far too close to Romero.Rashford had another close-range chance at the end of the first half, again from Rojo, but this time via a deflection, when to the disappointment of the group of home fans in the “away” seats who kept up a barrage of noise throughout the game, he shot straight into the arms of the goalkeeper.Gomes almost created a goal at the start of the second half when he enabled Rojo to send a low cross right along the goalline, one that both Greenwood and Tahith Chong failed to reach for a tap-in at the far post. When Fred forced a save with a free-kick after an hour it seemed to illustrate United’s dearth of attacking options and Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard were sent on shortly afterwards.Both were tangentially involved in the buildup to the breakthrough goal, though it would be unfair to deny Greenwood the credit he deserves for dragging Dorin Rotariu the wrong way and applying a confident finish from an unpromising angle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5de9a103d596fbb83fd63c2192beb4055e2a456/10_0_2550_1530/master/2550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a85a2adca5db61d35d58fc19c97d542","title":"from hart to saivet an xi of the premier leagues forgotten men","story":"Whether out of favour or held back by injury, millions of pounds of talent is sitting unused in England’s top flightSeventy-five England caps are not to be sniffed at but the former Manchester City goalkeeper’s fall has been pretty extraordinary. It is three years since Iceland humiliated England at Euro 2016 and Hart, having failed to repair his reputation at Torino or West Ham, has not started a Premier League game since Boxing Day, a 5-1 home defeat by Everton, which compounded a miserable defensive record: he kept three clean sheets and conceded 41 goals in 19 top-flight matches last season. Not even the departure of Tom Heaton has soothed things for Hart, 32, with Nick Pope restored as Sean Dyche’s No 1 and the arrival of Bailey Peacock-Farrell meaning he is not guaranteed to be second-choice. His sole appearance this season came in a cup defeat by Sunderland, and it proved nightmarish: Sunderland scored from three of their four shots on target and Hart’s only save led to a goal.The Curaçao defender, ordered to train away from the first team by Marco Silva more than a year ago, has not featured for Everton since defeat at Burnley in March 2018. Ronald Koeman, who signed him for Everton and earlier for Southampton, heralded Martina’s versatility but that trait appears to have hindered the 29-year-old, who was relegated to the Under-23s this season. The full-back, a free transfer two years ago, is out of contract next summer. Spent last season on loan at Stoke and then Feyenoord.But for Mark Noble, the New Zealand defender would be the longest-serving player at the club. The scorer of the last goal at Upton Park, Reid is something of a cult hero but West Ham supporters have not seen him in first-team action since March 2018 owing to injury. Reid returned in pre-season after twice undergoing knee surgery but continues to build his fitness behind the scenes. The club are reluctant to rush Reid, who signed a new six-and-a-half year contract to stave off interest in 2015, given his injury history and in the meantime they can call on Angelo Ogbonna, Issa Diop and Fabian Balbuena.Unai Emery told the German defender, as well as Mohamed Elneny, to find a new challenge before the summer window shut but Mustafi stayed. The 27-year-old was at the centre of calamitous defensive displays last season – gifting Crystal Palace three goals springs to mind – and was booed by supporters throughout pre-season. Mustafi has two years on the contract he signed on arrival from Valencia for £35m in 2016, when the World Cup winner was trumpeted as a solution to Arsenal’s meek surrender.Not so long ago José Mourinho said the Argentinian was playing the best football of his career. Now, he’s making up the numbers, with the 29-year-old, signed by Louis van Gaal, sticking around this summer to provide cover for the injured Luke Shaw. Rojo got his first United appearance of the season in a much-changed Europa League side on Thursday. Everton held an interest in Rojo over the summer but injury put paid to the defender’s hopes of following Chris Smalling out of the door, despite Ole Gunnar Solskjær acknowledging he is overstocked at centre-half. Rojo has made 63 league starts since arriving from Sporting Lisbon five years ago but only seven in the past 18 months and was left out of Argentina’s Copa América squad.No player has felt the force of Tanguy Ndombele’s club-record £53.8m move more than the Kenya midfielder. Wanyama has been sidelined after playing a bit-part role last season, during which he made four top-flight starts. No longer a key cog – he missed two Premier League games as Tottenham finished runners-up to Chelsea two years ago –he was given the green light to join Club Brugge in a £10m deal this summer but failed to agree personal terms. When Ndombele was ruled out against Arsenal this month he failed to make the bench with Harry Winks and the 18-year-old Oliver Skipp among those ahead of him in Mauricio Pochettino’s thinking.League Two Colchester are the only first-team opposition the Dutchman has faced this season, with the midfielder, who was playing in the Europa League final for Ajax two years ago, otherwise having to make do with run-outs for the Under-23s. Riedewald’s career was given lift-off by Frank de Boer as a teenager but upon being reunited at Selhurst Park things did not go to plan for either party. De Boer was sacked after 77 days and Riedewald has filled in at centre-back and left-back and not started a Premier League game since February 2018. Ray Lewington, the Palace assistant manager, has acknowledged Riedewald faces something of an impossible job to dislodge captain Luka Milivojevic from the starting lineup, and James McArthur, James McCarthy and Chiekhou Kouyate are also preferred midfield options.To put the midfielder’s Chelsea career into some perspective, his last appearance came at Swindon, six years ago, when the manager was Mourinho, Fernando Torres was up front and Samuel Eto’o on the bench. Oh, and Mark Schwarzer was in goal. The 26-year-old was an £8m signing from Vitesse Arnhem but has spent precious little time at Stamford Bridge. Van Ginkel, who has made four first-team Chelsea appearances, was loaned to Milan in 2014-15, Stoke the following season and then PSV Eindhoven, where he impressed, scoring 14 goals in 28 games in 2017-18 before sustaining a serious knee injury. Van Ginkel is continuing his rehabilitation and building fitness following surgery last year.A £13.5m signing from Lokomotiv Moscow three years ago, the striker is in the final 12 months of his contract and the only surprise is that he has lasted this long. Things turned acrimonious six months after he signed. He was stripped of his shirt number and ordered to train with the Under-23s by Ronald Koeman, and, despite the odd goal and green shoot under Sam Allardyce, it has been a largely disastrous spell. Niasse featured this pre-season before being phased out and last started a league game in May 2018. A fruitless loan at Cardiff did little to resuscitate his career and the arrival of Moise Kean has pushed him further away from Everton’s first team.From Demba Ba and Georginio Wijnaldum to Gabriel Obertan and Emmanuel Rivière, the former chief scout Graham Carr had a mixed record at Newcastle. Saivet, 28, is another arrival with Carr’s fingerprints but the former Bordeaux midfielder has proved a lesser-spotted figure since joining three years ago, having spent the majority of time on loan at Saint-Étienne, Sivasspor and Bursaspor. Saivet’s last Newcastle outing came at West Ham two years ago, when he scored his only goal for the club, but he remains a influential figure for Senegal, playing five of their six matches, including the final, at the Africa Cup of Nations this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac15ac5020c4bd2af6f25485666aad71ca5b7b7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b50d5e84bddac69aa184c00e171ca35","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Still looking for his first home win as Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard will do well to get off the mark against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. While he and his coaching staff will have scrutinised Napoli’s midweek Champions League win over Jürgen Klopp’s side looking for weaknesses, they are unlikely to have learned much they didn’t know already. Diligently maintaining your shape, getting behind Liverpool’s advancing full-backs and hoping at least one of your central defenders can perform a passable imitation of Kalidou Koulibaly is all very well in theory, but a lot easier said than done. And while the prospect of Liverpool’s preposterously-talented front three drawing blanks again seems remote, Lampard can at least take heart from the fact Liverpool only beat one of their fellow top six teams on their travels last season. BGLast November Unai Emery left Mesut Özil out of a trip to Bournemouth because he foresaw “a very demanding match with physicality and intensity.” The Spaniard also expected last Sunday’s assignment at Vicarage Road to be a very demanding match with physicality and intensity – so he picked Özil for the first time this season, explaining that he wanted the player’s technique to be the antidote to Watford’s power. Over a year into the job, Emery is still grasping for hopeful solutions in a squad that remains inadequate. So, even though Özil was omitted for Thursday’s Europa League trip to Eintracht Frankfurt, it is hard to anticipate the make-up of Arsenal’s midfield for Sunday’s home match against Aston Villa. Except to say that Granit Xhaka will probably be in it because Emery clearly believes the captain is more dependable than any of his other options. PDThere can’t be many 37-year-old footballers who have spent their entire career playing for major clubs in a single country without ever once facing a former team. Phil Jagielka may end the weekend without that record having changed – he has played just a single minute of Premier League football so far this season, and was not even on the bench for either of Sheffield United’s last two matches – but sentimentalists will surely be united in hoping he gets a chance to soak up some 360-degree applause as his first and current team, Sheffield United, visit the club he represented for 12 years, Everton. “It will be a really strange feeling for me to go to Goodison,” he says. “To be at a club so long and go back will be quite strange and, I imagine, generate a mixture of emotions. I can’t tell you exactly what I expect.” SBSince winning at Crystal Palace way back in February Manchester United have taken three points from six Premier League away games, despite only one of them being against another top-six side (Arsenal, where they lost in March). Over that period only Tottenham, with two points, have a worse away record. Failure to win at West ham would extend to nine their run of away games without a win in all competitions, something that last happened to them five years ago. But it is a slightly rogue statistic: though there were certainly several poor performances last season they have dominated both of their top-flight trips in this campaign, would have beaten Wolves but for Paul Pogba’s penalty miss and had 21 shots at Southampton, with eight on target (the home side had two). The fixture computer has given them a lopsided season with only one away game against a top-six side before 2020 dawns. With that in mind, a imminent improvement to that record on their travels can be expected. SBManchester City’s 6-0 dismantling of Watford in May’s FA Cup final was the beginning of the end for Javi Gracia. And maybe the second half of last weekend’s match against Arsenal was the start of an upturn under Quique Sánchez Flores. The manager’s priority on his return was to make Watford more solid but against Arsenal they demonstrated how troublesome they can be to opposing defences, especially brittle ones who insist on trying to tip-toe their way out of their own box. Fernandinho looked comfortable alongside Nicolas Otamendi during City’s mid-week win but Watford, encouraged by their own display against Arsenal and the problems that Norwich caused the champions last weekend, could prosper if they aim for City’s most vulnerable spots. PDLeicester were the classier team for large parts of their matches at Chelsea and Manchester United earlier this season but a haul of one point from those games is not the sort of return that will nurture their hopes of breaking into the top six. They need to start beating the big teams. Saturday’s visit by Spurs is an opportunity to do just that, especially as Leicester have had the whole week to prepare while Mauricio Pochettino’s side were being given the run-around by Olympiakos. The comparison between the full-backs will be especially interesting, with Serge Aurier and Danny Rose likely to return to the Spurs team and attempt to keep the excellent Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell on the back foot. Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura should start in support of Harry Kane, as both have looked sharp this season, unlike Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, the latter being especially wan in his last outing. PDSouthampton have already played Liverpool and Manchester United, and after this match they play the remainder of last season’s top nine in seven consecutive league games, a testing run that concludes only when Watford visit on the last day of November, so they could probably do with getting some points here. Ralph Hasenhuttl demonstrated his flexibility in last week’s victory over Sheffield United, with another new shape – the fourth in five league games – but reshuffled with barely half an hour gone and his team on the back foot. The game duly ended with a third successive 1-0 away win in all competitions, ensuring they enter this weekend in full confidence. One thing that would improve their prospects would be if the otherwise impressive Che Adams located his shooting boots: the £15m summer arrival has taken 11 shots so far this season, four more than any other Southampton player, but nine of them have been off target and none have gone in. If Adams’s luck comes good, the Saints might not find their upcoming run of fixtures quite so daunting. SBLast season Wolves were significantly worse in the first half of matches than in the second, ‘winning’ just eight first halves. Had all games finished at the interval they would have come 15th, but happily ‘won’ 15 second halves, scoring nearly twice as many goals (30-17) after the break than they managed before it, and came seventh. Inevitably, their habit of starting poorly repeatedly forced them to battle back from adversity, something that to their credit they frequently achieved – they won 14 points from losing positions, worse only than Liverpool (16) and West Ham (15) and significantly more than this weekend’s opponents, Crystal Palace, who managed only five. Wolves’ damaging habit is one that has significantly worsened over the summer: only in their goalless draw at Leicester in August have they not been losing at the break, but so far no side has bettered them after it. The problem is, this season they are struggling, and sit 19th on three points. SBFollowing their heroics against Manchester City last weekend, Norwich travel to Burnley for a test of a very different kind. Sean Dyche has said he could make changes to his line-up, after Burnley were rather fortunate to take a point at Brighton, courtesy of a very late Jeff Hendrick strike. The Irish international has struggled to get a look in this season, but impressed last weekend along with his fellow substitutes Matej Vydra and Jay Rodriguez and could find himself in the starting line-up against Norwich. Fitness permitting, opposing sttrikers Ashley Barnes and Teemu Pukki are stonewall certainties to start, having scored 50 goals between them in the past calendar year. BGSince their promotion to the Premier League alongside Newcastle in 2017, there are only two teams that Brighton have played every season and not yet lost to: West Ham, with whom they drew their fifth top-flight meeting last month, and Newcastle. It is the continuation of a seagull-savoured trend: across the last 30 seasons the teams have met 12 times, with Brighton winning six, losing just twice (both in their promotion year) and drawing the rest. Last October Brighton won 1-0 at St James’ Park, pushing Newcastle to the bottom of the table in the process, and the home side may consider revenge overdue. “We need to be really pushing to get the three points,” says Jamaal Lascelles. “These games are six-pointers. At home to Brighton, we’ve definitely got to fancy ourselves. Anyone who is going to be in and around us, we’ve got to be taking points off them.” SB"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fbe75714839bdbb70aa9b67bc7cb0ef5c3ff01d/0_35_4970_2982/master/4970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0120dc466a1dbda5ef4b013f9b070b66","title":"premier league team news injury updates and more live","story":"Some Spurs news: Daniel Levy has announced that the club will be refinancing their new-stadium loans but insisted that he will continue to run Tottenham on the relatively frugal business plan that has characterised his chairmanship. The full story on that from our man David Hytner will be up shortly.As for the team, Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking before tomorrow lunchtime’s match at Leicester, and he thinks it’s too early to tell how the season’s going to pan out. “It’s too early to talk about contenders and what will happen in the future. Still all the teams are finding their best,” he said. “We only play five games in the Premier League. Until you play between 10 and 15 games, it’s difficult to see what will happen and the real contenders, teams who are going to be serious contenders. It is still so early.”“Leicester is a very good team with a lot of unbelievable players. After winning the Premier League they rebuild their squad and are doing fantastic with a great manager like Brendan Rodgers, who I know very well. They are doing a fantastic job.” Reflecting on the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos, and the criticism levelled at Christian Eriksen’s performance in particular, Pochettino admitted: “The collective performance wasn’t the best from us. I am happy with the commitment of Christian, he ran a lot and was very committed with the team, the effort but I think I am not concerned about him.” Some reading for you’se: Ben Fisher surveys the top-flight’s subs’ benches and training grounds for this piece on the Premier League’s forgotten men.Ole Gunnar Solskjær has aired some thoughts, in the aftermath of that narrow Man Utd win over Astana. Including that he’s not that stressed by Marcus Rashford’s recent lack of goals because the forward has demonstrated hunger and determination to improve. Talking of forwards, Anthony Martial is expected to miss the trip to West Ham on Sunday along with Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. United could also be without Dan James, who missed the match against Astana with a knock sustained in the victory against Leicester. “I don’t know,” Solskjaer said. “He’s not trained the last few days. Hopefully, but not sure. We’ll have a recovery day with everyone and we’ll see on Saturday.” Solskjær said the likes of Axel Tuanzebe and Fred could also figure in the line-up on Sunday, as is 17-year-old Mason Greenwood after his display against Astana. “It’s always hard to keep players who perform well out of the team,” the manager said. Newcastle news now, and Andy Carroll, no less, could be in for a second Toon debut when Brighton visit on Saturday. Here’s this from PA Media:Andy Carroll could make a second debut for Newcastle against Brighton on Saturday evening after finally shaking off an ankle injury. The 30-year-old last played for former club West Ham in February, and later underwent surgery to address a long-standing problem, but has trained all week with the Magpies, who he joined at the end of the summer transfer window, and is ready to resume his carer. Head coach Steve Bruce said: “As long as he comes through today OK - touch wood, he’ll come through today OK - but yes, he will be involved, which is good news for all of us. “At the top end of the pitch, him and Allan Saint-Maximin as well, we have been a little bit short - and Dwight Gayle is another one - so we have had limited options up top, but certainly the return of Andy and Allan give us something which obviously can only benefit us.”Jürgen Klopp speaks! The Liverpool manager is up before the media, ahead of Sunday’s trip to Frank Lampard’s Chelsea (TM). Injury-wise, he tells us that Naby Keita’s back in training today, but Alisson is not ready yet, though he is “making good progress”. Divock Origi’s not ruled out.As for converns around Virgil van Dijk’s fitness, the manager replies: “We have four world class centre-halves and they can play together, so that can be enough.” As for the man behind them, Adrian, Klopp hails his progress since his Southampton blunder. “The Southampton thing was exceptional but human beings make mistakes. He was only maybe two or three weeks here when we played Southampton and they know each other much better now and hopefully it can stay like this. It couldn’t be the case in the first few games. Asked to assess Frank Lampard’s record so far, he says, “He’s done really well but it’s not my job to talk about other managers. What I can say is they play exciting football, they’ve played last two games in a different system in a busy period, so that’s interesting, they’re an exciting football team, young but good. It’s not a surprise that he’s done well. I said it last year and was not just being polite, it’s the truth. He did an outstanding job at Derby so I’m not surprised he’s doing a really good job at Chelsea.“If there’s one club in the world a transfer ban didn’t hit that bad it’s Chelsea because of their transfer policy of the last few years with a lot high quality players out on loan.”Some news nuggets you may have missed: Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new five-year deal at Chelsea, whose transfer ban seems to have made them realise the breadth of their young talent:And Sheffield United’s new owner Prince Abdullah has defendedexplained the Bin Laden family’s interest in investing in the club:And some random rumours, courtesy of Scott Murray:Morning everyone. It’s been a busy old week and we’re back in the cycle of Premier League teams being in action pretty much every day. No sooner have we digested last night’s European action – featuring relief for Manchester United, satisfaction for Rangers and Celtic, worry for Wolves and an upswing in the Arsenal rollercoaster – than we’re pitched into the weekend’s Premier League action.Starting tonight at St Mary’s, where Southampton host Bournemouth in what should be an agreeable mid-table south coast tussle, Saints seeking their first home win of the season and Bournemouth looking to build on a deserved win over Everton last Sunday.Tomorrow’s programme gives Leicester another chance to test their top-six credentials against a Spurs side who looked a bit ragged in Greece on Wednesday, while Norwich visit Burnley full of the joys of autumn after turning over Manchester City, who host Watford in what the visitors will hope won’t be a repeat of the 6-0 Cup final non-event in May. The second coming of Quique Sánchez Flores does at least appear to have made them more sprightly, if the draw against Arsenal is anything to go by. Elsewhere, Chris Wilder takes his marauding Sheffield United centre-backs to Everton and Newcastle take on a Brighton side who’ve not won since eviscerating Watford on the opening day.It’s not too busy a morning on the press conference front, but Jürgen Klopp is due up soon. We’ll have team news and more about the above games and others as the day progresses.

The first Zelda game for a portable console, it was missing a number of series mainstays – no triforce, no ganon … heck, no Zelda – and took glee in replacing them with bizarre twists, like the plethora of cameos from other Nintendo games or the ability to steal items from a shopkeeper (incurring the penalty of having your saved game renamed THIEF).So it’s delightful to see the game getting a remake after being repeatedly overlooked for re-releases in favour of its more conventional cousins such as Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time. And it is the sort of remake that sets the standard for what we should expect: every single thing fans love about the original game is here, except rather than a four-colour GameBoy screen, it’s beautifully rendered in 3D with another 25 years of Easter eggs added for those dedicated enough to find them.Link’s Awakening sees Link washed up on shore of the mysterious Koholint Island and tasked with gathering eight magical musical instruments to awaken the Wind Fish and return home. It’s the 2D Zelda formula at its purest: enter dungeon, find item that unlocks path to next dungeon, rinse, repeat. There’s no Link to the Past-style twist here: simply fitting the game as it is on an old GameBoy cartridge was feat enough.That means the game, in particular the overworld, is a masterpiece of efficient design, packing as many secrets as possible into any given screen. Which is good, because you’ll be back-tracking a lot, even once you unlock the fast-travel system a few hours in it’s nice to notice, as you trek a path for the fifth time, that now you can pick up that boulder and see what’s underneath it.There are a few more fast-travel points than in the first game – and more secret seashells to collect, and more heart pieces, and a whole figurine-collecting subgame that is completely ignorable – but by and large, this really is the same game. If, like me, you played Links Awakening until the cartridge broke, you’ll probably be able to navigate on hazy memories alone.But the problem with being such a faithful recreation of a 26-year-old game is, well, it’s still a 26-year-old game. And occasionally it shows. For instance, sometimes the doors will lock in a dungeon and you need to defeat all the enemies to get them to unlock. That’s fine, until you hit some bosses who need bombs to defeat. Bombs you may not have, and which you can’t get in the now-locked room. Time for either a deliberate death or a hard reset!Some enemies can only be hurt with your spin attack. There is no way of telling which ones these are, short of remembering to try your spin attack in the middle of hectic boss fights – at the same time as trying the magic dust, and the bombs, and boomerang and arrows and fire rod and everything else – because this era of Zelda really likes you using the right weapon on the right thing.Some frustrations have been softened. The extra buttons on the Switch mean that now your sword, shield, power bracelet and Pegasus boots are always equipped once you have them, limiting the endless item-swapping of the GameBoy version (although reducing some previously complex fights to triviality).Other new introductions have fared less well. Worst is Dampé, a new character who lets you piece together new dungeons from rooms you’ve previously encountered. Supposedly a mini Zelda Maker, a prototypical twin to Super Mario Maker, it ends up as a horrible grindy mess. You know the solutions to all the puzzles and can’t do anything more interesting, so end up simply finding the minimal new creation required to fulfil each of Dampé’s challenges, then ambling through the same 10 rooms you use each time, to get a few extra quarter hearts and secret seashells.Link’s Awakening is a fantastic remake of a game that was fantastic in 1993. Fans must decide for themselves if those two things combine to make it a fantastic game in 2019 – particularly when the glorious Cadence of Hyrule is also on the Switch to scratch the itch you may have for 2D Zelda – and at a third of the price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b97b8cf0a8bd1a0ff2a819eb024c7f669937136/335_0_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f8c2a3b2345952dafe84c2c7cfadf9","title":"american airlines aairpass golden ticket","story":"My dad was one of the only people with a good-for-life, go-anywhere American Airlines pass. This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare Airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes — a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncles’ arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel. … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away. … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

Of course I would be able to help her with her shopping! Let’s get this shopping-helping show on the road, I wanted to shout. For I am an excellent person and enthusiastic assistant to those in need. Unfortunately, it turned out she didn’t mean shopping as a metonym for shopping bags, but shopping as in the verb. She had not yet been to the shop. This was not me lifting two Lidl bags and carrying them to the bus stop, as I had envisioned this was me going to Lidl.Forty-five minutes later, this wily elder of mine – who had also swindled me out of £3 by this point and made a fair few comments I would describe as racist –let me know that she lived on the top floor of a block of flats but, not to worry, because the block was only a mile or so away. Despite all this – “this” being the entire afternoon – I still feel contented that I helped this lady out, even if I have avoided her since.Good deeds are considered selfless, but they are often not. This is because a fair number of good deeds take minimal effort the effort is outweighed by the feeling of self-satisfaction. If anything, it is pure human profit, and as such perhaps not altruistic at all. (There are, of course, the times when we go above and beyond, when we inconvenience ourselves for others. I can summon up many occasions when friends, all over the world and in all seasons, have gone above and beyond for me.)But mostly it’s something that, for you, takes very little, but can make all the difference to another. The teenage girl frantic in a strange city who asks for directions, or to borrow your phone. Lifting someone’s suitcases down station stairs or grabbing one end of a frazzled mother’s pram, its inhabitant blotchy-faced and screaming.

Early on, she told me about a man she had met briefly, years earlier, to whom she felt a sexual attraction unlike anything she had experienced before. Nothing happened, so it stayed an unexplored fantasy.A year ago they met again by chance, and the chemistry was (she explained) instantly electric. We had a frank discussion about her desire for him, which resulted in her taking him to bed one afternoon for what she described as the best orgasm she had ever experienced. This was followed by weekly lunchtime sex (at my apartment in London).Soon afterwards, my partner and I decided to live together, and her lover began to visit our place once or twice a week. The challenge, for me, was to recognise that the chemistry she had with him was no threat to her love for me. I could not ask her to forgo such enjoyment (he is 20 years younger than me, 15 years younger than her, so there is a huge difference in the pleasure she gets from each of us). I recognised that the problem was mine, not hers.We interact comfortably and they feel unselfconscious about showing their mutual attraction in my presence. I enjoy seeing their foreplay or hearing them having noisy sex in the spare room – not as a matter of eroticism, simply two people having a good time.She would not want me to have the same, and so I remain happily monogamous.

Technology encourages us to believe we can all have first-hand access to the ‘real’ facts – and now we can’t stop fighting about it. By  William DaviesWe live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural ides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC’s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion.Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The “mainstream media” is the principal focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking.But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate.This mentality now s the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with “mainstream” institutions has become a mass sentiment.This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable.This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either inidually or collectively.Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are publicly accused of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed “post-truth”). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: iniduals are increasingly suspicious of the “official” stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves.On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions.But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the conspiracy theorist, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world?It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an unimaginable excess of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable.And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions.The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups – millennials or the white working-class, say – are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality.This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become too concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases.The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the anti-vaxx movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society.Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun’s lies about Hillsborough to the BBC’s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s.What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, anti-heroes or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on inidual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment.There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of Ben Stokes and Gareth Thomas, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media’s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain’s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened.The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the “mainstream media”, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased – as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal.Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets.Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is “big data”, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies.The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial.But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today’s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties.The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged “important” to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon’s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately.This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply “speak for itself”. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention – the ultimate in scientific objectivity.Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that “we might describe the contemporary media moment – and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation – as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness”. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data – CCTV, records of digital activity and so on – now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison.One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. “Pics or it didn’t happen” is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that “the camera doesn’t lie” has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is “so show me”.This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them.On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable.On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming – greater than human intelligence can comprehend – our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the “frames” that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning.What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn’t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning.Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person’s offcut is another person’s revealing nugget. Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one’s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as “nutpicking”). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or “fake news”, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation.Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason.The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with inidual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments.Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn mouthing during Prime Minister’s Questions? Who took the photo of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies.While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of “bias” means “that’s not my perspective”. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, “the fundamental question of the web” is: “Why wasn’t I consulted?”What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy.This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the “will of the people” is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the iniduals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently begun to use Facebook Live to speak directly to “the people” from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented.What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to “truth”, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years.What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead?If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes.The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of Rupert Murdoch, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the ision between the two.Then there are those iniduals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and James Purnell. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the Evening Standard, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily , which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the  website proudly includes a “Best of Boris” section.)Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all “mainstream” democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people. One of the reasons they are able to do this is because there is a grain of truth in what they say.The financial obstacles confronting critical, independent, investigative media are significant. If the Johnson administration takes a more sharply populist turn, the political obstacles could increase, too – Channel 4 is frequently held up as an enemy of Brexit, for example. But let us be clear that an independent, professional media is what we need to defend at the present moment, and abandon the misleading and destructive idea that – thanks to a combination of ubiquitous data capture and personal passions – the truth can be grasped directly, without anyone needing to report it.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f386bd54ba4808cb44b4f7de01d317169b2886d4/363_440_8275_4966/master/8275.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=33a599fd1212255e3a2afe5ad1facf42","title":"netflix spend 500m british made tv shows films","story":"Streaming service reveals 2019 budget for more than 50 projects as it battles new rivalsNetflix has revealed it will be spending $500m (£400m) making more than 50 TV shows and films in the UK this year, as the streaming company prepares to dig deeper into its pockets to fight new rivals including Disney and Apple.It is the first time Netflix has detailed its spend on making and licensing British-made shows – which include The Crown, Black Mirror and Sex Education.Speaking at the Royal Television Society conference on Friday, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, said the UK had the second-biggest production budget after the US.Netflix, which expects to spend about $15bn globally making and licensing TV shows and films this year, will increase its budget and productions still further to fight the challenge of the launch of a swathe of well-funded new rivals.In October, it will take over all of Shepperton Studios, home to films ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins, as part of a 10-year deal to guarantee the space it needs to pump out its ever-increasing number of productions without delay.Disney, which is due to launch its global streaming service, Disney+, recently struck a similar deal with Shepperton’s parent Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises.Competition is heating up in the streaming wars as new entrants attempt to break the global duopoly of Netflix and Amazon.

Yet as the East Sussex foursome return with their first album in seven years, it’s clear that they are no longer the paragons of nicey-niceness they once seemed. Cause and Effect sees the band complete the transition from innocence to experience, producing a collection of mid-life crisis tales that leave rather a bitter taste.Sonically, at least, the record sees the group preserve all the anodyne markers of their original iteration – still present is the watered-down, politely jaunty indie with choruses that swell irresistibly with non-specific emotion, while eternally cherubic frontman Tom Chaplin continues to veer between his rousing mid-range bellow and cut-glass falsetto. Lyrically, however, it’s a different story: Cause and Effect is a warts-and-all document of the demise of a long-term relationship. There are gut-punching accounts of the loneliness, regret and sharp shock of leaving the family home, yet sometimes the brutal honesty serves to alienate – such as on Stupid Things, which details our hero’s reckless behaviour, marital deception and his negligence of fatherly duties. The album ends with a skip in its step thanks to a new romance, though it’s hard to feel a huge amount of goodwill.

They said their negotiating “red line” was that the party itself had to commit to campaigning to stay in the EU, and prepared for a battle with those who want Labour not to commit to either side.Corbyn has repeatedly declined to say which side he would campaign on, if any, at a potential second referendum, after pledging that as prime minister he would negotiate a better Brexit deal and put that to a public vote alongside the option of remain.Pro-remain activists have been seeking signs of a compromise from the leader’s office that could avoid a row at the upcoming autumn conference.However, groups involved in the push to make Labour an unequivocally pro-remain party said they were prepared to force the issue to a vote if no concessions emerged on or before Saturday night, when the text of a motion to be put to delegates would emerge.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “The iding line at this conference isn’t about whether Jeremy Corbyn is forced to campaign for remain – it’s about what happens with the party machine – the data, money and infrastructure that could prove vital in a referendum. We need to send a signal to members, and to our voters, that Labour as a party backs remain.”More than 80 similar pro-remain motions from local parties have been submitted to the conference, which will be subject to a “compositing” process to determine the text of a single motion to be put to delegates.If no text can be agreed, it is possible that two motions could result – one proposing Labour becomes a clearly pro-remain party and another closer to the leadership’s position of letting the public decide in a second referendum.The vote would then be likely to take place on Monday. However, the conference is not certain to vote in favour of a clear pro-remain position, despite an overwhelming majority of members in favour of staying in the EU, as most trade unions have taken the same position as the leadership.If it gets to a vote on the conference floor, many delegates could also be reluctant to undermine Corbyn’s stated position that he wants a second referendum with the public deciding between a Labour-negotiated leave and remain option.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.To avoid a damaging public split being aired at conference, one option is for the national executive committee (NEC) to step in on Sunday or Monday morning and table an overriding motion that is closer to Corbyn’s position.However, several shadow cabinet ministers would like the party itself to commit to campaigning to remain in the EU. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, have all stated they would campaign against Brexit in a second referendum.The majority of pro-remain motions have been drafted by leftwing groups Another Europe is Possible, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour, containing a commitment to “campaign energetically for a public vote and to remain”, alongside support for free movement, a radical domestic agenda and a vision to transform Europe.Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central, said the party had to be alive to the threat of the Lib Dems, who have wooed some remain voters by taking a stance in favour of cancelling Brexit altogether.“In constituencies all over the country, leave seats as well as remain ones, we are in danger of losing because our voters are turning to the Lib Dems,” she said.“We need to reach out across the Brexit ide with our radical domestic programme, but we also need to send a clear signal to our remain voters that we understand them and are on their side.”Eloise Harris, a delegate from Bethnal Green and Bow Labour party, added: “Jeremy Corbyn appears committed to standing above the fray and playing honest broker in a future referendum on Brexit. That can work. But as we go into a general election, members need to know that the party itself is on our side.“Labour is a remain party – our members, unions and MPs are overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU. The public knows this already. We should move forward with energy and clarity and back remain, while giving full license to anyone who wants to campaign the other way. That is the only way to unite us and move the conversation on to our radical domestic offer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c32f47141464feb553951a29a198981191b2466/0_115_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2efe6793e88f7120d91cf301220bafa4","title":"conservative members suspended for online islamophobia","story":"Move comes as former Tory MEP accuses serving minister of anti-Muslim commentsA number of Conservative party members have been suspended for posting or endorsing Islamophobic content online.The BBC was passed details of a number of incidents by an anonymous Twitter user, and it highlighted more than 20 new cases to the Conservative party after independently verifying each one.Incidents were said to have ranged from iniduals “liking” Islamophobic pictures or statements on one or two occasions, to people who said they were Tory members regularly posting anti-Muslim content.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation.“The Conservative party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. That’s why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur.”Party sources said not all the names provided were Tory members and the timings and details of any such investigation would be guided by the government’s review into a definition of Islamophobia.The government announced in May it had begun the process for establishing a working definition of Islamophobia, after confirming it would not be adopting the wording proposed by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims. The timeline for this work was unclear.Announcements of the suspensions came as the former Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim said that senior Conservative party members, including a serving minister, had made Islamophobic remarks about him.“I have experienced conversations taking place with Islamophobic content directly about me, being conducted by very senior members of the Conservative party – in fact parliamentarians, one of whom is in fact a serving minister at this moment in time,” he told the BBC.“Ultimately, this is about values and if we allow Islamophobia, or any other form of discrimination, to go unchecked, what we are doing actually is undermining our own values.”Karim did not reveal the name of the minister in question but said he would provide it to the Conservative party if it wanted to investigate the alleged incident.In May, the Muslim Council of Britain urged the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate allegations of Islamophobia within the Conservative party after it was reported it was dealing with more than 100 alleged cases, including a host of previously unreported ones.“We are not surprised by the latest revelations,” said Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB. “They are a manifestation of institutional Islamophobia within the Conservative party, and corroborate the polling done demonstrating the scale of the issue.“An independent and specific inquiry into Islamophobia specifically is long overdue. Sadly the Conservative response has been woeful. From denial, through to now a reluctant commitment to a broad and watered-down investigation that we fear will do nothing to address this problem.”Khan said Islamophobia was “endemic” in the Conservative party. He said Karim’s claim was “extremely serious and indicative of the scale of the problem” and the minister must be investigated immediately.During a Tory leadership election debate in June, Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, committed to holding an independent investigation into allegations of Islamophobia and asked the other candidates whether they would also commit to it. They all appeared to agree, including Boris Johnson, who said: “Hear, hear.”However, Johnson later said he understood they had committed to a general investigation “into all types of prejudice and discrimination including antisemitism”, not Islamophobia specifically."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaea458a0c1c893aeed69adc1cc2e43d1d169fd/0_105_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b690ec7daa0edca1a9c5dbecec3caf43","title":"climate scientists prepare largest ever arctic expedition","story":"Hundreds of researchers will spend year on ship improving understanding of sea iceResearchers from more than a dozen countries are preparing to launch the biggest and most complex expedition ever attempted in the central Arctic – a year-long journey through the ice they hope will improve the scientific models that underpin our understanding of climate change.In the €140m (£123m) Mosaic expedition, 600 scientists from 19 countries including Germany, the US, Britain, France, Russia and China will work together in one of the most inhospitable regions of the planet.“The Arctic is the epicentre of global climate change,” said Markus Rex of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, who will lead the expedition. “At the same time the Arctic is the region of the planet where we understand the climate system least.”Packed full of scientific equipment, the German icebreaker RV Polarstern will leave the port of Tromsø in northern Norway accompanied by a Russian vessel to search for a suitably large ice floe on which to anchor and set up base.As the days get shorter and the sea freezes around it, the Polarstern will slowly drift off on its own towards the North Pole while rotating teams of 100 scientists spend two months each conducting research on the ice.Stefanie Arndt, a sea ice physicist who will join the mission in mid-February, said the unique advantage of this expedition compared with others was that researchers would be able to observe processes in the Arctic across an entire cycle of seasons.“What’s particularly interesting is the transition from winter to spring,” she said, a time when the ice is normally too thick for ships to reach the central Arctic.Recording changes in the density, size and type of snow will help scientists better understand the flows of energy in the Arctic. “For example, how much light the snow reflects back into the atmosphere, how much it absorbs and how much light reaches the upper ocean,” said Arndt. “This has big implications for the ecosystem.”Energy from light affects algae growth and ocean temperatures, which in turn influence how much sea ice melts from below.Understanding these and other complex processes occurring in the Arctic is essential for the increasingly sophisticated computer models scientists use to predict weather and climate. Experts believe that any disruption to the Arctic’s delicate cycle of freeze-and-thaw will be felt farther south, though it is still not clear how.Recent changes in the jet stream – a current of air that circles and insulates the Arctic like a giant thermos – have allowed warm, moist winds from low latitudes to move north. At the same time, chilly blasts of Arctic air – the dreaded polar vortices – have brought deep freeze conditions to the continental US and Europe.Concerns about global heating have spread far beyond the scientific community in recent years. The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and before a UN climate summit in New York next week.Rex, the expedition head, said the cooperation between scientists from many different countries stood in contrast to the geostrategic jostling that big powers have started engaging in as the Arctic, with its untapped riches, begins to open up to exploration.He put the fact that Germany, hitherto a second-league player in the Arctic, was leading the expedition down to the country’s technical and logistical expertise.“We’re doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it,” said Rex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa1bed53e006fcf11119867224a1dac0c467643/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d6c5eab5a22bc042ae6f12ec51da7b","title":"parliament apologises for photographing rough sleepers","story":"Contractor took photos of homeless people as they slept near palace of WestminsterParliament has apologised to a group of rough sleepers who bed down close to the palace of Westminster after taking inidual photos of them without their permission while they slept.About 20 people sleep rough in and around the tunnels connecting parliament to Westminster tube station. They woke last Friday to find a cleaning contractor employed by the parliamentary estate taking photographs of them.One man, a 45-year-old from Latvia who works on a building site, said he was astonished to be woken up by someone taking photographs.“A manager deliberately came and took photos of us while we were sleeping. There were about six of us sleeping upstairs and 12 of us downstairs,” he said. “We were so shocked about this. Downstairs in the tunnel leading to parliament is the best place in London for rough sleepers to sleep. It’s warm and it’s safe because there are lots of cameras around here. I don’t understand why pictures of us were being made. This was a proper mistake. We know they want to move us out and maybe that’s why they were taking our photos.”A House of Commons spokesperson said: “We apologise for any distress caused this should not have happened and has been immediately stopped.”The homeless people previously all slept in one tunnel but the parliamentary estate effectively evicted them last month by installing shutters to mark parliament’s new boundary following a transfer of land from Transport for London. The new shutters prevented the group from sleeping there, so they are now spread out in various areas nearby.The House of Commons spokesperson did not explain why its contractors had taken photos of inidual rough sleepers.“It’s a human rights breach to take photos of us while we’re sleeping,” said another member of the group of rough sleepers. “By moving us from the part of the tunnel we were sleeping in before, they’ve actually made the problem worse. Previously we were in one place now people are sleeping in different places close to parliament. They want to get rid of us but I don’t know where they expect us to go. Parliament is empty at the moment because it has been suspended. Maybe we can all move in there for a few weeks!”It is understood that the parliamentary estate has instructed its contractor to stop the practice of taking photos of inidual rough sleepers immediately and that all images of rough sleepers have been deleted after the  raised the issue.There is concern among the rough sleepers about possible police and immigration enforcement activity. Previously the homeless charity St Mungo’s has worked with Home Office immigration enforcement teams to identify non-British rough sleepers, who in some cases were subsequently deported.A spokesperson for the Public Interest Law Centre, which brought a successful legal challenge against the Home Office policy to round up migrant rough sleepers, said: “There is a long history of criminalisation and enforcement against homeless people in and around Westminster. This incident further shows how authorities treat homeless people with contempt, dehumanising their very existence in the process. This government has promoted austere and hostile policies which have caused an exponential rise in homelessness and an increase in enforcement measures.”A spokesperson for the Labour Homelessness Campaign said: “Working closely with the Westminster rough sleepers, I know this is just the latest step in a trend of parliament refusing to treat rough sleepers with the most basic respect as human beings. If even parliament, with the eyes of the country on it, won’t guarantee any fundamental rights of homeless members of our community, that’s a sign of how unequal our society is in every respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87ba59c282339dd1deb6b7a89144dba4dd4fd47e/255_23_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c364439f671c1441404024981b1b0880","title":"lewis hamilton hard racing singapore grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton reiterated his intent to give no quarter when he returns to the track for the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend. The Briton was disappointed after Charles Leclerc was not penalised for squeezing him wide at the last round in Monza. Hamilton said afterwards that he would adjust his driving accordingly, a view he repeated at the Marina Bay circuit on Thursday.Leclerc was issued with a warning rather than penalty at the Italian Grand Prix, a decision in keeping with the recent stewards’ policy of allowing the drivers to race. Hamilton said he would adapt if that was how the rules were to be interpreted. “I look forward,” he said. “There’s nothing I can do about the past. I’m down for hard racing.”His views were echoed by several drivers including Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. The latter pushed Leclerc wide in Austria and did not receive a penalty, from which Leclerc drew conclusions on how far he believed he could go on track.“I don’t mind a few touches here and there throughout a grand prix,” said Verstappen. “Even if it’s not touches then you should be able to defend yourself. For me it’s fine and every driver knows this so we will all race the same.”Hamilton, who leads the world championship by 63 points from his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, has four wins in Singapore, including the past two meetings, while Leclerc comes into the race on the back of two consecutive victories. Ferrari are expected to be on the back foot, however, their car at its weakest on tracks such as Marina Bay that demand high downforce.Robert Kubica announced he will be leaving Williams at the end of this season. The Pole made a remarkable comeback to return to F1 this season after suffering severe injuries in a crash while rallying in 2011. He has struggled, however, in the uncompetitive Williams, and been outpaced by his teammate, George Russell.With most seats for next season already confirmed, it is unlikely he will continue in F1. A move to DTM has been rumoured and Kubica said: “I am looking for different opportunities. In order to evaluate our opportunities, I have taken the decision that I will not continue more with Williams after this year, so I will stop at end of the year with the team and this opens up opportunities for me in the future in different scenarios.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes. And Uruguay just want to win a gameWe hope to win it, but is that realistic? We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace. And, crucially for a World Cup, we don’t have a consistent goal kicker. Still ... we can come together once in a while. Aiden Smith•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe “glory days” of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approach the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

And as the civil rights attorney who helped establish the Rooney Rule – which requires NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs – he understood the deeper significance of the moment for a league that long has excluded African Americans from its most important and celebrated on-field position.“Then you look at Lamar Jackson. His field awareness was so impressive. He can sense the pass rush and escape. He places the ball with nice touch. He’s showing the complete game.“We’re trying to overcome 100 years – literally 100 years! – of stereotyping of black quarterbacks. And they demolished all of them in that one game.”As the NFL celebrates its centennial season, the league is experiencing a changing of its quarterback guard. Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck are retired. Eli Manning has been benched. Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season, and faces an uncertain future.Health permitting, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers continue to truck along – but each is far closer to the end of their careers than the beginning.All of those players are white. Meanwhile, the NFL’s most promising and accomplished young signal-callers are predominantly black: not just Jackson and Murray, but also Dallas’ Dak Prescott (26 years old), Houston’s Deshaun Watson (24), and Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes (24).And that’s not all. As Jason Reid of The Undefeated has noted, 2019 marks the first year in which the league’s reigning MVP (Mahomes), No 1 overall pick (Murray), highest-paid player (Seattle’s Russell Wilson), and a former MVP (Carolina’s Cam Newton) are all African American quarterbacks.The answer lies in a lengthy history of overt discrimination and subtle bias – and a determined, multi-generational effort by black athletes to overcome both.“How do you get from there to here?” Mehri says. “You build a wall of integration. Bit by bit. Brick by brick.”The NFL’s story began with a standout African American quarterback: Fritz Pollard, a chemistry major and All-American at Brown University, led the Akron Pros to the league’s inaugural championship in 1920.In 1933, however, the NFL secretly decided to ban black players – reportedly at the behest of former Washington owner George Preston Marshall, a committed segregationist who in a 1942 interview argued that if African Americans were allowed to play, “white players, especially those from the South, would go to extremes to physically disable them”.The ban mirrored the status of black Americans at the time: separate, unequal and living in a de facto apartheid state via Jim Crow in the South and a patchwork of exclusionary laws and customs everywhere else.The ban also was rooted in the widespread, racist beliefs about black inferiority that underpinned segregation. In the early part of the 20th century, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and sports sociologist, whites assumed that African-Americans lacked the physical stamina and emotional courage to excel at contact sports like boxing and football.After Jack Johnson became the first African American heavyweight champion in 1908 – and then defeated “great white hope” James J Jeffries in a 1910 bout that triggered white race riots across the country – that assumption morphed.“Whites accepted that blacks were physically evolved, but decided that they were intellectually un-evolved – that they were actually lower on the ladder of evolution than white people, and somehow closer to our animal ancestors. And that’s the ideology, the cultural context, that prevailed when the major sports in the US were desegregated.”Though the NFL lifted the ban in 1946, opportunities for African American quarterbacks were almost nonexistent. George Taliaferro became the league’s second ever black quarterback in 1950, and even made three Pro Bowls – but only as a rusher and receiver who never completed more than 16 passes in a season.The league’s third black quarterback, Willie Thrower, was given even less of a chance to make a mark. In 1953, the Chicago Bears inserted him for a single drive against the San Francisco 49ers – and after Thrower completed three of eight passes to put his team in the red zone, replaced him with white starter George Blanda.In sportswriter William C Rhoden’s book Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback, Thrower’s son, Melvin, recalled that his parents owned a bar called “The Touchdown Lounge”, with a picture of his father on the wall.“On the bottom, it said: THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, 1953,” Melvin said. “People told him to take it down. ‘You’re lying,’ they said. ‘You’re lying. That ain’t you. Take it down.’”As football and American society continued to desegregate in the 1960s and 70s, the sport was rife with what sociologists call “racial stacking” – a sorting process in which iniduals are funneled into certain positions based on stereotypes.From Pop Warner to the NFL, the down-the-middle positions of center, inside linebacker and quarterback were considered to be “thinking” spots. As such, they were seen as too cerebral for African American athletes, who additionally were thought to lack the leadership and grit to lead other players and perform under duress.Of course, this was balderdash. Sandy Stephens quarterbacked the University of Minnesota to a national championship in 1960, and many other black signal-callers at the game’s lower levels proved perfectly capable when called upon meanwhile, plenty of white quarterbacks tossed interceptions, made boneheaded mistakes and otherwise labored in utter mediocrity.Nevertheless, stacking had a pernicious, two-pronged effect: drastically reducing the pool of African American college quarterbacks who conceivably could be signed by a NFL team, and making it almost impossible for one of them to get a fair shake in the league.Ken Shropshire, who competed with and against African American quarterbacks in a predominantly black high school league in Los Angeles, experienced stacking for the first time while playing for Stanford University in the 1970s. Black teammates James Lofton and Tony Hill both had been prep signal-callers. Both were converted to wide receivers in college.“I learned that was a regular thing,” said Shropshire, the CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of the book In Black and White: Race and Sports in America. “Ironically, we had a contest in practice for who on the team could throw the ball the longest. James Lofton would win every year.”When Denver drafted Marlin Briscoe in 1968, the Broncos told Omaha University’s star quarterback that they wanted him to play defensive back. Briscoe had other ideas. Nicknamed “the Magician,” he insisted that he wouldn’t sign unless the Broncos allowed him to participate in a three-day quarterback tryout at the start of training camp.“They thought I was crazy,” said Briscoe, who grew up idolizing Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. “It was unheard of to see a black man play QB in the pros. But all I wanted to do was showcase my skills.”The tryout, Briscoe said, went as he expected. Seven other quarterbacks, all of them white, got to make 10 throws during drills. Briscoe always went last, and got “maybe seven or eight”.At the end of camp, Denver named Briscoe a starter – at cornerback. But after starting quarterback Steve Tensi was injured and backup Joe DiVito struggled during the Broncos’ home opener, coach Lou Saban put Briscoe in under center.Briscoe completed his first pass for 22 yards. He later drove Denver 80 yards, scored on a 12-yard run, and nearly led the Broncos to a comeback win. A week later, he became the first black starting quarterback in pro football’s modern era – and ultimately finished the season as the runner-up for AFL rookie of the year, compiling five starts, 1,589 passing yards, 308 rushing yards and 14 touchdown passes.The following summer, Briscoe went back to Omaha to take college courses. His phone rang. “Denver was having quarterback meetings,” he said. “Here I am, the starting QB at the end of the season, and I didn’t even get an invitation to the competition.”Briscoe flew to Denver. He discovered his services under center were no longer needed. “I never did get an explanation,” he said. “But I understood what was going on.” He ended up in Buffalo, where he played receiver and was named All-Pro before winning two Super Bowls catching passes for the Miami Dolphins.Briscoe never played quarterback in the NFL again. But he had broken an important barrier. “When I got to Denver, it was always thought that you’d have a fan backlash, a player backlash, that whites wouldn’t root or play for a black quarterback,” he said. “Well, that was a myth.“My offensive line, they were all from the south. Not only had they never played for a black QB, but prior to the pros, they had never played with black players. And the first thing out of their mouths was, ‘don’t let ‘em touch the Magician.’“For them to embrace me, for the fans to embrace me, that was validating. And I knew that I had to succeed. If I didn’t prove that I could do it, then how long would it take for another black quarterback to get a chance?”Other trailblazers followed. James “Shack” Harris – Briscoe’s roommate and mentee in Buffalo – became the first African American quarterback to start a NFL season opener, start and win a playoff game, play in the Pro Bowl and be selected Pro Bowl MVP.In 1978, Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to be selected in the NFL draft’s first round. Nine years later, he made history again by starting and winning the Super Bowl with Washington.Meanwhile, Warren Moon – who went undrafted after wining a Rose Bowl with the University of Washington – won five straight championships in Canada before signing with the Houston Oilers and embarking on a prolific 17-year NFL career that made him the first black quarterback inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Like Briscoe, the African American signal-callers who came after in the 1970s and 80s couldn’t be merely average. They had be exceptional. They were given less time to develop than their white peers, and less leeway to make mistakes. They also had to fight against a racialized conception of how a pro quarterback was supposed to play.Tall, statuesque pocket passers were the gold standard. Shorter, more mobile ones were seen as fragile and unreliable. Coming out of college football, white quarterbacks tended to fit in the former category, black quarterbacks the latter.According to former NFL player and sports historian Mike Oriard, it’s no coincidence that the 6ft 4in, 235lb Williams wasn’t considered much of a running threat – or that Williams’ college coach, Grambling State legend Eddie Robinson, told Harris not to run the 40-yard dash for league scouts, the better to avoid a positional switch.“The rise of black quarterbacks created the idea of the white quarterback,” said Oriard, an emeritus professor and dean at Oregon State University. “Before the stereotype emerged that black QBs were athletic, there were no distinctive characteristics associated with white quarterbacks.”By winning NFL games with their arms and their legs, Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick helped change attitudes toward black quarterbacks with fleet feet. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, white signal-callers who could run and scramble, like Fran Tarkenton and Steve Young, were seldom disparaged as merely “athletic.”)Concurrently, the evolution of the pro game turned a perceived liability into a strength. As passing became paramount and pass rushers faster and more punishing, quarterbacks who could escape the pocket, make throws on the move and turn surefire sacks into gains became increasingly valuable.At the college level, black quarterbacks have become much more commonplace: since 2010, at least one African American signal-caller has started in the national championship game. Mehri believes that has produced a trickle-up effect in the NFL, as social science research indicates that companies are nearly 200 times more likely to hire a minority candidate if the finalist pool for a job includes more than one minority.Of the league’s 90 quarterbacks currently active or on injured reserve, 19 (21 percent) are black – which means African Americans remain underrepresented at the position. Nevertheless, Shropshire believes that the gap is closing, and that the league is as close to being an on-field meritocracy as it has ever been.“For those of us who follow this closely, the moment you sort of know is when you can no longer name all of the black quarterbacks in the league,” he said. “That happened for me a couple of years ago.”Some bias still lingers. A 2004 study of football scouting publications found that white athletes were more likely to be praised for mental abilities, while blacks received physical compliments. A pair of 2017 studies found that white and black college students were more likely to describe pro quarterbacks in stereotypical ways than not, and that whites in general assigned stereotypes to black signal-callers but not to white ones.Two years ago, a  analysis of the previous seven league drafts showed that the average pick for a black quarterback was 70th overall as opposed to 53rd for a white quarterback – even though those same black quarterbacks had a career passer rating slightly above 90.0, higher than the average rating for their white counterparts.“It takes a couple of generations to change the legacy of racial ideology,” Coakley said. “It’s dying a slow death. And we may be at a point where it is grasping to its last breaths.”Tell that to Baltimore’s Jackson. Prior to the draft, veteran NFL executive Bill Polian suggested that the youngest-ever Heisman trophy winner would be better off playing receiver in the pros, while others raised concerns about Jackson’s ability to read defenses.In response, Jackson declined to run the 40-yard dash for scouts. He opened this season by throwing five touchdown passes in a 59-10 victory over Miami, then told reporters, “not bad for a running back.” After out-dueling Murray, he had Ravens coach John Harbaugh deliver a more pointed message, one more brick in a wall of integration: not bad for a quarterback.“To see how these kids have evolved from the era I played in and dispelled the myth that a black man could not think and throw and lead at that level, it’s just gratifying,” Briscoe said. “We’ve come so far. And it’s a long time coming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97560ce4debb7b6f027198c1df997f0860812f3b/0_97_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=061b2f86c4d074103981ea5b839fca2f","title":"ford farrell named as england go strong for world cup opener","story":"George Ford and Owen Farrell have been named together in England’s starting XV for their Rugby World Cup opener against Tonga, with Eddie Jones unleashing his first-choice side in Sapporo on Sunday.As reported by the  on Wednesday, Jones has opted to select his strongest side available despite hinting last week he would not, with Manu Tuilagi named at outside-centre as England stick with the same midfield trio who started in the record warm-up win over Ireland last month.In total, 13 of that side have been selected with Anthony Watson replacing Joe Cokanasiga, who has been carrying a knee injury, and in a somewhat surprising move in the second row, Courtney Lawes is selected ahead of George Kruis. Joe Marler has also been selected despite missing the majority of England’s training session on Wednesday.It is only the second time since last June that Jones has opted to pair Ford and Farrell together, but both shone against Ireland. Jones will also be mindful that selecting two playmakers enables England to adopt more of a passing game in the face of the expected physical onslaught from Tonga.“The focus this week has been about getting right for Tonga,” said Jones. “We have had a good seven days in Japan where we have acclimatised really well, our sleep patterns are good and the physical conditioning of the players is outstanding. We have been able to add a bit more on our team togetherness and cohesion, too.”Ford and Farrell is also a tried and tested partnership at 10-12 for Jones, who played the two together for all but one game of the 18-match winning run to start his tenure. He largely continued with it thereafter but after England were defeated the first two matches of last summer’s tour of South Africa – extended their losing run to five Tests – Jones turned to Danny Cipriani for one match only before installing Farrell as his No 1 fly-half.Elsewhere, Elliot Daly is at full-back with Anthony Watson and Jonny May on the wings while Ben Youngs is chosen at scrum-half. Joining Marler in the front row is Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler while Itoje is Lawes’s second-row partner.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIn the back-row, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill – dubbed the “Kamikaze Kids” by Jones – play their second match together having dovetailed to impressive effect against Ireland. Billy Vunipola is at No8 against the country of his heritage while Lewis Ludlam is on the bench. Neither Mark Wilson nor Cokanasiga, who have both been carrying knee problems, are in the 23-man squad.Joining Ludlam among the replacements is Kruis as well as the front-row trio of Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge and Dan Cole. Willi Heinz is the replacement scrum-half while Henry Slade and Jonathan Joseph are both also in the squad with the Exeter centre set for his first outing since 2 June having recovered from a knee injury.“Now it is about putting in a game plan against Tonga and it is important to be tactically right,” added Jones. “We know they are going to be ferocious and full of pride and passion. They are a side if they get a bit of momentum they can be very dangerous and are well coached by Toutai Kefu. They have a great World Cup record and we will need to be at our best on Sunday.With his side for the opening encounter of England’s title quest now chosen, Jones turned his attention towards what awaits in Japan over the coming weeks. “The players have worked hard. Physically I haven’t seen them any better and off the field they’ve worked really hard to be a tight team. And that’s going to be tested in the World Cup because the World Cup is like a rollercoaster.“We are at the top of the ride now and we are looking down - everyone’s nervous, everyone’s excited. You go down the first slope and you’re not sure if you are going to throw up or hang on.“You’ve got to adapt to that and the players have equipped themselves to ride the rollercoaster because there’s going to be some turns, there’s going to be some accidents, there’s going to be some fun.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4cdfac777dfc00d410d4cea774997744f035b63/0_12_3763_2259/master/3763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f345942cab76ca3a309603dcc7cd7c","title":"talking horses circus maximus reprieve raises disqualification issue","story":"Romanised may have won at Longchamp under old rules, but occasional controversy is better than denying worthy winnersThe question of what, exactly, a horse and rider must do to an opponent to be disqualified from first place raises itself again, following news from France on Thursday evening. The connections of Romanised, the narrow runner-up in the Prix du Moulin 12 days ago, have failed in their appeal against the decision to allow Circus Maximus to keep the race.Romanised, who is trained by Ken Condon in Ireland, took the Prix Jacques le Marois in August and appeared to be on the verge of a swift Group One double approaching the final furlong of the Moulin as he moved alongside Circus Maximus and Ryan Moore. Circus Maximus then started to drift to his left, carrying Romanised with him.Having been shifted several horse-widths across the course, Romanised was still just a nose behind Circus Maximus at the line – but the Longchamp stewards did not take further action. Condon also suggested this week that he felt Romanised had received a bump close to the line, forcing him to switch leads and lose more vital momentum.Until the end of 2017, Romanised would have been highly likely to get the win on the day in these circumstances. Until then, France was the last major racing nation which used a “Category 2” interpretation of interference. Under it, demotion for the horse causing the problems, to behind the runner it had impeded, was largely automatic.In 2018, however, France joined Britain, Ireland, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan in taking a “Category 1” approach. This means the stewards must be satisfied that a horse causing interference has improved its placing as a result before they will order the placings to be amended.Category 1 tends to be seen as the more punter (and spectator) friendly way to proceed, as it reduces the number of amendments and helps to stop easy, worthy winners being disqualified for interference early in a race. These still crop up with some regularity in the US, where major jurisdictions retain a Category 2 approach.But it does not stop disqualifications altogether and the significant distance that Circus Maximus appeared to have carried Romanised across the course, allied to the extremely narrow margin of victory, looked like very strong grounds for a reversal of the placings to many observers on the day.The stewards decided that the two horses had drifted left largely independently and used footage from a camera inside the track to conclude that Circus Maximus was finishing faster at the line. As a result, they could not be satisfied that he would have finished second but for the interference in the closing stages.Thursday’s appeal, according to a press release from France Galop on Thursday evening, “was heard in a fair play atmosphere”, but added that their stewards, “after showing all the views of the incident and hearing both parties make their points in detail,” allowed the original result to stand.There are just four meetings for punters to consider rather than the six that are standard on Fridays through the summer, but there are eight-race meetings at both Newbury and Ayr, where the 25-runner Ayr Bronze Cup offers the most daunting challenge on the card. The general wisdom is that low numbers have an edge on Ayr’s sprint course but this race has been won from a high stall several times in recent years and Shallow Hal (3.45), the top weight, is interesting from 24 from where the front-runner Pendleton, in 25, should give him a tow. He has had a break since running well in a strong race at York in June, has been dropped a couple of pounds in the interim and took a nursery over track and trip here last year. Isabeau (2.40) will be hard to beat earlier on the card now that Mrs Bouquet is an absentee, while Fairy Falcon (3.15) deserves a chance to back up her apparent improvement last time. Tabarrak will go off at a short price in the Listed Dubai Duty Free Cup at Newbury having been touched off in valuable handicaps on his last two starts, but he does not have quite as much in hand of his field as odds-on quotes might suggest. Makzeem (3.55) would certainly give him a race on the form of his course-and-distance win in July, while for a runner with an each-way chance at a very big price, look no further than George Of Hearts (5.05) as he makes his debut for George Baker with Cieren Fallon in the plate. He did not show much form for Richard Hannon earlier in the year but is down 9lb in the ratings since April and would be very competitive if back to anything like his best. A price of around 18-1 looks too big.Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd32ec5b0603c2a0624c9514a38e2f4a09432e9/0_35_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb0cd7394b49de75b14e628ef3d45dd2","title":"rugby world cup 2019 opening ceremony japan v russia live","story":"Groups of children representing each competing team are now ringed around Mount Fuji.

Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used inidually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: playpause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.Pros: great sound, noise cancelling, super comfortable, brilliant case, aptX and Bluetooth 5, long battery life, solid connectivity, small and attractive.Cons: no AAC support, no volume control on buds, problem with wind noise, noise cancelling not the best.

It hasn’t worked.I used my phone for an average of 4 hours and 2 minutes a day last week, picking it up 103 times a day. That’s about once every 10 minutes while I am awake. And for what? Pokémon Go (yes, I am addicted), social networking and reading – in that order. And when I’m not on my phone, I am on my laptop.If this sounds familiar, and somewhat nauseating, meet the Light Phone.Launched this month after a wildly successful crowdfunding campaign, Light Phone is a credit card-sized phone that only lets you make calls and text. That’s it. The first version of Light Phone was calls only and proved too much for even the most hardened minimalist. The second version, to be released soon, will allow users to use maps or summon an Uber or Lyft but its creators, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang, say they will never add email or any social media.“Remember the old days when you sat down at your computer and you were connected, and then you stood up and you were disconnected. There was a clear separation,” says Hollier. “Now you’re connected 247. This isn’t what I wanted.”The point of the Light Phone is to let you leave your smartphone at home (or as Tang does, in his bag) and live more of your life in the – shudder – real world.My plan was to use it for a week, leave my iPhone at home or on my desk, only using it when I could as easily have used my laptop.It proved surprisingly hard – but not for the reasons I expected.Initially, panic came in waves. What if I missed that big email or an urgent message from family and friends? I had told the office and my significant others I was on phone or text only, but that didn’t stop me worrying.The extent of my dependency was manifest all week, and it’s little wonder – all this screen time is rewiring our brains. We now lose concentration quicker than a goldfish (eight seconds for us, nine for the goldfish, according to one study). To my horror, I find myself reaching for the Light Phone, even though I know it does nothing, like an ex-smoker patting his pockets for his lighter. As a post-work drink with colleagues turns from gossip to football, I automatically reach for it to distract myself from sport banter before realising I have to suffer in silence. Every quiet moment, I wanted to check my phone. What the hell do I do when I need a poo? Do I now need one of those “toilet books”?Often, cravings are about my “need” for information. Out for pizza with my boyfriend, Larry, we start discussing the 2020 elections and Florida. How many Puerto Ricans moved there after Hurricane Maria? Will they tip the balance? I want to check my phone. The conversation shifts to Brexit. Ditto. I want my phone. And when Larry goes to the bathroom, leaving me alone at the table, you guessed it – I want my phone. I am sensing a pattern. Even watching TV I miss my phone. When was the last time I watched something without the distraction of a second screen? We are watching the TV show Legion. Who plays Syd’s mum? I saw her in something recently and she was great. Google would have told me in seconds. The feeling passes.Later, Gen James Mattis is on promoting his no-tell memoir. His hair is cut high, tight and slicked to his head with martial precision. Does Mattis ask for “a Mattis” when he goes to the hairdresser? Is he conscious this is a style? Unable to type away on my phone, I draw a picture of Mattis and – for some reason – Mount Fuji in my notebook. I used to draw a lot. I am drawing again. A lot of Easter Island heads, people on the subway, flowers. They are rubbish but this feels better than my phone.By midweek, I’m also writing more. At least these thoughts and drawings, however scattered, are my own. Maybe a new me is emerging, or an old one. One that draws and thinks for himself rather than following Silicon Valley’s addictive maze.Of course, there are problems. Without a book, the subway is not great (but then, the subway never is). On my way to work, a man starts screaming at fellow passengers: “Get the fuck away from me. This is MY space. You wanna go to female jail? You wanna go to female jail?” The phone is the perfect defense against the forced intimacy of the subway. Sitting quietly and making sure not to make eye contact, I wait for my stop. Everyone else stares even more intently at their screens.I am better prepared for my trip to the department of motor vehicles (DMV). Everyone knows the DMV is one of the outer circles of hell, and only a fool would enter unprepared. The first problem is that I thought I knew where it was. I didn’t – and didn’t have access to Google Maps. Lost in Midtown, I am considering whether to scrap the whole thing or walk back to the office to check directions on my laptop when I have an idea: I could ask someone. I pop into Nordstrom and ask the security guard. He knows!Laughably, I have chosen a DMV “Express” to renew my license. When I arrive I am assigned ticket number R775. The board is up to R695 – 80 people ahead of me. There are no seats. Everyone is on their phone. I sit on the floor and bring out my secret weapon: Frank O’Hara’s Lunch Poems. Pocketable and lovely.“where does the evil of the year goand turns it into ozone stalagmitesdeposits of light”Has anyone been better on New York?After two hours, I admit I am bored. I miss emojis – the book doesn’t have them. And typing on the tiny screen is a bore. The screen is minuscule, I need my glasses, there are no emojis. I can’t be bothered to send or reply to messages. But am I more bored than I would be with my little iFriend? No, I don’t think so. Nor do I see anyone else really LOLing it up despite all their screen time.On the way home, I am treated to a spectacular sunset. Manhattan washed in red and gold. So many people are snapping pics for Instagram – they will all be crap – while I am enjoying the now and especially how stupid they all look. Oh the delicious sense of superiority!At the end of the week, I go to the launch party for the Light Phone in Soho. There are a lot of smartphones and a lot of people not feeling great about them. James Russo, a marketing exec, plans to ditch his smartphone entirely once he gets a Light. “I eliminated Facebook and Instagram but I still find ways to kill time on my phone. It’s such a time suck,” he says.Amina Sule, a textile designer, says she spends two or three hours a day on her phone and she wants the time back. “As much as I try to stop doing it, I just find it creeping back,” she says. “I need something like this to manage it.”Will they ever be able to turn back the clock and go Light? Probably not. They’ll be too busy meeting the needs of people who can drop $350 on a second phone. But for me, it’s a possibility, perhaps. Maybe I’ll use the Light Phone and carry the iPhone in my bag. It feels like cheating but I want options.At the party Tang asks me how my week has been. His has been great – they have 50,000 people on the waitlist. I tell him it feels a little like swimming nude. Fun, slightly naughty, not always appropriate, but something I will definitely do again. I may carry my swimming trunks, though. Just in case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5e122864e954b50986b61367e75eb6073a32290/233_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=515e524343e528bfe8c437ee66e3b37b","title":"emmys 2019 game of thrones television","story":"A host-less ceremony pits the isive final season of the awards juggernaut against fresher contendersThe isive final season of Game of Thrones is set to do battle for one last time this weekend as it heads into the Emmys with a record 32 nominations.HBO’s hit fantasy drama has already beaten Frasier to become the most awarded scripted television series in Emmys history, and after winning last year’s trophy for outstanding drama, it’s predicted to do the same again. Earlier this month, the show picked up 10 awards at the Creative Arts Emmys that reward technical achievement, a strong sign of Academy support.But America’s biggest night of television is also set to be one of its most competitive. While the final seasons of awards stalwarts Game of Thrones and Veep may well go out with a bang, they face off against an acclaimed set of newcomers, including Succession, Pose, Killing Eve, Fleabag, Schitt’s Creek and Bodyguard. Earlier this year at the Golden Globes, Killing Eve’s Sandra Oh and Bodyguard’s Richard Madden beat out their more established and frequently nominated competitors.Game of Thrones also enters the fray after arguably its most critically unpopular season. If the show does dominate Sunday’s ceremony it will represent a bittersweet victory for HBO, which has yet to replicate the show’s success with any of its blockbuster follow-ups. The network is currently in production for a prequel series starring Naomi Watts.The Selma director’s acclaimed drama about the Central Park Five boasts 11 nominations but faces off in one of the toughest categories of the night, for limited series, against ratings hit Chernobyl. “The international reception to Chernobyl took many industry insiders by surprise,” nominated star Jared Harris said. “My hope is that its impact emboldens programmers to keep taking risks to not only delight, but also challenge their audiences.”After a mixed reception for last year’s hosts, Saturday Night Live duo Colin Jost and Michael Che, this year has followed on from many awards shows in the past year by going host-less. Producer Don Mischer has claimed the decision will allow the show, airing this year on Fox, to be “a little more unpredictable”. Presenters this year include Angela Bassett, Gwyneth Paltrow, Naomi Watts, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Viola Davis, Ben Stiller and the cast of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.“If you have a host and an opening, that’s 15 or 20 minutes you can‘t have to salute the shows,” Fox Entertainment’s chief executive, Dan Collier, said. “This is a pretty unique year for some of America’s favorite shows going away.” The night is set to include on-stage cast reunions for both Game of Thrones and Veep.In recent years, the red carpet has been enlivened with political fashion statements and on Sunday, many stars are reported to be showing their support for the Memphis-based non-profit St Jude children’s research hospital. Hollywood costume designer Arianne Phillips has created a gold pin which has been distributes to stars in attendance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6cf3e79c1489963084526d6063a7b6957fe991/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492e3e4b276fd65f4fac28e087e8fcf2","title":"justin trudeau wearing blackface details emerge third incident","story":"Footage emerges of third instance of Canadian prime minister in blackface, with one month to go before election• How will Justin Trudeau’s blackface photos affect Canada’s election?Justin Trudeau is scrambling to halt further damage to his re-election campaign after a string of racist images from his past put Canada’s image-conscious prime minister at the centre of yet another scandal.Less than five weeks before the federal election on 21 October, the Liberal leader’s campaign was rocked when images emerged of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup.On Thursday, new video emerged of a third instance of Trudeau in blackface – just hours after he had apologized for wearing what he described as “racist” makeup to a costume party in 2001.The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which, Trudeau – his face, arms and legs painted black – waves at the camera and sticks his tongue out. The opposition Conservative party – currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau’s Liberals – confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week.Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup. “I am wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,” he told reporters in Winnipeg. A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did “knowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was”.The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin – complete with dark skin makeup and a turban – at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher.Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song.“I apologise profoundly,” Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. “I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.“I’m pissed off at myself. I’m disappointed in myself,” he said.Opposition politicians reacted swiftly, saying the decades-old images called into question Trudeau’s judgment, his commitment to ersity – and his fitness to lead the country.“How do you look someone in the eye that has mocked the lived reality that I have lived – but, more importantly, what a lot of Canadians have lived,” said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party.The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer – Trudeau’s main opponent – said he was “shocked and disappointed” and claimed the prime minister had “lied” in his apology to Canadians.But Scheer has also faced calls in recent weeks to eject members from within his own party for racist or homophobic statements. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions – a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau.The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”, saying the prime minister must commit to learning better social justice leadership at “all levels of government”.Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP in Quebec and member of the federal Black Caucus, said he was “hopeful” the incident could help spur “nuanced” conversations about systemic racism in Canada.“I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for ersity,” Fergus said.“What Justin Trudeau did was wrong. He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,” Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario’s Liberal party, tweeted. “This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.”Others, were less forgiving of the prime minister’s previous actions.“The privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step. You should be aware of the history of #blackface and racism in this country and others. Apparently #ersityisourstrength? Deeply disappointed,” tweeted former colleague Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who left the Liberal party in March 2019.After his landslide electoral victory in 2015, Trudeau was praised for his apparent commitment to ersity and inclusion, as well as polices which appeared to offer an explicit rebuke to those of Donald Trump: he quickly named a young and ethnically erse cabinet and initially welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees.But he is fighting for his second parliamentary majority against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal: earlier this year Canada’s ethics watchdog found that Trudeau broke the country’s conflict of interest law when he allegedly pressured his attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.Trudeau’s Liberal is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives in terms of the popular vote, but they hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.It remains unclear how the images will affect the prime minister, whose political career has benefited as much from his carefully curated public persona as from his policies.When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn’t entertain “hypotheticals” and that each incident would be viewed on a “case-by-case basis”.Asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: “I’m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0883f10a11ac5e81e0c143ee790b95a6be85f412/634_422_6073_3644/master/6073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95febd79c51c5b19c4a02b6289549e0","title":"netanyahu urges rival gantz join him unity government","story":"Blue and White leader rejects offer to serve under Likud after close-run Israeli electionBenjamin Netanyahu is furiously manoeuvring to cling to office after his rival Benny Gantz refused to serve under him in a government of national unity following an inconclusive election.Neither bloc has an obvious path to form a majority coalition, and Netanyahu called for them to join together in a unity government, hinting that he might be willing to accept a power-sharing arrangement with Gantz, a precedent found in the rotation of the prime minister’s office between Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres in the mid-1980s.Gantz, a former military chief, said he should lead the next government because his alliance won the most seats.“The country has chosen unity. The country has chosen Israel first,” Gantz said on Thursday. “Blue and White, headed by me, has won the election … I am interested in and intend to form a broad and liberal unity government, under my leadership. A government that will convey the will of the people. A paralysed national government does not benefit the people.”Moshe Ya’alon, a senior Blue and White figure, was blunt, telling reporters: “We will not enter a coalition led by Netanyahu.”Netanyahu said he was “surprised and disappointed” by the rejection.Bolstering his opponents’ case that the election was a referendum on the prime minister, polling suggested that Netanyahu and Likud had lost support in its former strongholds.While the struggle to form coalition governments has long been a feature of Israel’s fractious politics, it has been further complicated by the presence of the deeply polarising figure of Netanyahu.In two weeks’ time he will face pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant the 69-year-old – who denies any wrongdoing – immunity from prosecution.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.Netanyahu has worked hard to make sure that blame for the failure of a deal with Gantz – which would raise the prospects of an unprecedented third round of elections – is apportioned to his rival.While weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government lay ahead, conditions set by the parties could hobble the task within the allotted time, prompting a third election.Neither side appeared to be able to form a government of at least 61 seats without the support of the election’s apparent kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman of the Yisrael Beitenu party.His insistence on a secular government would force out Netanyahu’s traditional allies, the country’s two ultra-Orthodox parties and another nationalist-religious party.Reuven Rivlin, the country’s president, promised on Thursday to do everything in his power to prevent a third election.The deadlock follows the second Israeli elections this year, which were called because Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition after the April vote. Israelis endured a caustic campaign with a combative Netanyahu fighting for his political survival.This week’s vote was largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who this summer surpassed Israel’s founding prime minister to become the country’s longest-serving leader. During the campaign, Netanyahu cast himself as a seasoned statesman who was the only candidate able to steer Israel through a sea of challenges.Gantz, a former army chief, tried to paint Netanyahu as isive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and honest alternative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b786358af680269036aa921d241f0d17d72f92df/0_4_1392_835/master/1392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d1eb5f4c4d87ab6dfe4d191bee4bd45","title":"new zealand insect named after hobbit frodo baggins from lord of the rings psylla frodobaggins","story":"The newly classified species Psylla Frodobaggins is found on the South Island, where the Tolkein movies were filmedNew Zealand researchers have named an insect after JRR Tolkein’s famous hobbit character Frodo Baggins. Like the famous literary character, the insect is smaller than its relations and is found in New Zealand’s South Island, the location where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies were filmed.The Psylla frodobagginsi was identified by Francesco Martoni and Karen Armstrong, who examined the psyllid insects during research for Martoni’s PhD, with the New Zealand’s Bio-Protection Research Centre.It is not the first time Kiwi insects have been named after hobbits. In 2013 scientists discovered a new species of wasp that were small, short and stout and named them after Bilbo, Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Sam.During their research, the pair also solved an 87-year-old mystery about why there was so much variation in what is called the kōwhai psyllid. There are in fact two different varieties of psyllid: the Psylla apicalis and the slightly smaller Psylla frodobagginsi.For his PhD research, Martoni examined psyllids collected from kōwhai trees in 21 South Island locations and described consistent differences between two types, which allowed them to be classified as two distinct species.“Psylla frodobagginsi can be identified most easily by its small dimension, light colours, and uniformly spotted wings,” the authors wrote in their paper outlining the research.“Psylla frodobagginsi is smaller than P. apicalis, with males as small as 1.24 mm, compared to the 1.65mm of P. apicalis, and females as small as 1.56 mm, against the 2.03 mm of P. Apicalis.”The name is likely to be seen as an improvement on the psyllids’ more common name of jumping plant lice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc4c13431b0de5c9822d6f2ccff7f8f843481249/0_2429_3234_1939/master/3234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a39660805d0b15a4773d8339d46c7cb1","title":"taiwan loses second ally in a week as kiribati switches to china","story":"Pacific nation changes allegiance to Beijing just days after Solomon Islands also cut ties with Taipei Taiwan has lost its second diplomatic ally in less than a week after the Pacific nation of Kiribati moved to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan and establish foreign relations with China.The decision comes after the Solomon Islands announced it was breaking away from Taiwan on Monday, and means that in just a week the number of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies has dropped from 17 to 15.Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu announced on Friday that the country was cutting diplomatic ties with Kiribati and immediately closing its embassy in the country. In a statement, he said Taiwan “rejects and strongly condemns” Kiribati for disregarding the long-standing relationship and aid provided by Taiwan and accused Kiribati’s president Taneti Mamau of entertaining “highly unrealistic expectations regarding China” and requesting “massive financial assistance from Taiwan to purchase commercial airplanes”, which Taiwan did not feel was consistent with its aid policy.Taiwan made the announcement before the Kiribati government formally announced its decision to cut ties with Taiwan in a pre-emptive move, as it did ahead of the Solomon Islands announcing their switch.The move will be a “significant blow” to Taiwan, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands Program. Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 since the election of president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China.“Another one bites the dust in the Pacific,” said Pryke. “It’s certainly not a good week for Taiwan, losing two of your remaining 17 diplomatic allies in one week, and two with the largest populations in the Pacific.”Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control. Taiwan is self-ruled, but China considers it a wayward province and will not have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a state.Over the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific.The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where, until this week, formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances.Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas), a country of 115,000 people in the south Pacific, was the largest of Taiwan’s Pacific allies in terms of population after the Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people, cut ties with the country earlier this week.Kiribati’s decision leaves Taiwan with four remaining Pacific allies: Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau and Marshall Islands as well as allies in the Caribbean and Latin America.China’s concerted attempt to peel allies away from Taipei could be seen putting pressure on Tsai, who is pro-Taiwanese sovereignty, ahead of the upcoming election in Taiwan in January.After the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan, the US said it would consider cutting aid to the Solomon Islands in retribution.Gloria Steele, acting assistant administrator of USAID’s Asia bureau, told a House budget hearing: “We are reassessing our assistance to the Solomon Islands at this point.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWe want to get a deal ... but we cannot allow Ireland to be the collateral damage\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash CoveneyFrench authorities are searching for ownerMinister says there have been arrests, there are files with the DPP over attacksHeavy rain is expected on Saturday nightEx-IRA man Des Long talks about his support for violence, and Gerry Adams\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquobetrayal\u0026rsquoFocus will be on home benefits package with support for gas and electricity billsKidnapping of QIH chief operations officer prompts shock and silence in Co FermanaghGovernment sources taken aback by tone and content of Steve Barclay\u0026rsquos speechGreta Thunberg will lead biggest march in New York after making impact in CongressF\u0026oacutersa warns of \u0026lsquosignificant\u0026rsquo work-to-rule action by secretaries following the protestExtent of reduced consumption depends on where data shown, new research indicatesIrish Prison Service report notes rise in the number of inmates with \u0026lsquosevere\u0026rsquo mental illnessesPSNI and garda\u0026iacute rushed to homes of other executives on learning of abductionThe dozen attackers have strong links to republican groups involved in extortionCreed urges farmers to \u0026lsquostep away from blockades\u0026rsquo as beef deal stallsMove to reverse disparity between male and female retirement incomes, claims GovernmentState is also becoming a safer place to give birth, with consistent improvements this century in maternal mortalityHugh Gerard Coney (24) was shot dead in 1974 as he attempted to escape from the jail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4024109.1568928644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the brits never left any place until they were driven out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDes Long on A Secret History, a BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight series on the Troubles.

I feel you wouldn’t be going any place without a military campaign,” he says.Forty years on, he insists the British cannot be trusted.“You can talk to the Brits until you are blue in the face,” he says. “They’ll keep you talking and going around in circles.”One can “talk”, he says, but, “don’t have a truce”.Twenty years on from the Belfast Agreement, in the run-up to Brexit, Long knows he is in a minority. He does not care.“Fight and talk. When people read this, they’ll think I’m mad,” he says, with a shrug of his shoulders.British army watchtowers, once a feature of the Northern Irish landscape during the Troubles, can return at any stage, he says.“They may not be parading around in the streets, but they are here. They can get plane-loads of them over in hours.”In 1969 Long and others split from the Official IRA, forming a provisional army council during a meeting at a house in Victor Fagg’s house in Athlone, Co Westmeath.For 17 years, he was general secretary of the IRA executive.“I must be the longest ever,” he says.Later he was on the ardchomhairle of Sinn Féin, and on the National H-Block Committee.He split from Sinn Féin and Gerry Adams in 1986 – opposed to the party leadership’s initial attempts to persuade the IRA to give up its guns – to join Republican Sinn Féin.However, he left this group, too, in 2000 after differences emerged.Adams denialsAdams\u0027s denials infuriate Long, who bangs the table with his fist to show his feelings.By denying IRA membership, Adams betrays every IRA volunteer who fought for a united Ireland, Long argues.\u0026nbspHe looks distressed when he produces a newspaper article from 2013, with the headline ‘Those killed by IRA were murdered, says Adams’.He hopes he will witness a united Ireland: “I’m hoping it will happen in my lifetime, although I’m pushing on now. I’ll be 80 next May, if I live that long, unless somebody . . . Nobody wants to die, but sure we all have to die eventually.”He does not know, he says, if a united Ireland will come.“I never thought it would be easy.”However, old beliefs will not be abandoned now. “I’ll be a republican until the day I die. Whether people want me or not is another thing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4022671.1568826278!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"much heat but little light in pursuit of brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has been told by EU leaders proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty. Photograph: GettyOn Friday it will be 30 days since German chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson during a Berlin news conference that a solution to the Brexit impasse could maybe be found within 30 days.Johnson, seizing on her remarks, welcomed the “blistering timetable” and declared “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) a “Yes we can!” type phrase previously used by Merkel about the refugee crisis.And off he went. On that swing through European capitals, Johnson seemed to impress Merkel and later French president Emmanuel Macron with his desire to agree a new deal with the EU. Last week, he did the same with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.But what Merkel and Macron, Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker (don’t mention Xavier Bettel) and every other EU leader to whom he has spoken have said to Johnson is that those proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty.But 29 days on, there has been no sign of British proposals which do anything of the sort. As EU leaders note with increasing irritation, nothing concrete has been tabled by the British government which could serve as a basis for negotiations with the EU.Neither have the British tabled workable solutions in the technical discussions that continue between Downing Street officials and the European Commission – meetings that Johnson now wants to intensify so that they take place every day. While Brussels sources wonder for what? A series of British ministers – most recently new Northern Secretary Julian Smith – have floated various ideas to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, as reported in Wednesday’s .But several senior Irish sources are clear as a whistle on these ideas and concepts: none of them go remotely far enough towards establishing a workable alternative to the backstop. In other words, not alone are there no negotiations on a new deal going on, we are quite a distance away from the starting point for such negotiations. Speculation as to whether Johnson is serious about wanting a deal comes and goes in Dublin and in Brussels. Some politicians and officials expect British proposals to replace the backstop to be tabled late in the day, with a frantic period of negotiating against the deadline of a no-deal Brexit looming. Others say this is all just part of a strategy to avoid the blame for no deal. What, if anything, is taking shape? Johnson has claimed the shape of a deal is becoming clearer. And despite protestations it appears that if there is to be a deal it will be a Northern Ireland-specific solution that involves treating the North differently from the rest of the UK, in some respects. There may be a role for Stormont to give it democratic legitimacy in Northern Ireland. It will include an all-Ireland food and agriculture zone (eliminating the requirement for animals to be checked on the Border) and a series of measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, checks on goods at a business level and other arrangements designed to reduce cross-Border friction.However, senior Irish sources familiar with Government deliberations say that even if the details of these measures were worked out – and they are not – they would be insufficient to replace the backstop.That is because the position of Theresa May’s government – that it would eliminate the need for a border – has been junked by Johnson and replaced with a commitment to try to make the Border as frictionless as possible. That is a very big difference. And it will make a deal very difficult to reach. The mood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

File Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou AFPGetty Images Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will meet with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michael Barnier, in Brussels after Jean-Claude Juncker insisted “we can have a deal” before the Halloween deadline.Mr Barclay will head to Brussels for talks with Michel Barnier on Friday following the European Commission president’s warm words, which will have buoyed hopes in Downing Street.Mr Juncker said his meeting with Boris Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday was “rather positive” as he assured he was “doing everything to have a deal” to prevent a “catastrophic” no-deal Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Juncker said “we can have a deal”, but was unable to put the chances at more than 5050 when pressed.Mr Juncker said that he has no “emotional relationship” with the Irish backstop, which aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland but has been a major sticking point to getting a deal through Parliament.“If the objectives are met – all of them – then we don’t need the backstop,” he added.Mr Barclay’s department said he will meet with Mr Barnier to “take stock” following discussions between the PM’s Europe adviser David Frost and Taskforce 50 – the EU unit dealing with the UK’s departure.A day earlier, Mr Barnier spoke with Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Stephen Kinnock, who are key in cross-party efforts to get a deal through parliament.Mr Kinnock told BBC’s Newsnight that they left feeling “relatively, cautiously optimistic” after the Brussels meeting because of mounting pressure on the PM.He said that the negotiator made it clear that a Northern Ireland-only backstop remained on the table.The EU’s original proposal, which was objected to by the DUP, would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU’s single market and customs union, but give Great Britain the freedom to strike trade deals.Also in the interview, Mr Barnier confirmed that he had received documents from Mr Johnson outlining draft ideas for a fresh Withdrawal Agreement late on Wednesday night.Non-papersDowning Street had said the UK has shared a series of “confidential technical non-papers” which reflect the ideas being put forward.Previously documents had been shown to Brussels officials, but then taken back at the end of meetings out of fears they would be leaked.But a “non-paper” is not a formal Government position and falls far short of what has been demanded by Brussels.Mr Johnson was under pressure from Finnish prime minister Antti Rinne to formally outline his plans to the EU by the end of September.Mr Rinne told reporters after meeting French president Emmanuel Macron that they “agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing – if they exist”.The UK government insisted Mr Johnson will not be bound by an “artificial deadline” to produce formal written proposals to resolve the Brexit deadlock.Mr Johnson said progress was being made, but the extent of it should not be exaggerated.“You heard Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday say that he doesn’t have any emotional attachment to the backstop,” Mr Johnson said.“Now that is progress – they weren’t saying that a month ago.”But Tánaiste Simon Coveney said a “big gap” remains between the UK and the bloc.“And in order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government which we simply haven’t received yet,” he said.Ahead of Friday’s meeting, Mr Barclay warned the EU against a “rigid” approach and suggested the final details of an alternative to the Irish backstop may not need to be resolved until the end of 2020.Mr Barclay said the Mr Johnson had shown he was willing to be “creative and flexible” by considering an all-Ireland approach to plant and animal checks, and suggested that it was now for the European Commission to shift its stance. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

In reality, it offers one new feature that’s radically different and others that reveal how useful they are the more you get to know them.Apple announced its new smart timepiece, called Apple Watch Series 5, alongside the new iPhone 11 in Cupertino, California. It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow\u0026nbspentirely different.The design itself hasn’t changed from last year. That’s no surprise because 2018’s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.The Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.First, there’s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the time of filming Apocalypse Now in 1979, Martin Sheen was drinking heavily and using drugs - so much so that, unbeknownst to the crew or his director Francis Ford Coppola, he had a heart attack in the middle of the jungle. Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him.Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God. The actor, attempting to slide down a tree, fractured his skull after falling 25 feet and hitting his head on a rock. Chan was immediately rushed into surgery and, to this day, he has a hole in his skull that he covers with a plastic plug.Michael J Fox famously came close to dying on the set of Back to the Future Part III in 1990. It was during a scene in which his character, Marty McFly, is hanged by the neck - something the crew permitted Fox to act out himself on the condition that he knew exactly where to place his hand when the noose was around his neck. Fox miscalculated, choking himself before passing out and was cut down after someone realised the actor was close to death.637 The kids in The Brady BunchWhile filming a 1973 episode of The Brady Bunch titled The Cincinnati Kids, the child stars of the hit TV show reportedly almost got caught up in a horrendous incident. As they were about to shoot a scene riding a rollercoaster - fit with a camera mounted to the front of the carriage - Mike Brady actor Robert Reed insisted crew carry out a test run. It\u0027s a good job he did - when the rollercoaster was in motion, the camera came loose and flew into the position the kids\u0027 heads would been had they been on board.Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul cheated death while filming the first season of Breaking Bad in 2008. Having asked for permission to move positions for a scene, the actor was left shaken after a boulder fell off the roof of a nearby RV directly onto the spot where he had just been standing.

If untreated, the infection can prove fatal.Gerard Butler had a close call while filming 2012 film Chasing Mavericks at a Northern California surfing spot renowned for its dangerous waters. The actor was knocked off his paddle by a powerful wave and submerged underwater until someone eventually came to his aid.  Doctor Who legend Elisabeth Sladen had a near-miss while filming the original series\u0027 four-part serial Revenge of the Cybermen, which aired in 1975. After driving a boat into a whirlpool, she was forced to e into the water after the boat lost control. Stuntman Terry Walsh came to her rescue.In the words of Tom Cruise\u0027s Edge of Tomorrow co-star Emily Blunt, speaking on US chat show Conan, about a car chase scene the duo filmed in 2014: “I hear Tom under his breath as I approach the right-hand turn, going \u0027Brake, brake, brake. Oh God. Brake, brake, brake. Brake it hard.\u0027 I left it too late, and drove us into a tree. I almost killed Tom Cruise.”British actor John Hurt was under so much prosthetic playing Joseph Merick in David Lynch\u0027s 1980 historical drama The Elephant Man that he almost suffocated. He was told to remain upright while wearing the makeup and would continually forget, almost losing his life in the process.British action hero Jason Statham escaped death on the set of 2014 action sequel The Expendables 3 after the brakes on a truck he was driving stopped working. He had no choice but to jump from the moving three-tonne vehicle seconds before it went into the Black Sea.Daniel Day-Lewis went into full method actor mode for his role as Buffalo Bill in Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 period drama Gangs of New York - so much so that he contracted pneumonia after refusing to wear clothes that didn\u0027t exist in the 19th century. In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn\u0027t exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn\u0027t. Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan’s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him. In a lucky twist of fate, his mauling was prevented when the bed the lion was perched on broke, distracting the creature and leaving enough time for the lion\u0027s trainer to tackle it to the ground.Kristen Chenoweth was cast in legal TV drama The Good Wife for its fourth season in 2013, but on her first day on set, a light fixture fell and hit her in the face. She was rushed to hospital having had her skull fractured, nose broken and teeth cracked, not to mention injuries to her spine and ribs. Chenoweth decided not to return to the show save for a cameo appearance in a later episode.Lorenza Izzo almost drowned while filming an escape attempt scene on the set of Eli Roth\u0027s 2013 horror film The Green Inferno. She was pushed downstream and the film\u0027s crew didn\u0027t realise her screams for help were real until it was almost too late. Roth reportedly used some of this footage in the finished film.Oscar-winning star Jennifer Lawrence was required to run through a tunnel on the set of 2012 young-adult novel adaptation The Hunger Games. However, a malfunction with a fog machine saw the enclosed area fill with so much smoke that Lawrence had to escape and came dangerously close to suffocating.Performing his own stunts as usual, Tom Cruise found himself in trouble on the set of 2003 film The Last Samurai when a mechanical horse he was required to jump on malfunctioned, leaving a blade held by his co-star Hiroyuki Sanada inches away from his neck. Johnny Depp was thrown from a horse on the set of Disney adventure The Lone Ranger (2013) and saw his life flash before his eyes after it proceeded to trample on him. Fortunately, it left him with mere bruises.While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one. The plan was to use the real knife for a fight sequence, right up until the moment of penetration as a collapsible one looked too fake. Somehow, the knives weren\u0027t swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he\u0027d put on at the very last minute.Dylan O\u0027Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure. During a stunt that required him to jump from the top of one car to another, the actor was dragged under the vehicle and suffered lacerations and fractures to his cheekbones and orbital sockets. His injuries were so serious that the film was delayed for an entire year and was eventually released in 2018.Brendan Fraser nearly died on the set of The Mummy in 1999 due to an incident that saw a hanging scene go terribly wrong.

Due to the intense filming conditions, he suffered from pneumonia, hypothermia and a lung infection - and even survived getting struck by lightning while filming the Sermon on the Mount scene. I was lit up like a Christmas tree, said Caviezel, who also dislocated his shoulder on set.As well as suffering a nasty injury on the set of Kill Bil Vol 2 due to a car malfunctioning, Uma Thurman had a near miss in a separate incident - also involving a car - while filming 2010 fantasy film Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware. Thankfully, her co-star Pierce Brosnan spotted it and jumped into the vehicle, slamming the brakes before it hit her. Those 007 skills certainly came in handy.As ever, Jackie Chan performed his own stunts for the first of his popular Hong King action series Police Story (1985). However, the climactic scene in the mall saw him crack two vertebrae, dislocate his pelvis and burn his hands in one moment that required him to slide down a pole from a large height.While filming high-octane thriller Premium Rush (2012), Joseph Gordon-Levitt collided with a taxi, leaving him in need of more than 30 stitches. Prison Break actor Dominic Purcell suffered a broken nose and head injury when an iron bar fell on his head while filming the revival series in 2016. He required 150 stitches.While filming the Red Dwarf episode Backwards in 1989, Craig Charles shot a scene that saw him walk out of a lake in reverse. Terrifyingly, the actor - who had weights in his pockets to stop him from floating - got his foot stuck and was held underwater until a rescue team saw him struggling.Sylvester Stallone has had many close shaves throughout his career, but the most life-threatening came while filming 1985 sequel Rocky IV. He asked his co-star Dolph Lundgren to knock him out and the resulting punch was so heavy that Stallone\u0027s rib cage was pushed into his chest, causing his heart to be compressed due to the swelling of his pericardial sac. He spent nine days in intensive care.  George Clooney\u0027s character was getting beaten up for a scene in 2005 drama Syriana when the actor ended up with an injury that bruised his brain.

Her injuries consisted of slipping a disc in her thoracic spine and chipping 11 of her vertebrae as well as dislocating her shoulder and tearing a rhomboid muscle. Alexander made it back to set a month later.During one of the more intense scenes in 1997 blockbuster Titanic, actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were running away from a large wave when Winslet\u0027s dress got caught on a grate and dragged her down.

At the time of filming Apocalypse Now in 1979, Martin Sheen was drinking heavily and using drugs - so much so that, unbeknownst to the crew or his director Francis Ford Coppola, he had a heart attack in the middle of the jungle. Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him.Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God. The actor, attempting to slide down a tree, fractured his skull after falling 25 feet and hitting his head on a rock. Chan was immediately rushed into surgery and, to this day, he has a hole in his skull that he covers with a plastic plug.Michael J Fox famously came close to dying on the set of Back to the Future Part III in 1990. It was during a scene in which his character, Marty McFly, is hanged by the neck - something the crew permitted Fox to act out himself on the condition that he knew exactly where to place his hand when the noose was around his neck. Fox miscalculated, choking himself before passing out and was cut down after someone realised the actor was close to death.637 The kids in The Brady BunchWhile filming a 1973 episode of The Brady Bunch titled The Cincinnati Kids, the child stars of the hit TV show reportedly almost got caught up in a horrendous incident. As they were about to shoot a scene riding a rollercoaster - fit with a camera mounted to the front of the carriage - Mike Brady actor Robert Reed insisted crew carry out a test run. It\u0027s a good job he did - when the rollercoaster was in motion, the camera came loose and flew into the position the kids\u0027 heads would been had they been on board.Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul cheated death while filming the first season of Breaking Bad in 2008. Having asked for permission to move positions for a scene, the actor was left shaken after a boulder fell off the roof of a nearby RV directly onto the spot where he had just been standing.

If untreated, the infection can prove fatal.Gerard Butler had a close call while filming 2012 film Chasing Mavericks at a Northern California surfing spot renowned for its dangerous waters. The actor was knocked off his paddle by a powerful wave and submerged underwater until someone eventually came to his aid.  Doctor Who legend Elisabeth Sladen had a near-miss while filming the original series\u0027 four-part serial Revenge of the Cybermen, which aired in 1975. After driving a boat into a whirlpool, she was forced to e into the water after the boat lost control. Stuntman Terry Walsh came to her rescue.In the words of Tom Cruise\u0027s Edge of Tomorrow co-star Emily Blunt, speaking on US chat show Conan, about a car chase scene the duo filmed in 2014: “I hear Tom under his breath as I approach the right-hand turn, going \u0027Brake, brake, brake. Oh God. Brake, brake, brake. Brake it hard.\u0027 I left it too late, and drove us into a tree. I almost killed Tom Cruise.”British actor John Hurt was under so much prosthetic playing Joseph Merick in David Lynch\u0027s 1980 historical drama The Elephant Man that he almost suffocated. He was told to remain upright while wearing the makeup and would continually forget, almost losing his life in the process.British action hero Jason Statham escaped death on the set of 2014 action sequel The Expendables 3 after the brakes on a truck he was driving stopped working. He had no choice but to jump from the moving three-tonne vehicle seconds before it went into the Black Sea.Daniel Day-Lewis went into full method actor mode for his role as Buffalo Bill in Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 period drama Gangs of New York - so much so that he contracted pneumonia after refusing to wear clothes that didn\u0027t exist in the 19th century. In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn\u0027t exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn\u0027t. Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan’s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him. In a lucky twist of fate, his mauling was prevented when the bed the lion was perched on broke, distracting the creature and leaving enough time for the lion\u0027s trainer to tackle it to the ground.Kristen Chenoweth was cast in legal TV drama The Good Wife for its fourth season in 2013, but on her first day on set, a light fixture fell and hit her in the face. She was rushed to hospital having had her skull fractured, nose broken and teeth cracked, not to mention injuries to her spine and ribs. Chenoweth decided not to return to the show save for a cameo appearance in a later episode.Lorenza Izzo almost drowned while filming an escape attempt scene on the set of Eli Roth\u0027s 2013 horror film The Green Inferno. She was pushed downstream and the film\u0027s crew didn\u0027t realise her screams for help were real until it was almost too late. Roth reportedly used some of this footage in the finished film.Oscar-winning star Jennifer Lawrence was required to run through a tunnel on the set of 2012 young-adult novel adaptation The Hunger Games. However, a malfunction with a fog machine saw the enclosed area fill with so much smoke that Lawrence had to escape and came dangerously close to suffocating.Performing his own stunts as usual, Tom Cruise found himself in trouble on the set of 2003 film The Last Samurai when a mechanical horse he was required to jump on malfunctioned, leaving a blade held by his co-star Hiroyuki Sanada inches away from his neck. Johnny Depp was thrown from a horse on the set of Disney adventure The Lone Ranger (2013) and saw his life flash before his eyes after it proceeded to trample on him. Fortunately, it left him with mere bruises.While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one. The plan was to use the real knife for a fight sequence, right up until the moment of penetration as a collapsible one looked too fake. Somehow, the knives weren\u0027t swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he\u0027d put on at the very last minute.Dylan O\u0027Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure. During a stunt that required him to jump from the top of one car to another, the actor was dragged under the vehicle and suffered lacerations and fractures to his cheekbones and orbital sockets. His injuries were so serious that the film was delayed for an entire year and was eventually released in 2018.Brendan Fraser nearly died on the set of The Mummy in 1999 due to an incident that saw a hanging scene go terribly wrong. According to his co-star Rachel Weisz, the actor stopped breathing and was in need of resuscitation as a result.Isla Fisher got stuck in a water thank for a scene in the 2013 heist thriller Now You See Me, with fellow cast members believing her screams to be the actions of her character. Luckily, she was pulled out - after a terrifying three minutes.Jim Caviezel had a tough time of it on the set of Mel Gibson\u0027s controversial 2004 film The Passion of the Christ. Due to the intense filming conditions, he suffered from pneumonia, hypothermia and a lung infection - and even survived getting struck by lightning while filming the Sermon on the Mount scene. I was lit up like a Christmas tree, said Caviezel, who also dislocated his shoulder on set.As well as suffering a nasty injury on the set of Kill Bil Vol 2 due to a car malfunctioning, Uma Thurman had a near miss in a separate incident - also involving a car - while filming 2010 fantasy film Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware. Thankfully, her co-star Pierce Brosnan spotted it and jumped into the vehicle, slamming the brakes before it hit her. Those 007 skills certainly came in handy.As ever, Jackie Chan performed his own stunts for the first of his popular Hong King action series Police Story (1985). However, the climactic scene in the mall saw him crack two vertebrae, dislocate his pelvis and burn his hands in one moment that required him to slide down a pole from a large height.While filming high-octane thriller Premium Rush (2012), Joseph Gordon-Levitt collided with a taxi, leaving him in need of more than 30 stitches. Prison Break actor Dominic Purcell suffered a broken nose and head injury when an iron bar fell on his head while filming the revival series in 2016. He required 150 stitches.While filming the Red Dwarf episode Backwards in 1989, Craig Charles shot a scene that saw him walk out of a lake in reverse. Terrifyingly, the actor - who had weights in his pockets to stop him from floating - got his foot stuck and was held underwater until a rescue team saw him struggling.Sylvester Stallone has had many close shaves throughout his career, but the most life-threatening came while filming 1985 sequel Rocky IV. He asked his co-star Dolph Lundgren to knock him out and the resulting punch was so heavy that Stallone\u0027s rib cage was pushed into his chest, causing his heart to be compressed due to the swelling of his pericardial sac. He spent nine days in intensive care.  George Clooney\u0027s character was getting beaten up for a scene in 2005 drama Syriana when the actor ended up with an injury that bruised his brain. A chair the actor was tied to was pushed over and Clooney was left with chronic headaches that he eventually had healed in surgery.Icelandic-born American star Gunnar Hansen was chasing his co-stars with a real chainsaw while filming 1974 horror film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre when he almost died. One day, he slipped in mud and sent the running chainsaw flying into the air - when it landed, it was inches from his head.Jaime Alexander was filming 2012 sequel Thor: The Dark World when she slipped and fell on a metal staircase, luckily avoiding paralysis.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there.

Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.

I knew that he was, in this really awkward, uncomfortable way, trying to give me a compliment. It never went further than that.”Created with Sketch.34 actors who regret big roles Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted? I have, and The Help is on that list, she told The New York Times. I want to know what it feels like to work for white people and to bring up children in 1963, I want to hear how you really feel about it. I never heard that in the course of the movie.”The Transformers franchise may have grossed billions of dollars at the box-office, but critics have never looked kindly upon the films. Neither has Megan Fox, who told Entertainment Weekly that “people are well aware that this is not a movie about acting”. She also previously took aim at director Michael Bay, saying: “He wants to be like Hitler on his sets, and he is, so he\u0027s a nightmare to work for.” Fox later retracted the comment, calling it “righteous anger” that should have not been made public. Knocked Up remains one of Katherine Heigl’s best-known roles, despite the actor having said she found the whole thing “a little sexist. It paints the women as shrews, as humourless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys,” she told Vanity Fair. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.Few people knew who Idris Elba was before The Wire. Despite the acclaim that came from playing Stringer Bell on the hugely popular crime show, Elba has some regrets. We\u0027re all idolising Stringer Bell, but who are we really idolising? he asked David Lammy while appearing on James O’Brien’s podcast. Are we idolising a smart drug dealer or a dumb narcotics dealer? What are we saying here? Is it OK to pump a community full of heroin but because you\u0027re smart at it, that makes you cool? That was a problem for me.There are famously seven cuts of Blade Runner. One of those features Harrison Ford’s character, Rick Deckard, narrating scenes. Another – the one director Ridley Scott approves of – is bleaker and does not have Deckard explaining events. Ford does not care for either version. I didn\u0027t like the movie one way or the other, with or without,” he said in 2017, before the release of Blade Runner 2049. “I played a detective who did not have any detecting to do. In terms of how I related to the material, I found it very difficult. There was stuff that was going on that was really nuts.For a time, many people were not sure whether Daniel Craig would return as James Bond for the 25th film in the series. I\u0027d rather break this glass and slash my wrists,” he told Time Out of returning to the role. “No, not at the moment. Not at all. That\u0027s fine. I\u0027m over it at the moment. We\u0027re done. All I want to do is move on. Apparently a big enough pay cheque got him back in the tuxedo. I\u0027ll be honest, I f**king hate that movie,” Channing Tatum said of GI Joe. “I was pushed into doing it. The script wasn’t any good. And I didn’t want to do something that I – that I was a fan of since I was a kid and watched every morning growing up – and didn\u0027t want to do something that was, one, bad. And two, I just didn’t know if I wanted to be GI Joe.Most actors who regret taking on roles would wait a few years until publicly bemoaning their experience on set. Not Robert Pattinson. Before the final Twilight film was in cinemas, the actor said of playing the vampire heartthrob Edward Cullen: It’s weird kind of representing something you don\u0027t particularly like. A few weeks later, he added how he would have “mindlessly hated the series had he not appeared in it.While superhero movies may now be Oscar Best Picture contenders (Black Panther), there was a time when playing a dex-wearing vigilante was anything but prestigious. Jessica Alba was one of the first people to jump on the superhero boom of the mid-Noughties, playing Invisible Woman in Fantastic Four. The experience, though, left her wanting to quit acting altogether. I hated it. I really hated, she told Elle. I remember when I was dying in Silver Surfer. The director was like, \u0027It looks too real. It looks too painful. Can you be prettier when you cry? Cry pretty, Jessica\u0027.Ryan Reynolds has never watched Green Lantern all the way through. That has not stopped the actor being highly critical of the superhero role, going as far as having Deadpool – who he later played – shoot a fictional version of himself in the head for taking on the role. Ouch.Kate Winslet does not mind Titanic as a film. Her performance as Rose is a completely different matter. Every single scene, I\u0027m like \u0027really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God’. Even my American accent, I can\u0027t listen to it. It\u0027s awful, she told the . Hopefully it\u0027s so much better now. It sounds terribly self-indulgent but actors do tend to be very self-critical. I have a hard time watching any of my performances, but watching Titanic I was just like, \u0027Oh God, I want to do that again.\u0027“I hated that film with a vengeance and could not believe how bad it was,” Michelle Pfeiffer said of the sequel to Grease. At the time I was young and didn\u0027t know any better. Thankfully, Pfeiffer\u0027s nose for a good script improved rapidly, with her next film being Brian De Palma\u0027s cult classic Scarface. Halle Berry remains one of the few actors to accept her Golden Raspberry award in person. Thank you so much. I never in my life thought I would be up here,” she told the audience, before spoofing her own Oscar acceptance speech and thanking her manager. He loves me so much that he convinces me to do projects even when he knows that it is shit. Meeeeeow. 1434 Christopher Plummer – The Sound of MusicThe Sound of Music remains one of the most beloved films of all time. Christopher Plummer, though, hated playing Captain von Trapp. “I think the part in The Sound of Music was the toughest,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “Because it was so awful and sentimental and gooey. You had to work terribly hard to try and infuse some miniscule bit of humour into it.”Another big-name actor who regrets taking on a mid-Noughties superhero role. Ben Affleck has remained an ardent Daredveil detractor. Daredevil didn\u0027t work at all, the actor told Entertainment Weekly in 2007. “If I wanted to go viral, I would be less polite. That was before people realised you could make these movies and make them well. There was a cynical sense of ‘put a red leather outfit on a guy, have him run around, hunt some bad guys, and cash the cheque’.”1634 Sylvester Stallone – Stop, or Mom Will ShootOne of Hollywood’s many iconic actors, Sylvester Stallone will always be remembered for both the Rocky and Rambo films. Less so Stop, or Mom Will Shoot, the 1992 buddy-cop comedy that teamed Stallone up with Estelle Getty. Speaking about the film in 2006, he called it “maybe one of the worst films in the entire solar system, including alien productions we’ve never seen.”1734 Sarah Jessica Parker – Sex and the City 2Although Sarah Jessica Parker will forever be best known for playing Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City, that does not mean she’s not open to criticising the second film. I can see where we fell short,” she told an audience at Vulture festival. “I understand, I actually get it. I will say, I also understand how much frickin’ money it made. I feel like that is forgotten in the discussion.” Paul Newman had high standards. So much so that, before the release of The Silver Chalice, the Oscar-winning actor took out adverts in the trade press urging people to not watch the television broadcast of the film. He later called it “the worst motion picture produced during the 1950s.Few actors are quite as straight talking as Colin Farrell, who said of the 2006 blockbuster Miami Vice: Miami Vice? I didn\u0027t like it so much. I thought it was style over substance and I accept a good bit of the responsibility.”There are many films Brad Pitt could arguably regret making (the awful 1992 flick Cool World comes to mind), but speaking to Newsweek in 1997, the actor decided to criticise The Devil’s Own. He called the film a disaster and the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking, if you can even call it that, that I\u0027ve ever seen.Following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Jim Carrey distanced himself from the violent Kick Ass sequel. “I did Kick Ass a month before Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,” he wrote on Twitter. “My apologies”.Most people know Zac Efron as Troy Bolton from High School Musical. Zac Efron, though, wishes you knew him for something else. “I step back and look at myself and I still want to kick that guy’s ass sometimes, he told Men\u0027s Fitness. He’s done some kind of cool things with some cool people – he did that one thing that was funny – but, I mean, he’s still just that f***ing kid from High School Musical.2334 Shia LaBeouf – Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal SkullCharlize Theron may be one of the most acclaimed actors working today, but that does not mean she has not worked on bad films. One of those was Reindeer Games, co-starring Ben Affleck. “Reindeer Games. That was a bad, bad, bad movie,” she told Esquire in 2007. “But even though the movie might suck, I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself – that’s why I did it.”The Amazing Spider-Man series, starring Andrew Garfield as the eponymous web-slinger, was supposed to launch a cinematic universe to match the Avengers. There were even rumours of an Aunt May film entering production. Not that the actor who played Aunt May, Sally Field, would have been thrilled by that. “It’s really hard to find a three-dimensional character in it,” she told Howard Stern of playing the character, “and you work it as much as you can, but you can’t put 10 pounds of s**t in a five-pound bag.”Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Adam West – some of Hollywood’s best actors have played the Caped Crusader on screen. However, only one wore a suit with Batnipples: George Clooney. “Let me just say that I’d actually thought I’d destroyed the franchise until somebody else brought it back years later and changed it,” he said of the role. “I thought at the time that this was going to be a very good career move. It wasn’t.”2734 Daniel Radcliffe – Harry Potter and the Half Blood PrinceDirector David Gordon Green, Danny McBride and James Franco struck gold with their stoner-comedy Pineapple Express. Unfortunately, their attempt to make another laugh-out-loud film, Your Highness, was a mess. Your Highness? That movie sucks, Franco told GQ. You can\u0027t get around that.Matt Damon’s original Bourne trilogy won plaudits from critics around the world, with the second instalment featuring on The Independent’s “Films to watch before you die” list. The actor, though, has spoken unkindly about the third film, The Bourne Ultimatum, saying the original script, written by director Tony Gilroy, was awful. It\u0027s really the studio\u0027s fault for putting themselves in that position, Damon told GQ. I don\u0027t blame Tony for taking a boatload of money and handing in what he handed in. It\u0027s just that it was unreadable. This is a career-ender. I mean, I could put this thing up on eBay and it would be game over for that dude. It\u0027s terrible. It\u0027s really embarrassing. He was having a go, basically, and he took his money and left.“It\u0027s the worst film I have ever made,” the former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, said of the fantasy film Red Sonja. “When my kids get out of line, they\u0027re sent to their rooms and forced to watch Red Sonja 10 times. I never had too much trouble with them.3234 Alec Baldwin – Rock of AgesThere are some actors who know they’re making a disaster midway through production. “It was a complete disaster,” Alec Baldwin told The Wrap when asked about Rock of Ages. “A week in you go, ‘Oh God, what have I done?\u0027”Bill Murray only voiced the beloved cat Garfield because of a misunderstanding: he thought Joel Coen, of the Coen brothers fame, had written the script. In fact, Joel Cohen, whose filmography includes Cheaper by the Dozen, Toy Story, and Monster Mash: The Movie, had. I was exhausted, soaked with sweat, and the lines got worse and worse. And I said, \u0027Okay, you better show me the whole rest of the movie, so we can see what we\u0027re dealing with,\u0027 he told GQ. So I sat down and watched the whole thing, and I kept saying, \u0027Who the hell cut this thing? Who did this? What the f*** was Coen thinking?\u0027 And then they explained it to me: it wasn\u0027t written by that Joel Coen.Even for video-game adaptations, Super Mario Bros, released in 1993, was a particularly strange film. Asked by , What is the worst job you\u0027ve done? What has been your biggest disappointment? and If you could edit your past, what would you change? the actor had only one answer: Super Mario Brothers.Viola Davis was nominated for an Oscar for The Help. Yet, the actor deeply regretted playing the maid Aibileen Clark, saying her character’s voice is not heard enough in the final film. Have I ever done roles that I\u0027ve regretted?

And he was kind to me. He was so generous with me.

Analysis of a 74-year-old\u0026nbspA.\u0026nbspsligoi\u0026nbspspecimen that once lived at London Zoo revealed its distinct genetic code and it is this species that is thought to be the largest of the three.Sixteen other specimens collected in the early 20th century were also examined.“It’s amazing in this day and age that it took until now to work out what the world’s largest amphibian is,” the study’s lead author Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at ZSL, told National Geographic.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friendship with the White HouseTrudeau\u0027s gender-balanced cabinet was the first of its kindMr Trudeau, 47, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, and who was first elected premier in 2015, has been on the back foot since the first images emerged this week. They\u0026nbspshowed him with his face in dark make-up at a party at a school where he was teaching in 2001, aged\u0026nbsp29.The school yearbook picture, obtained by Time\u0026nbspmagazine, show him wearing a turban for an Arabian Nights-themed fancy dress party at the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver.\u0026nbspThe prime minister, who launched his re-election campaign just a week ago, said he should have known better. “I’m pissed off at myself, I’m disappointed in myself,” Mr Trudeau told reporters.But on Thursday, the problem appeared to get worse for Mr Trudeau,\u0026nbspas other images of him in blackface emerged. Asked how many incidents there may have been, he replied: “I’m wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.”He said he had already shared “the moments I recollected”, adding:\u0026nbsp“But I recognise that it is something absolutely unacceptable to do. And I appreciate calling it makeup, but it was blackface, and that is just not right.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Earlier this year, Virginia governor\u0026nbspRalph Northam faced repeated calls to stand down after a racist picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook. He did not do so.The episode is deeply embarrassing for Mr Trudeau and disappointing for his supporters.

The page, which encouraged people to “see them aliens” and suggested that enough people raid the base then they couldn’t be stopped, is bringing an unknown number of people to Nevada to take part in the event.Local officials have already signed emergency declarations in response to the event, and local residents warned people not to come. But the event is still likely to prove popular, leading people to take precautions against whatever might happen.“We are preparing for the worst,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who could see from his home a makeshift stage and cluster of portable toilets in a dusty area recently scraped of brush surrounding West’s little motel and cafe.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

He’s also organised a radio-equipped night watch of neighbours, fearing there won’t be enough water, food, trash bins or toilets for visitors.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night.

Promoters began scouting sites. A beer company produced alien-themed cans. A Nevada brothel offered discounts to “E.T. enthusiasts.”The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby air space this week.The U.S. Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to approach the gates of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.Area 51 tested aircraft ranging from the U-2 in the 1950s to the B-2 stealth bomber in the 1980s. The government spent decades refusing to acknowledge the site even existed, before releasing documents confirming it in 2013. Its secrecy still fuels speculation that it’s where the government studies aliens.County lawmakers in Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, are discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials there.“We’re taking precautions and checking the back roads,” Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said.Her deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by “Storm Area 51.” The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and promised to pay thousands in fines.Arnu said the military added razor wire to barbed cattle fencing on the Area 51 boundary near his home, installed more cameras and battery-powered lighting, and erected an imposing spike barrier just inside a gate.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for. I can’t even get aroused when Fiona Bruce comes on telly.”And Jenner Saunders  No. Silly question.Kane Robinson and Ashley Walters’ mesmerising performances as Sully and Dushane, on Netflix’s Top Boy.Mark Wright’s genuinely fascinating Who Do You Think You Are  drawing a direct line between Towie and the Spanish inquisition.GMB’s hungover host Piers Morgan making such a perfect Brexit idiot of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, on my favourite show, she did the left-wing equivalent of pressing the ejector seat button and yelped: “Food banks.”S Club ’s Paul Cattermole appearing at the First Dates Hotel, looking uncannily like Charlie Higson.And Goggleboxer Pete giving brilliant context to the claim the singer had been, “Beaten around by the industry”, by pointing out: “For £. an hour I had my arm shoulder deep in s***. And HE’S been ‘beaten around by the industry ’”Gemma Collins, Arg and all those other Z-list celebrities who think turning up late for everything is a charming personality quirk.Planner-knackering programmes that last exactly one hour . . . and five minutes.An advert for Britain’s smuggest and touchiest television network, Channel , maintaining, “complaints welcome”.First Dates maitre d’ Fred Sirieix being a little bit more in love with fame than is healthy.And Odd One Out, with Jesy Nelson of Little Mix, which really wasn’t the replacement for the Paul Daniels’ masterpiece I was hoping for or expecting.Well, fairly sure.DAVE, Wednesday, pm: Comedians Giving Lectures.THIS week’s winner is football pundit Danny Murphy and That Yellow B*stard from Sin City.Sent in by Dean Edmunds.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer. So do their parents. So do others who still don’t even know whether their kids were abused because she refuses to say.This evil paedophile should not have been freed, even after ten years.

Her owner is known to police, but has gone on the run.There was no chip on the Panther, or registration documents associated with her, suggesting she was a black market animal who had been trafficked into France illegally, said the source.Detectives said they found an oversized dog basket and food which was clearly set out for the Panther in a nearby house.The Panther was today at the Protestant League of Lilleshelter in the city, where she spent the night in a blacked out cage aimed at reducing stress.Shes quite young, said an LPA spokesman. She’s like Labrador.The spokesman said there were signs that the animal’s claws had been illegally cut down, to avoid her hurting anyone.She would have dficulty feeding and climbing trees because of this, said the spokesman, adding: But she was otherwise healthy, with a good coat.The LPA has now contacted the zoo in nearby Maubeuge, in the hope that she can find a new home there.One local policeman told the Voix du Nord newspaper: In twenty years of working, I have never seen anything like it. A snake, yes. But not a big cat like that.A Black Panther is not a species, but a reference to the colour of types of leopards or jaguars.The blackness is caused by the agouti gene, which regulates the distribution of black pigment within the hair shaft.The gene is most common in leopards from Africa and Asia and in jaguars from South America.Those who appear in countries such as France and Britain are iniably zoo escapees or released pets that had been held illegally, possibly because they became too dficult to manage."},{"url":null,"title":"freshers week 2019 students cowboy night out","story":"No doubt some will be nursing a sore head today as not only did they hit the city’s night spots but a few also hit the floor.Many of the first year students got into the swing of the wild west-themed party and wore Stetson hats and carried toy pistols.The move by the students is rather controversial after the University of Kent in Canterbury student’s union banned cowboy fancy dress outfits last year, saying the costumes could be seen as “offensive”.In a statement in October  it claimed: dressing up as a particular race, culture or stereotype is offensive.But by the looks of things the new students in Bradford didn’t have any problems dressing up as they had a wild time before settling down to their studies.A few though looked like they had trouble staying on their feet as some party-goers were seen sprawled out in the road or even just having a quick sit down before continuing the festivities.First year students up and down the country have been enjoying the party atmosphere of Freshers’ Week.In Portsmouth earlier this week many students donned some seriously revealing outfits to take part in the Big Night Out pub crawl.Students in Birmingham and Manchester were spotted out and about having a ball as they made new friends ahead of their first term."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery lost boy orlando sleeping porch burned out car","story":"Three-year-old Noelvin, from near Orlando, Florida, told a concerned woman his familys car was on fire, police said.Police then found a charred vehicle in a wooded area nearby later that night with evidence of human remains inside.But they will take a while to identy the incinerated bodies it is too early to saythe cases are related.Meanwhile Noelvin’s parents plus a family friend remain missing.  Buffalo Police Department Captain Jeff Rinaldo said: The child is in good spirits.He is currently in the custody of Child Protective Services and we are working with CPS and the grandmothers, to begin the process of reuniting them.After making contact with the childs grandparents, police said he may have been on a drive with his parents Nicole Merced Plaud, , and Miguel Valentin-Colon, .A -year-old family friend Dhamyl Roman-Audfred may have also been in the car. The young boys family said they didnt know his parents were planning to go anywhere.Noelvin’s grandfather Jorge Oquendo told ABC affiliate WFTV:  Were heartbroken, were worried, were scared.Were all devastated. ...

Many will not be able to begin an apprenticeship, start technical courses or enter some workplaces because they cannot meet the basic entry requirements.The analysis also concludes that children on free school meals- a key measure of poverty - are twice as likely as their richer classmates to be without this level of qualications at age .In total, %of FSM teenagers did not get to this level of attainment, compared to % of their wealthier peers.It is shameful that last year almost , children in England left education at  without proper qualications, Ms Longfield said.It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment.While we should celebrate the progress that is being made in raising standards for millions of children, it should never be an acceptable part of the education system for thousands of children to leave with next to nothing.She called on the Government to investigate the issue and commit to halving the numbers failing to get Level  qualications by age  within the next five years.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, said: It is shocking that the number of children leaving education without a qualication has risen by nearly a quarter in the last three years.It is clear that this sudden rise has happened since the Tories came to power and imposed brutal cuts on education and support for families and children.The figures are particularly stark for children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and with special educational needs and disabilities, yet more evidence that those who most need our support are those losing out.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: The number of children leaving school without basic qualications fell continuously between  and , but has risen sharply in recent years as the full impact of real-terms cuts to school funding has become clear.Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are the victims of a decade of austerity.

in a talent show.This picture is understood to have also been taken in the s.In the first image that came to light, Trudeau can be seen sporting a turban and robes at the Arabian Nights themed party at the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver.That photo was taken in  when Trudeau was a -year-old teacher at the private school, according to Time magazine.Trudeau confirmed he was dressed as a character from Aladdin and said he had his arm around a close friend.I should have known better then, but I didnt and I did it and Im deeply sorry, Trudeau told reporters on his campaign plane in Nova Scotia.Im p***ed off at myself, Im disappointed in myself.”I take responsibility for my decision to do that... it was something that I didnt think was racist at the time but now I recognise it was something racist to do.He later added: It was dumb.With Election Day just a month away in his bid for another term, the -year-old begged forgiveness from the people of Canada.Darkening your face regardless of the context or the circumstances is always unacceptable because of the racist history of blackface, he said.I should have understood that then, and I never should have done it.I have always acknowledged I came from a place of privilege, but I now need to acknowledge that comes with a massive blind spot, the son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said.He then added: “I am wary of, of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.”Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who is mounting a serious challenge to the prime minister in the October  vote, reacted by declaring Trudeau not fit to govern this country.The prime minister, though, gave no sign at all that he might resign, and there were no immediate calls from any leading figures in his Liberal Party to step down.Maxime Bernier, the leader of the Peoples Party of Canada, slammed Trudeau as the “biggest hypocrite in the country”.“I’m not going to accuse Justin Trudeau of being a racist,” he said.“But he’s the master of identity politics and the Libs just spent months accusing everyone of being white supremacists.”Trudeau has in the past accused people who have questioned Canadas immigration policies as being racist.Elizabeth May, the leader of Canadas Green Party, tweeted: I am deeply shocked by the racism shown in the photograph of Justin Trudeau.He must apologise for the harm done and commit to learning and appreciating the requirement to model social justice leadership at all levels of government.In this matter he has failed.New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh, who is sikh and wears a turban, sent a message of support to anyone who has ever been bullied over their race.The first photo appeared in the school’s - yearbook, The View.Vancouver businessman, Michael Adamson, a member of the school community, shared the photo after feeling it should be made public.The blackface scandal could undermine Trudeaus chances for re-election with less than five weeks to go before the national election.The photo could prove to be particularly politically embarrassing because Trudeau has been admired by liberals worldwide for his progressive policies.The Liberal Party leader gained a record  seats in , emerging as a darling of progressives around the world.But his purchase of a controversial oil pipeline and an embarrassing trip to India have sent his popularity plummeting.Trudeau was especially vulnerable following one of the biggest scandals in Canadian political history.This arose when Trudeaus former attorney general said he improperly pressured her to halt the criminal prosecution of a company in Quebec.Trudeau argued he was standing up for jobs, but he has struggled to deflect criticism."},{"url":null,"title":"unelected judges blocking brexit constitutional vandalism","story":"It is a stunt by rich Remainers whose only concern for democracy is that it must always deliver what they want.Failing that, their money, fancy QCs and our courts must do so instead.This weekend our top judges will ponder whether Boris Johnson suspended Parliament unlawfully, not to set up a new programme for Government but to avoid scrutiny of his Brexit strategy.But courts should have no veto over political decisions.

I think the dficulty has just been that, Michael was a very, very close member of the team.“He was so central to my thinking on education reform and other things, and so watching what happened next was very painful and I did in some ways thought hed become quite a dferent person in all of it. But as I say, le goes on.”Yesterday Mr Cameron had hit out atover its editorial which discussed his “privileged pain” over the death of his six-year-old son.Speaking on LBC, he said:  “There is no privilege in holding your eldest born child in your arms as their le drains away.Death knows no privilege... from the little I saw of it [the editorial] I couldnt understand what it was trying to say."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland savages brexit deal hope","story":"NewsIreland savages Brexit deal hope with collateral damage blast at Boris JohnsonSimon Coveney, Irelands Deputy PM, warned of \"civil unrest\" as he punctured the Prime Ministers hope of reaching a dealShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video ireland-shoots-down-brexit-deal-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Yet Mr Coveney today fumed that people should not be taken in by the current talks - which he said would only kick the can down the road to a later date. Warning Ireland could become collateral damage, he blasted Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclayaposs claim that a fully-formed alternative to the backstop will only be needed in .    Mr Coveney told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: What weaposre being asked to do by Stephen Barclay and others is to replace a guarantee around that border question which solves it... with a promise that somehow we will do our best to try to solve this issue in the future but we donapost know how just yet. That doesnapost sound like a fair deal to me. The Irish position is that we want to find a solution, we want to get a deal and we want to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly and sensible manner. But we cannot allow Ireland to be the collateral damage of that. And I think for Britain to ask us to do that is a very unreasonable request. And it wonapost be the basis for a deal. He added: Trade across  road crossings that has created a normality and a peace that is settled on the island of Ireland for the last  years, that now faces signicant disruption... That is what weaposre fighting for here. Ireland is in no doubt as to what a no deal means for us. It is very damaging, very dficult and it poses huge questions for politics and potentially for the management of civic unrest in the context of Northern Ireland, around the border question.    The backstop is a clause in the -page Withdrawal Agreement that guarantees Northern Ireland would not have to make border checks along the frontier with the Republic. But in , the UK would be forced to follow EU rules once the backstop kicked in - on  January  - and there would be no end date. EU chiefs have shted their language in recent days by saying they are happy to consider an alternative to the backstop, as long as it achieves the same objectives. Mr Coveney said he had “no problem with” an alternative to the backstop and “we are not attached to the backstop because of its name”. But he warned a big gap remains between the UK and the bloc adding: In order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government which we simply havenapost received yet.  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet with the EUaposs chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels today after hopes of a deal mounted. Speaking to Sky News, Jean-Claude Juncker said we can have a deal and the pound reached a two-month high. But he was unable to put the chances at more than   when pressed. And the UK is embroiled in a row after EU leaders said there must be concrete written proposals to solve the border question by the end of this month.

The State Opening of Parliament - at which you will hear the Queenaposs Speech. Itaposs the regular, though not always annual, ceremony that kicks off the Parliamentary schedule. We havenapost had one in a while - the last one was in . And the last one was lacking some of the pomp and ceremony of previous events. Hereaposs what you can expect from the Queenaposs speech and the State Opening Of Parliament - and when they will take place. What is the Queenaposs speech   The Queen makes her speech at the State Opening of Parliament which is the formal start to the parliamentary session. The Queen makes a speech setting out what we can expect from her Government in a speech which is written for her by the Prime Minister and his team. When is the next Queenaposs Speech If Boris Johnson gets his way, it will be on October . The State Opening is usually one of the major events of the Parliamentary calendar. Or it used to be. It seems like more or less every day in Westminster is a major, earth-changing event these days. But what usually happens at the State Opening is this: The Queen arrives at the Houses of Parliament, through the Sovereign Entrance. She then puts on the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, and leads a procession through the Royal Gallery into the chamber of the House of Lords. The members of the House of Commons then join the Lords in their chamber - but not until a House of Lords official, known as Black Rod is sent to summon them. Itaposs ceremony that the Commons slam the door in his face, to signy the separation of the Commons from the Lords. He then bangs on the door three times, they open it and follow him through. Then, the actual speech itself is delivered from the throne in the House of Lords. Although the Queen speaks it, being the Queens Speech, it is actually written by the Government. Then, the Queen leaves, a new parliamentary session starts and everyone gets back to work.  Nope. Last time round the State Opening was triggered by Theresa Mayaposs snap election in . The State Opening, with all its pomp and ceremony, takes months to plan. And in  it was eventually scheduled for just a few days after the trooping of the colour.

Because there is no cure for Pompe the family from Bodmin in Cornwall face a letime of two-weekly trips to a specialist in Birmingham, where Archie will receive essential treatment to manage his illness. His family says that because of the illness, Archieaposs body stores glycogen because he is missing the enzyme that enables it to be broken down. The build up of glycogen then damages the bodies organs, nerve cells and muscles which means he doesnapost have the strength that he should have.The severity of the disease ies between iniduals, but it is said to be particularly lethal in infants and young children, Cornwall Live reports.Speaking of how they reached the diagnosis, Archieaposs dad, Jack, said: Earlier on he had a lot of feeding dficulties. He just wasnapost gaining weight and as he got older he wasnapost meeting his milestones like sitting up or rolling. It basically stores his glycogen in his muscles and his body canapost break this down because he is missing the enzyme. Because he is missing this enzyme his muscles arenapost working as well as they should be.    Jack said that they had an idea that something wasnapost quite right with Archie early on, and that his partner, Tamika, who has two children from a previous relationship, was particularly anxious about his symptoms. Jack, who has had to take time off from training to be a hairdresser, said: My partner struggled because she knew that something wasnapost right and doctors didnapost think it was anything to begin with. Doctors and midwes were saying they didnapost think it was anything to worry about. People werenapost really concerned which was horrible for us and for her, but once the tests have been done everything has been amazing. The problem is, doctors down here arenapost very familiar with Pompe disease and what it is, because it is very rare. But we saw one doctor who conducted micro-screening and thought it could be one of a few things and the diagnosis came back as Pompe disease.    Tamika and Jack, who live in Bodmin with their three children say there is no telling what the future holds for Archie, who hasnapost been able to start his treatment yet as his veins are not strong enough for the tansfusion. Jake said: He’s due to have an operation to have a port put in so that he can have an infusion every two weeks, which he will have for le. We donapost know as of yet whether he will lead a normal le as it depends on how his body reacts to that treatment. It should help his heart definitely and anything  doesnapost matter. If itaposs not picked up and a child has no treatment or the treatment doesnapost work it can be le threatening. He added: He could be in a wheelchair, he could be bed bound or he could be up and running about. He is a very determined little child and is a very happy and content baby.

The Camelot theme park in Lancashire was based on the well-known medieval Camelot castle, which was associated with the legendary King Arthur, and comprised of a acre site near the village of Charnock Richard. Thousands of families would visit the park each year, before its gates finally closed in . Since then, the park has been left to crumble away - now laying in tatters, with rusting rollercoasters and a crumbling white castle at the entrance.Owners Knights Leisure blamed low visitor numbers on bad weather and events such as the  Olympics and The Queen’s Jubilee - with over  staff losing their jobs.  Whilst certain rollercoasters were sold to theme parks around Europe, seven years later, many of the rides remain abandoned, reports the Liverpool Echo .‘Urban explorers’, while warned off the site, are regularly found walking the tracks of the decaying rollercoasters, avoiding the   security that roam the perimeter. Previously, almost  new homes are planned for the former Camelot site by developer Story Homes. The plans are for up to  homes and an employment area, which Story Homes says could deliver about  jobs.    The proposals have proved controversial with residents in the area. The Camelot theme park opened in  and boasted a ft roller coaster called the Knitemare which spanned some  meters. It also had a log flume, a smaller size roller coaster The Twister, three large water slides and a large caterpillar roller coaster train which spanned the wholeand depth of the park running above ground and on ground level. Together Money set about calculating the hypothetical land value of eight intriguing abandoned places from around the globe, from derelict theme parks to uninhabited islands.

It was the picture perfect moment as his proud daughter eagerly ran towards the classroom with her hair neatly plaited and her socks pulled up high. But tragically it was a bittersweet moment, because Laylaaposs mum Cheryl Hardy wasnapost there, after she died suddenly at their home in January . Ahead of the big day, devoted dad Fakir, known as aposZackapos, turned to YouTube so he could learn how to plait Layla’s hair to make sure everything was just right for her. Now Fakir, known as aposZackapos speaks for the first time to Mirror about how he is raising the five children they had together alone - with a little extra bit of help from YouTube. And he describes the heartbreaking moment that Layla asked him: aposWhen can mummy take me to school apos Another time, she worriedly asked: “You won’t leave us too, will you ”  Unable to answer the dficult questions, the grieving dad has instead tried to fill both roles of mother and father as best he can. Zack, , said: “Layla missed her presence every day. “But these are questions I cannot answer at the moment. “This might sound strange to some people, but I’ve not told any of my kids that their mum is not coming back. “I’ve never said it. At the moment, I don’t think the time is right given how young they are. “I don’t want them to get distracted and I’m waiting for the right time. “The time will come. Every time they mention mum, I just say she’s in a better place. “I don’t want them to get upset.”  The family had their hearts ripped out in January  as Cheryl, , passed away just seven weeks after giving birth to a baby boy. And as the last person to see her alive, Zack says he wishes he’d stayed with her after he woke up early and went downstairs. But he praises the support network of family, friends and neighbours who have helped anchor the family in their grief. Now he remains upbeat as he talks about how his family are continuing to thrive as they adapt to their new circumstances. Mum Cheryl, , was discovered unconscious by oldest daughter Rhiannah who immediately alerted Zack. But despite medics best efforts, she was declared dead  minutes after they arrived.  The circumstances were especially tragic as the mum, who hoped to become a midwe, had just given birth seven weeks earlier to a baby boy. And after Cheryl died, Zack pledged to raise the children they had together - Rhiannah, , Amirah, , Kameel, nine, Kesaar Mulla, seven, and Layla Mulla, five, - as a single dad. He said: “The biggest challenges are getting them what they need, rather than what they want. “And they go to three dferent schools so it’s all about handling that.” Before her death, Cheryl, who was training to be a midwe, had not been in good health following a trip to Disneyland Paris in December. And she had previously suffered a pulmonary embolism, which is when a clump of material like a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in the lungs.  But devastated Zack says the death “came out of the blue” and was completely unexpected. He said: “I couldn’t speak to anyone for about two weeks after it happened. “I refused to eat, speak to anyone properly, I just wanted to turn my phone off and disappear for about two or three weeks. “I was a mess. But at the same time, I knew I couldn’t give in because of the kids. “I knew that they only had me and I had to make sure I had a brave face on. “I was married to her for ten years, it’s dficult, I’m still brokenhearted.  He added: In the first few days after Cheryl died, I cried a lot. That upset my kids. They would beg me, apossmile, Daddy, smileapos. So I decided to try to hide my sadness. But my kids seemed to know that I was really sad and on the verge of tears. I told them that even though they couldnapost make my sadness go away, they could do something important by comforting me with all their hugs. I think their hugs have helped them as much as they have helped me. Now Zack says he is determined to make his we proud and keep her memory alive. He said: “We look through memory books with all the photos of our trip to Disneyland Paris. “They go through that a lot, which is good.”  And he says he sends her messages of gratitude constantly. He said: “I thank her, I thank her all the time. I’ll always pay tribute to her and mention her on social media. “I wouldn’t be here without her, she blessed me with the children. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re her kids and I’m doing everything in my le for her to make sure they’re looked after and loved all the time. “She’ll never be forgotten ever. I’ll mention her everyday around the house.” But the grieving dad admits he feels guilt over her death - even though it was due to medical issues. And he wakes up every day at half five, as that was the last time he spoke to her. He said: “I apologise to her when I wake up in the morning and I apologise to her when I go to bed. “I blame myself, I think it was my fault that I spoke to her at half past five in the morning and I didn’t stay in bed when I should have done. “Two hours later, she was found like that.”  Now Zack says he is not interested in another relationship as he focuses his attention on raising his children. Ahead of Layla joining Year One at primary school, Zack watched tutorials on the social media channel before practicing on his daughter’s doll. He said: “She’s been asking me for a while but I told her I couldn’t do it. “I can just about put two bobbles around her hair. “But I watched a few YouTube tutorials and tried it on a dolly. “It’s not a fantastic job but I’m doing what I can do. She was pleased.” Zack says Cherylaposs unexpected death sent shockwaves across the community as she was a keen volunteer.

The research suggests many of ushave had an awkward encounter where weaposve bumped into someone who apologised, and an unfortunate  per cent of us have bumped into someone looking at a phone who didnapost apologise. And now it seems weaposve slipped so far into the technology-obsessed abyss that the UKaposs first aposslow lanesapos for people looking at their phones while walking have opened in Manchester.    The two adjacent -metre long‘mobile phone safe lanes’ have been installed in the Spinningfields district of Manchester city centre. It is now hoped the designated pathway for pedestrians will help stop people who walk with their eyes glued to their mobile phones from bumping into each other. The pavement along Hardman Bouled – a busy pedestrian thoroughfare surrounded by offices, shops, bars and restaurants, used by tens of thousands of people every week – now has arrows and signs that mark out separate walking lanes on the pavement exclusively for slow-walking smartphone users. So you can stroll down them safe in the knowledge you wonapost bump into anyone - and those able to pull themselves away from their technology can be reassured they wonapost bump into you.

Samantha Last, , revealed the heartbreaking news in a clip on her YouTube beauty blog - describing how she had been feeling ill for a number of weeks.Last Tuesday, the mum-of-four said she woke in the early hours of the morning with a severe migraine.Just hours later, she was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumour before being told to go home and spend as much time with her family. Samantha, who also has seven grandchildren, created her aposfinal farewellapos video for fans - bravely telling them through tears about her cancer diagnosis. Sat alongside her husband of  years, David, Samantha said: I am so, so sorry itaposs a horrible message I am sharing. If anyone sees me out I am not my usual glamorous self. I am never going to be my usual glamorous self.    All that matters is to be comfortable and to be with my loved ones and you. This is going to be my last YouTube video...I want you to be involved in this one last journey with me. This is my final farewell.Samantha goes on to describe how she plans to spend her final days doing one of her favourite things - visiting the beach with family, reports the Sun.She explained how she, her husband and children -  Danny, , Jasmine, , Ebony, , and Brandon,  - plan on hiring a camper van and visiting some of her favourite spots. The family have set up a fundraiser to help with their special trip.   One their GoFundMe page , her husband writes: At only  years old, Samantha woke up on Tuesday morning with a splitting headache, following paracetamol, the headache didn’t go, so she tried a Beechams Hot Lemon, that still didn’t work and the pain was increasing.We went straight to Accident and Emergency Hospital and following checks, Samantha had a CT Scan, that revealed an Aggressive Brain Tumour and was taken to the Neuroscience ward. The next day, Samantha had a MRI scan, so the hospital could create a plan of treatment. On Thursday the data was sent to Addenbrookes, which is a head specialist hospital for them to analyse the images. On Friday, the doctors came round to tell Samantha the brain tumour was terminal and could not be treated, so she could go home to spend her final days or weeks with her family.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome landmines in Angola shoot from the earth to chest height, spraying metal fragments that leave the vital organs in ribbons. Others set off a blast that forces dirt, stones, plastic and metal into the lower limbs, ripping apart bone and muscle. Many are picked up by mistake, mostly by children who think they’ve found toys. Minga was five when she spied a shiny object she thought might be a tin of tuna by the side of a road, and excitedly tapped it against a rock to remove the dirt so she could make her family’s day by bringing home dinner. She realised it wasn’t tuna but wasn’t sure what it was, so began to play with it. It exploded, robbing her of her sight and her right arm from below the elbow. Ten years later, all she remembers is a flash followed by silence.    Sapalo was  when a huge dung beetle fell out of a rubbish bag he was moving from his parents’ kitchen. On the table was a piece of metal his uncle had brought in the previous night. He used it to brush the beetle out of the house. It was a grenade, which exploded, taking both his legs and one eye. They’re just two of more than , ­Angolans maimed by the legacy of the -year civil war that left a million mines in the fields, villages and roads of one of the poorest countries on earth.Prince Harry will be there next week to honour the memory of his mother, who walked through an Angolan minefield months before her death in  to bring the cause to the world’s attention.Shortly after she died the Ottawa Treaty, outlawing the use and production of landmines, was signed by  nations. The issue has fallen down the global agenda, which is why Harry is there to push it back up, as part of the goal to make the world landmine-free by .    In Angola, with at least , areas still affected and international and national funding being decimated, that deadline looks beyond ambitious. Seeing the problem ­first-hand is beyond tragic... Seventeen years after the civil war ended there are more than  dferent types of mines, supplied by  nations, still active in the huge West African country. As well as taking lives and wrecking bodies, houses can’t be built, fields can’t be cultivated and villages can’t grow. It’s the closeness of ordinary le to such appalling twists of fate that shocks most. Women walk up to six miles to the nearest river to fetch water, often through areas they know are mined. Men cultivate contaminated fields, even when the de-miners are working in them, in the knowledge that any second a hoe could hit something that takes their limbs.    They have no choice. No water and no food equals no le. Every hour of the day is a deadly risk-assessment. Even for kids at play. The Manchester-based Mines ­Advisory Group, which in the past decade has cleared nine million square feet of Angolan minefields, is doing its best to rid the country of an evil weapon that shames the human race. Their teams cleared Lucusse village of mines but all around lie weapon parts. Kids clamber on to blown-up tanks that still have live rocket shells in them. As I watch, two men tell MAG workers they’ve found shells inside another tank. The previous day a boy chased a rat under a tank and found three explosives. In another part of the village boys play football using parts of tanks as ­goalposts.    Twenty yards away, in May, Emilia, nine, and Jamba, two, lit a grass fire. Underneath lay a live grenade. They died instantly. It’s scary going into minefields. I joined the de-miners at Luathamba, where  explosives,  of them huge anti-tank mines, were found in one field. Just putting on the body armour and protective visor gives you the chilling realisation that one mis-reading of the colour-coded sticks that indicate where mines have been cleared, could blow you apart. And I’m colour-blind. And two hours from the nearest hospital. In the village, MAG’s community team is giving the kids a mine awareness class. They’re shown dferent explosives and how to reactthey see any.    Two boys say that they’ve seen rockets in a field, then lead the team to the spot. Under a tree lies the deadly weapons. The de-miners bury them, wire them to a detonator, walk  yards away and let me press the button that produces a deafening bang and a plume of smoke seen for miles. It was a weird Dr ­Strangelove moment. There were  nations involved in the Angolan civil war, a proxy war between Communism and the West. Man is very good at starting bloodbaths but not too good at cleaning up the devastation they wreak. Due to international aid falling by % and Angolan public spending being slashed because of a collapse in the price of oil, it’s more important than ever for nations and inidual donors to step up. Only three of its  provinces are mine-free and there is an estimated  million square metres to clear.    MAG reckons £million is needed to stand a chance of making that  deadline in a country where it’s claimed one-in- of its  million people has stepped on a mine.

Temperatures will be eight degrees above average in some parts of the country on Saturday. The unseasonably hot conditions will come to an end on Sunday as downpours spread across Britain. Hurricane Humberto is currently on its way to the UK with forecasters expecting the remnants of the storm to make landfall on Monday, bringing strong winds and heavy rain.   Emma Smith, a Met Office meteorologist, said: As we go into tomorrow afternoon and evening, the temperature is starting to get a bit warmer.We are looking to Cto Cas we go into tomorrow and the same into Saturday. In eastern areas, we are likely to see Cas a maximum temperature - this time of year we should have a maximum of Cor Cin London.    Although it will be toasty, as the high pressure begins to move east the wind will pick up in western parts of the British Isles and could reach speeds of mph in parts of Wales, western Scotland and the Northern Irish coast.The warm weather will not stick around for long as the tail end of Hurricane Humberto blows towards the UK from the Bahamas, bringing wind and rain from Monday - the first day of autumn.Ms Smith said: On Sunday, the temperature will start to turn downwards - we could still see a high of Cbut that will be quite isolated in the east of England. From there on in, we do get unsettled weather day by day with temperatures falling down to where they should be for this time of year.

The first museum of its kind will open in Camden Market, London, on November  following a successful £, crowdfunding campaign. Its founders say the goal is to create an educational shrine to vaginas, vulvas and the broader gynaecological anatomy. Disco parties, comedy nights, school tours and art exhibitions may be unusual ways to help break the stigma associated with female genitals. But the founders hope that offering a fascinating museum featuring everything science and history to vulva cupcakes and aposvagacchinoapos coffees will make visitors feel more comfortable with the important topic.    Founder Florence Schecter decided to set up a museum dedicated to vaginas after learning in  about the existence of one dedicated to penises in Iceland. After discovering Icelandaposs Phallological Museum, which displays hundreds of penises from animals, Ms Schechter felt it was only fairthere was a physical building that spotlighted female genitals as well. Through workshops, talks and social events, she said she wanted to create a space that would bring people together - young and old - to address sensitive issues like female genital mutilation, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual health. Itaposs really important because itaposs a hugely stigmatised part of the body and that leads to some real world consequences, she said. Just anything and everything thataposs taboo with that part of the body is what weaposre going to be addressing.  She said some girls and women feel awkward about getting gynaecological check-ups, such as screenings for cervical cancer, or discussing their periods. About one in four women in Britain do not attend a cervical screening, according a January survey by charity Joaposs Cervical Cancer Trust, with nearly three-quarters of women saying they missed the test due to embarrassment. Menstruation is still taboo in many countries. In Nepal, women are banished from their homes during their periods - a centuries-old practice that is now illegal - and several have died of smoke inhalation after lighting fires to keep warm. Ms Schecter said the museum will also run child-friendly programmes and will offer an outreach programme to ensure children feel comfortable talking about female genitals from an early age. When theyaposre ashamed of their bodies, it becomes really dficult for them to talk about things, she said. Itaposs about de-stigmatising this part of the body and being honest about what it does.

Our minder, one of thousands of electricity company staff working on the mammoth clean-up, warns us staying longer than five minutes is hazardous. We are here to witness the devastation left behind by a catastrophe which has ruined so many lives. The damage is evident eight years on - with mangled roofs and twisted metal, and steel cladding covering gaping holes in the wall of a reactor building. Our visit also coincides with a Japanese court ruling the three men in charge at the time of the  meltdown were not guilty of professional negligence.    Yesterdayaposs judgment that Tokyo Electric Power Company executives Tsunehisa Katsumata, , Sakae Muto, , and Ichiro Takekuro, , could not be held directly responsible for the deaths of more than  hospital patients, among , people evacuated from around the plant, has caused outrage. Lawyer Hiroyuki Kawai, representing more than , locals who filed the criminal complaint against TEPCO, insists the legal battle for justice will continue for years to come. Our ultimate goal is to eradicate dangerous nuclear plants that have thrown many residents into despair, he says, vowing to launch an appeal.  Many of those affected claim the disaster, triggered by a . magnitude earthquake and tsunami, could have been avoided. Prosecutors claimed the executives had access to studies predicting the risk of a nuclear calamity from a tsunami. And in  a special commission concluded Fukushima was a profoundly man-made disaster.  It found TEPCO failed to meet basic safety requirements. The firm deliberately took away clfs which would have protected reactors from a tsunami and also disregarded warnings its sea wall was not high enough. Eight years on, the damage is still evident in the mangled roofs of the Fukushima Daiichi power station reactors and in the ghost towns inside the exclusion zone to which refugees are only now ing.  Entering the prohibited site through a series of police checkpoints, we pass enormous silos where tens of thousands of sealed sacks of radioactive soil are being stored. In the decontamination squad mess building, we see hundreds of workers putting on hazmat suits and breathing masks which are sterilised at the end of the sht. They cannot take anything from the high-radioactivity zone off site.  We are issued with protective masks, goggles, gloves, boots and hard-hats to wear in the most toxic areas. Jagged gaping holes in the shredded wall of a reactor building are reinforced by steel cladding - the only barrier between us and a pool of hazardously radioactive melted fuel. The pipe network of the cooling system which failed when it was pummelled by the -metre high surge of seawater is now a rusted tangle in a derelict shell.  When the earthquake happened, our TEPCO host explains, the three reactors automatically shut down. Emergency diesel generators pumped coolant the through their cores, but when the tsunami struck  minutes later it engulfed the protective seawall flooded the basement. The generators were knocked out and coolant stopped flowing, causing fuel meltdowns.  As workers struggled to re-supply power to the reactorsapos cooling systems over the following days, an intense build-up of hydrogen caused explosions in four of the total six reactors. From a viewing  we can how the steel skeleton of one of the reactors has been left exposed by the blasts. A line on the side of another reactor marks the height of the tsunami.  Robots are being used to remove radioactive debris and spent nuclear fuel from the reactors, we are told. The scale of the clean-up process is most graphically illustrated by the endless rows of -metre high cylinders used to store nearly one million cubic metres of contaminated water. Although a stf sea breeze drts in behind us, our guide snappily tells us it is time to move on.    I can feel a dull ache at the back of my throat, symptomatic of increased background radiation. Another reading is taken before we leave - signicantly higher than it was on arrival. Japanaposs government wants to banish the stigma around Fukushima and the region will next year host several Olympic events.  It will be , however, before TEPCO will be able to declare the site completely safe. Spokesman Katsuyoshi Oyama tells me: Obviously we are not proud, but it is right that we do this properly for the people of Fukushima. To revitalise the area TEPCO must do everything correctly we will stick with this until it is complete.  As Britain increases its dependence on nuclear power from a quarter to a third in the next  years, the lessons of Fukushima are there to be heeded. Although the UK is not prone to earthquakes like Japan, campaigners say there is a danger from flooding. Reactors typically need to be situated near water to keep the reactors cool. Over-budget Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast is the first nuclear plant to be built in Britain since , one of several planned for the coming decades.

If we want to win a league we have to perform as we did in the second half but for  minutes.“We know it’s going to be a hard league. We’re sitting at the top of it. If we’d lost the first game of the season and won our next four the atmosphere would be dferent and the questions would be dferent.“We hope to stay at the top. We’ve had a wee dip but, over the course of a season, there will be more dips like this. We have to make sure we beat Arbroath on Saturday.”Going back to his former stomping ground on the Ayrshire coast, Smith knew he and another ex-Ayr man Lawrence Shankland were going to be under the spotlight wearing tangerine.He accepts they didn’t perform and makes no excuses for himself or anyone  at the Terrors, who know all about the threat and quality of The Honest Men.United lost both of their visits there last season when Smith and Shankland were among the Somerset tormentors-in-chief.Smith added: “From first-hand experience I know Ayr’s philosophy going into every game, particularly playing against Dundee United, who they did well against last season.“They would have been keen to keep that going. Me, Shanks and the other boys knew that they have a squad of good players.“Fair play to them but we didn’t do enough. We didn’t compete and put our stamp on the game. We didn’t deserve to take anything.”Right-back Smith accepts they can’t expect to win every game this season but believes it was the performance which angered those connected with United most.Ayr controlled proceedings for most of the  minutes and Smith believes they can only look at themselves as they seek to get back to winning ways in their quest for promotion.“You can’t win every game but the manner in which we lost was not acceptable,” he said.“We didn’t turn up and Ayr took advantage. They are a good side and we can’t afford to take our foot off the gas at any point.“The second half was better.

Alloa are a right good team with some really good players and it just showed there’s no one you can take for granted in this league. Every team has good players so it’s about going out, getting your preparation done properly and trying to do the business.“Morton had a couple of good results not so long ago but then lost out to Queens last weekend. That just shows you can only concentrate on yourselves.”Saturday’s victory over Alloa ended a testing spell for the Dark Blues with very disappointing results against Dundee United and then League Two Elgin City.Hamilton said: “It was a well-earned three points on Saturday, I’d say.“There were a lot of challenges flung at us and it was horrible at times, not particularly nice to play in, but a wee bit of character from the boys ground it out and we got the three points we needed.“Saturday was a dficult game and it was good after the previous two weeks just to get that three points and get going again.“We know we’re going to have to face times like that through the season and it’s about learning from things and moving forward as a group.“We have good lads in the dressing-room and a good manager and that’s the direction we want to go.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shock as driver flips car in city street before fleeing the scene","story":"Residents of a city street say they are “amazed” no one was seriously injured after a car overturned in the early hours of yesterday.Police and fire crews closed off Fountainbleau Drive in Linlathen shortly after am to clear the scene and cut down a lamppost damaged in the smash.A police investigation has been launched in an effort to trace the driver who ditched the car.It is understood the vehicle may have been stolen from the Kirkton area before the crash.Neighbours said they saw three young men wearing dark clothing who fled the area shortly after the incident.An unnamed resident said the yellow Vauxhall came to a stop near the skate park before she contacted the fire service. vw, px\"  She said: “I’m amazed no one was seriously injured.“The car landed on its driver’s side and I contacted the fire brigade – I was worried the car might have gone up in flames.”Another neighbour confirmed she had witnessed a group flee the scene.She added: “I’m amazed they came out of that unscathed.”Another resident described hearing a “loud bang” and said he couldn’t understand how the car had ended up landing in that position, near the junction with Rowantree Crescent.He added: “There was no screeching to imply the car was out of control.“It was facing in the direction of Morrisons but it was on the wrong side of the road to be heading that way.“I can’t understand how it’s managed to end up like that.“There were at least  fire crew members on the scene before a lamppost was cut down.”The fire service confirmed two appliances from the Kingsway station attended the scene.Police have urged anyone who may be able to help their investigation to get in touch.A spokeswoman added: “Officers were called to Fountainbleau Drive in Dundee at around .am yesterday following a one-car collision.“The driver had left the scene prior to police arrival and inquiries are ongoing to trace them.“Anyone who witnessed the crash or has other information relevant to the investigation should contact police on .”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/Tomasz-Suprun-846x564.jpg ","title":"university of dundee scoops major accolade for student experience","story":"The University of Dundee has been named University of the Year for Student Experience by The Sunday Times Good University Guide .The title has said that the city is one of the best places in the UK to be a student.Earlier this year the university placed fourth in the UK for overall satisfaction in this year#s National Student Survey.Dundee was also named Best Place to Live in Scotland by the Sunday Times in April.Dundee is THE NUMBER  place to live in Scotland, say influential  of judges\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-is-the-number--place-to-live-in-scotland-say-influential--of-judges embed # secretIXZaKuHrNH\" data-secret\"IXZaKuHrNH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Josh Connor, president of Dundee University Students’ Association , said: “This award won’t be surprising for anyone who studies at the University of Dundee.

remained unchanged in the last  to  years, and while longevity of knee implants has improved signicantly, there are still between -% of patients who state that they are dissatisfied with the outcome of their surgery.This could be for many reasons – pain, poor  flexion or an “unnatural feeling knee” – or a combination of these.A knee replacement is sometimes recommended when the knee joint is damaged and symptoms of pain and limitedare persistent, which is usually caused by osteoarthritis.During surgery, the consultant orthopaedic surgeon will replace the damaged knee joint with an articial one known as an implant or prosthesis.There are times when only one part of the knee is damaged and a partial knee replacement can be performed. vw, px\"  BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen can offer patients a bespoke knee implant known as Conformis iTotal, which is designed and manufactured to fit around the inidual’s anatomy. Following a consultation with one of the trained consultant orthopaedic surgeons, a pre-operative CT scan and D printing technology ensures that the implant is made to match the shape of the knee.The reported benefits of this technology over conventional knee replacement include increased patient satisfaction one year after surgery, with patients . times more likely to have a good or excellent outcome score with a quickerto daily activities. vw, px\"  Mr James Bidwell, FRCS Ed , Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon said: “I have performed  Conformis iTotal total knee replacements at BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen over the last  months.“We have seen excellent results and my patients and I are equally happy with the performance of the knees after surgery. It is good to see patientsto a more natural range of movement in the knee and see them get back to day-to-day activities more quickly.“Nursing staff and physiotherapists have often remarked how quickly iTotal patients get going after surgery and we have had several patients ready to go home on the second day after the operation.“Total knee replacement is a big operation and the risks of continuing pain and stfness after surgery are high. I strongly feel that the use of the Conformis iTotal knee replacement system using a computer-planned, tailor-made fit unique to each patient can give a signicant advantage to patients. It can allow a quickertoand more normal feel to the knee replacement.“The performance of the Conformis iTotal knee replacement is being monitored closely by ODEP . Indications are that it will last longer or at least as long as the best-performing current and traditional total knee replacement implants available.”Mr David Boddie FRCSED , Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon said: “I have been performing the Conformis iTotal total knee replacement for the last  months, since it was introduced at BMI Albyn Hospital.“I have been very impressed by the whole process, from computer design and planning through to implementation of the custom plan at the time of surgery. The implants are manufactured to a very high standard and being monitored for long-term survival and performance. Compared to conventional total knee replacement, two main aspects have impressed me the most one being the perfect custom fit of the implant to the inidual patient’s anatomy and the rapid post-operative recovery patients make, which combined with modern enhanced recovery programmes also facilitates less pain, less swelling, less stfness and a shorter hospital stay.“Osteoarthritis of the knee is a disabling condition total knee replacement is a big operation but is in general a very good operation for relieving the pain and improving patients’ mobility. The Conformis iTotal total knee replacement has been developed in an effort to improve patient experience and al outcome from total knee replacement, which I believe future results will prove given our initial experience and results.”BMI Albyn is hosting a knee pain information event on October   at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Aberdeen Treetops, from . to .pm.This event will give you a chance to learn more about knee pain, along with Conformis iTotal joint replacement.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

later Herbert Coutts, of the community council, suggested it would be ldquobest-served being demolished.Plans to breathe new le into the building and turn it into ldquoa multi-al community space stalled, despite Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh and comedian and radio presenter Fred MacAulay backing the campaign.Mr Adams has written to Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, regarding funding for the building.He stressed the work at the venue would not be on a par with the previous plans to bring it back to le but would simply improve it and make it into a storage area or workshop.A spokesman for East Lothian Council confirmed an application for pound, had been considered by the area partnership, with the Christmas Lights group given pound, last

Landlords or letting agents who are the account holders for energy bills on their property should ask their energy supplier for a smart meter to be installed.Tenants who are the energy account holders should contact their energy supplier directly to ask for a smart meter. Smart meters can remove the hassle of working out how much is owed when they move out of a property and will also help when iding bills amongst flatmates.However, some tenants are hesitant to request a smart meter fitting as they think it is the landlord or letting agentrsquos responsibility. Therefore, itrsquos a good idea to let your tenants know that yoursquore happy for them to have one fitted.Housing associations should provide information to their tenants about the benefits of smart meters, such as the fact that tenants will always know what they are paying for their energy - with a smart meter, they get an easy-to-understand portable display that shows exactly what they are spending in near real time. More transparency around energy usage and costs will help people avoid getting into debt with their energy supplier. The display also shows exactly how much gas and electricity is being used, so tenants will be able to make informed decisions about what appliances might be more costly to use and where they can save both energy and money.Smart meters are a vital investment in the energy infrastructure of Scotland, England and Wales, delivering benefits beyond personal energy savings. And with over  million already installed across Great Britain, many letting agents, landlords, housing associations and tenants are already playing their part in helping to create a more sustainable energy system for the future.Getting a smart meter: FAQsIrsquom a landlord or letting agent, can I arrange a smart meter installation Whoever pays the gas and electricity bills can ask for a smart meter to be fitted. If you pay the energy bills for a tenanted property, you can arrange an installation and should speak to the tenant about an appropriate time for the installation.If your tenant pays the bills, you may wish to provide them with information about the benefits of smart meters and let them know that you are happy for them to arrange an installation.How can Housing Associations get involved There are a number of ways in which you can help support this rollout, includingWho installs the smart meter A qualied installer sent by your energy supplier will fit your new smart meter at the time agreed when arranging your installation. They will show you a photo ID card before they start and they will never request or accept financial payment.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-papers-reveal-people-resolute-determination-journalism-matters","story":"The PapersBBCFour starsPaul EnglishLETrsquoS go for full disclosure.

That was another remarkable thing, that at  she was still playing the piano, all the music stored in her head and performed with apologies that her fingers were not what they were.Upwards of , its quite fine for knuckles to not behave themselves so well.Granny Porteous married Tom in , a union that lead to four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

My cousins will back me up on this, Im sure: our grans were the benchmark of classic grandmotherliness.On her th birthday, in these pages, I lamented that proper grannies are about to go extinct.At the loss of one more I reflected on that again.

My grans could knit, darn and sew .As standard, they could take a pattern and make a dress just as readily as going to the shops. Disposable fashion  No, not after all that effort and certainly not that level of waste - they lived through rationing, you know.Cooking for young women fell out of favour as anti-feminist but these grans could cook and bake, with recipes written on paper, and they would comfort you with food.Any time I visited Granny P the tea and biscuits would be on bone china and cups would rest on saucers.

Her hope that people ldquothink very carefully about the future is sound advice about any subject at anytime.

Nobody is suggesting perfection, but when Mr Bone writes about an \"SNP-dominated Scotland\" he should remember that the SNP is only dominant in Scotland because the voters have awarded it their trust, voting it into power for a third consecutive term at Holyrood and into first place at the EU elections last May.As for \"Scotlands sensible and stoic past\", I believe I am correct in remembering that in the late s when the very idea of a Scottish Parliament was ridiculed by most Unionists, that the amount of time Westminster devoted to purely Scottish affairs was  hours per year. With the SNP as the third-largest party at Westminster these days are in the past and in the past they must remain Scotland has come a long way with the SNP, and the winning post is in sight.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: David Cameron secretly asked the Queen to back the Union in the  Scottish independence campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-nevis-lit-keep-mountain-peak","story":"A record number of walkers and climbers scaled the UKrsquos highest mountain last year.Overall, an astonishing , people conquered the Ben in , according to figures from the charity which manages the ,ft Highland peak.On the busiest days, more than , hikers, runners and charity racers trekked to the summit ndash leading to ldquolong tailbacks at certain points on the main path.Now up to  walkers will scale the peak at night tomorrow to raise money for the Nevis Fund, which is administered by the Nevis Landscape Partnership, with music, poetry and light to add to the experience.: Ben Nevis tragedy climber: \"I wish we had not done that climb\"The Nevis Landscape Partnership is a collective of environmental organisations, local and national, working together to protect and enhance the land of and surrounding Ben Nevis.Among those benefiting will be Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, who carry out around  rescues on the Ben each year.The event has been organised by well-known mountain guide Mike Pescod of Abacus Mountain Guides.Mr Pescod said that around pound, had been spent on repairing the bottom end of the path in recent years but that money had now come to an end.ldquoThere is no central regular fund for maintenance of the path and it is getting busier and busier.

It was a great insight into the everyday challenges of producing the Scottish press at a time of huge material change for the industry.I was impressed by the passion and dedication of the reporters, editors and designers who put together venerable Scottish titles like The Herald and new newspapers like The National and Sunday National.As a regular reader of all three titles Irsquom very grateful for the heroic efforts that go into each issue!Alex Benchimol, GlasgowThe BBC programme, The Papers, increased our awareness of the rapid changes which have taken place within many occupations in recent years. None more so than in the ways by which news, whether domestic or international, is obtained and disseminated.The challenge facing the newspaper industry was brought home clearly in the programme with editors balancing print and digital output. The reliance on freelance contributors was a further indication of the reduction in the numbers of those employed directly in the industry and it was clear that the remaining permanent staff were skilled at performing many roles. It was a sign of the times that the Editor-in-chief, Donald Martin, was responsible for overseeing the production of three titles.While the time honoured expression ldquoHold the front page was not recorded, it was clear that the pressure to produce a topical front page in time to meet the production deadline is just as much to the fore as in times past.There seemed little scope for pursuing investigative journalism given the reduced level of funding, though it is possible that this aspect of journalism may be covered in the next episode.In a changing world, the programme provided a valuable insight into how the newspaper industry is, of necessity, adapting to the ways in which we communicate.It emphasised the responsibility which journalists have to maintain the high level of integrity in the industry in the face of others who would attempt to undermine the trust of readers through their attempts to spread ldquofake news.Malcolm Allan, BishopbriggsIrsquove signed up and subscribed to Herald Scotland this morning as a direct result of the first episode of The Papers documentary, which I thought was fantastic.I have been takingnews for free for years ndash but the programme made me clearly and deeply understand the importance of impartial newsand the thought of losing this vitally important voice and resource would be incredibly damaging.

The loss of forest, habitat and wildle is shocking to witness. In Scotland, as in the Amazon, a great forest has been here before but has now gone after centuries of use, depleted until the final old trees decline and fall. Across the Scottish Highlands, over many centuries, grazing by goats, sheep, cattle and wild deer along with felling for timber and farmland, has removed this precious woodland from the hills of Scotland. We need that great forest again ndash now more than ever. Capturing carbon, helping community resilience, reducing flooding risk, improving soils, nurturing bioersity and offering a wonderland for people to explore ndash these are some of the benefits that a rewilded Caledonian Forest can bring.While human activity has been the cause of the loss of so much forest in Scotland and around the world, people are vital to its future. Much of the work Trees for Le has done so far has been with the help of thousands of volunteers who have joined us toforest to remote mountains. As we work in more places at a bigger scale we know that landowners, local communities and businesses need to thrive alongside the wild forest. This means working together to strike the right balance between a forest that can take care of itself and humans being able to make a living from it. The Trees for Le vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildle to flourish and communities to thrive.We welcome action that shines a light on the climate crisis. It is time for those who hold power, from landowners to Governments, to act on what the science has been telling us for decades. We believe that rewilding answers many of the urgent questions climate change is asking. We also recognise it is not the only solution. A mix of solutions is requiredwe are to reverse the effects of humankindrsquos damage to the environment.Scotland was the first country in the world to declare a climate emergency. As a nation leading this agenda we must recognise the time for discussion and debate is over. The solutions to reverse the effects of climate change are available now. Our children are asking for action now. We must respond with action now.bull Steve Micklewright is CEO of Trees for Le:CLAIRE MACKWith some of the planetrsquos most ambitious renewable energy and carbon targets, Scotland is already a world leader on climate action.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival, which is underway right now , is highlighting our industryrsquos successes to date and our ambitious plans for the future.The announcement earlier this month that the UNrsquos th climate change conference is coming to Glasgow in  gives us a new opportunity, too.Itrsquos an opportunity to make Scotland one of the most climate-savvy nations on Earth.And thatrsquos an opportunity with energy at its heart.Globally, the energy industry is on a multi-trillion dollar journey to decarbonisation, but the production of energy is still one of the largest sources of the carbon emissions which are damaging our planet.Yes, Scotlandrsquos electricity sector no longer belches smoke skywards, and this is certainly something to be proud of.But heat makes up almost double the carbon emissions of electricity. We havenrsquot even scratched the surface of decarbonising it.Transport, too, is a huge issue, and one which can only be resolvedthe public changes the habits of a letime.Those of us who drive a petrol car know its emissions are an issue. But the excuses for choosing fossil fuel over an electric vehicle are all too easy to come up with.And itrsquos the same for heat. When your boiler breaks down, would you be willing to pay more in the short-term for a heat pump, or connect to a district heating network Again, the excuses are many: the short-term costs are too high. The long-term benefits of these choices are too distant. Itrsquos easier to stick our heads in the sand.But therersquos only so long we can ignore the truth: climate change is a threat multiplier.A poll this week found climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy.Therersquos no more important aspect of our lives to rethink than how we, personally, tackle it.Todayrsquosprotests are part of that story, but so too are the energy industryrsquos actions.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival is an opportunity to look forward, past COP and medium-term targets, to a low-carbon energy system with renewables at its heart.Irsquom proud that my industry is doing so much to achieve that vision, and heartened that so many people share it.bull Claire Mack, is Chief Executive at Scottish Renewables: The full list of climate strikes taking place across ScotlandMARK RUSKELLThis week the figurehead of the climate strikers, Greta Thunberg, was in front of US Congress.ldquoI donrsquot want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists, she told US lawmakers.Instead of a written submission, the Swedish teenager handed over the landmark IPCC report, published last year, which gives governments only a decade to slow global warming.That stark warning, based on scientic evidence and which governments signed up to, is what our young people are articulating through direct action today.Thousands of Scottish children and young people share Gretarsquos message. They are telling us to look at the scientic evidence which tells us that the majority of fossil fuels must be left in the ground. They are telling us to plant more trees and save endangered species. They are telling us to get on with it, fast.The Scottish Government claim to be listening to them, butwe look at what our leaders are actually offering in , it seems to me that the message is just not getting through.For example, Nicola Sturgeon likes to talk about Scotlandrsquos lsquoworld-leading targetsrsquo to reduce emissions. But the timescale bares little resemblance to the ten years the IPCC gives us for meaningful change. By the time we meet the net-zero target of , the IPCCrsquos point of nowill be  years old. Greta Thunberg will be .I will be putting forward an amendment to the Scottish Governmentrsquos climate bill which will see an % reduction in emissions by the IPCCrsquos deadline, and I hope that every MSP will put our common future first and back it.But targets arenrsquot enough. Indeed, Scotland missed its existing emissions targets last year.Ultimately, itrsquos action that counts. Bold, ambitious action like a nation-wide programme of works to make every home in Scotland warm, efficient and low carbon, shting billions out of new motorways and into public transport up so people donrsquot need to rely on cars, and reforesting Scotland up to at least the European average.My fear is that this message has not got through to the majority of politicians in Holyrood and around the world. Rhetoric and eye-catching targets will not meet the demands of young people. Next weekrsquos vote on the climate bill must mark the beginning of transformative change.Like Greta told Congress, our young people are telling the UK and Scottish Governments: ldquoYoursquore not trying hard enough.bull Mark Ruskell is MSP for Mid Scotland and FeDR RICHARD DIXONWhen I met -year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg briefly at the climate summit in Katowice in Poland last year I thanked her for all she was doing to bring attention to the need for more climate action. At that point she had been holding her own personal climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament for five months. This had sparked a global movement of school children striking for the climate and, already on her meteoric rise to global prominence, she at the climate conference to give a speech in front of the UN Secretary General.Of course since then she has spoken at the World Economic Forum, in front of huge crowds in a number of languages and to EU leaders. And she has just sailed across an ocean so she can speak at the UN climate summit in New York next week. Politicians who care about climate change are queuing up to be seen with her and last week she was protesting outside the White House with thousands of US students.The movement she started has gone from strength to strength, becoming the largest youth-led movement ever. There have been school strikes across the world and a week of action starts today with millions of people ndash children and adults this time - expected to take part in thousands of marches, rallies and strikes in  countries.Today there will be climate strikes in at least  places in Scotland, including marches with thousands of people expected in Edinburgh and Glasgow.Irsquove been outside Parliament several times to see the climate strikes including the two very impressive big rallies, one where about , young people came and went over a number of hours. The children had organised all this themselves.Over the last decade Irsquove mostly found the speeches at rallies and marches rather dull ndash even when itrsquos me giving the speech! But the children outside Parliament gave speech after speech that was really worth listening to.Irsquoll be there again today because it is really inspiring and heart-warming to see young people and their supporters taking action in such huge numbers on climate change. It is young peoplersquos future that we are all trashing with our lack of urgent action after all. I hope to see you on the streets.bull Dr Richard Dixon is Director of Friends of the Earth ScotlandTAMARA VAN STRIJTHEMAll across the world, activists have been campaigning for governments, corporations and iniduals to wake up to the climate change emergency.The causes and ramications of climate change are multiple and complex ndash and so are the efforts of campaigners and activists working towards a more sustainable world. Some of these are brought to le, and to our screens, by Take One Film Festival in Scotland.Here Tamara Van Strijthem, Festival Director, explains how it began, what it hopes to achieve, and what films you should go and see.The th edition of Take One Action, the UKrsquos leading social and environmental justice film festival is currently underway in Edinburgh and Glasgow. TThe festival was founded on the premise that shared cinematic experiences can support, ignite and sustain peoplersquos social change journeys: our programme offers audiences an opportunity to see the change they want to be.Exploring, questioning and challenging how we relate to global issues is the drive behind our work ndash and there are few global issues more pressing than climate change. Our Shared Planet strand interrogates current environmental challenges in the face of growing climate chaos and asks how we move beyond awareness ndash to meaningful action. Two of the films selected celebrate the role of youth activism in pushing the climate agenda forward. Grit explores a young womanrsquos evolving sense of her power as an activist, in an Indonesian community devastated by a fracking disaster.Inventing Tomorrow , sees teenage science students tackle some of the most pressing dangers faced by their communities, at the forefront of environmental destruction.Connecting with local issues is also crucial. The question at the heart of French documentary Time of Forests ndash the need to preserve forests as wild nature, not as tree plantations, and the potential role of rewilding in re-dressing bioersity ndash is particularly pertinent for Scotland, while Eating up Easterhas obvious echoes for Scotlandrsquos many island communities.Soyalism investigates the effects of industrialised meat production on humans, animals and the planet, while the latest film by photographer Edward Burtynsky, Anthropocene, explores the irreparable ways in which human activity has been transforming the planet over the last century.Many of the screenings are presented in partnership with members of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland all screenings are followed by audience discussions with campaigners, activists, scientists and journalists.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Climate change is speeding up sea level rise and the increasing regularity of violent storm events means the coastal archaeology is also rapidly vanishing.#Please help us record the sites and the stories of everyday maritime Shetland before it is too late.”Moder Dy is run entirely voluntarily with the non-financial support of Shetland Amenity Trust, Archaeology Shetland and Scotland’s Coastal Heritage at Risk .

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set. Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron says he faced ira members during stormont negotiations in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Thankfully, that tends to be regarded as a bit extreme these days..pushChloe Adair should be no exception. Her father, Johnny, shamed the family name as one of Northern Irelands most notorious loyalist paramilitaries, but that has nothing to do with his daughter. The up-and-coming Instagram personality, who left Belfast when she was only , is not her fathers keeper.Read MoreSocial media style icon Chloe Adair insists her familys past doesnt define her dream role as an online influencerTheres something ugly about this ancient superstition that who you are as a person is defined by kinship but too often here, people are still expected to be interchangeable with their blood relations. Thats what happens in small, closed communities. Everyone is defined in relation to each other.As soon as you meet someone new, they want to place you. Arent you the son or daughter of so-and-so  Didnt your cousin do such-and-such  Its only natural to try and map those social connections. It becomes a problem when someone decides they know everything about you just because theyre in possession of a few factlets.The Troubles produced many bad people. In due course, they had children of their own. It really shouldnt come as a shock that some of them took radically dferent paths, certainly not to anyone whos had children of their own.It would be an awful world in which children turned into carbon copies of their mothers and fathers.If Chloe was to defend her fathers paramilitary past, then it would be perfectly justied to criticise her for it. The same would applyshe used her social media  to spread hate or ision. But she doesnt. She posts harmless messages about fashion. Pictures of her parents must rouse dark memories to those whose lives were touched by Johnny Adair but its he who must answer for his crimes, not his daughter.That Chloe has forged her own way in le, independent of her parentage, ought to be seen as an achievement, rather than a puzzle. If anything, she is now the positive role model that he failed to be in his own le.Children should never be judged by the sins of their parents, but they can sometimes put right a few of those sins by rejecting the toxic example theyve been given and going on to live better, more productive lives."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38513717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_108859437_charlie.jpg","title":"farmer who appeared in dup campaign regrets brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

QIH said his departure was \"by mutual agreement\", but Mr Quinn says he was \"sacked\".Speaking on Shannonside Radio, Mr Quinn said: \"My reaction would be the same as anybody . It would be a sense of outrage.\"He continued: \"It would appear to me to be a fairly barbaric attack … Any proper inidual, anybody with any sense or any morals, would of course condemn that.\"That man has a we and kids. Of course you would condemn it totally.\"But the former billionaire questioned why the finger of blame was being pointed in the direction of his family.\"My family has been on and they are outraged as well. They have been on to me that we are going to take the flak for this and we have been blamed for this and that some people will look our direction at it,\" he said. Mr Quinn said he had \"no correspondence or no dealings, no arguments, no fights\" with QIH since his departure. \"I dont want to be seen as trying to push it off and only condemning it partially. I am condemning it totally and absolutely. There is no way around that. I am just saying it shouldnt still be linked that Sean Quinn is the man that has to condemn this,\" he said.Mr Quinn claimed there was \"an awful lot of conflict\" in relation to the company in recent times in the form of legal proceedings issued against \"former directors, managers, staff, neighbours and friends\".But he insisted he was not caught up in the conflict.QIH director John McCartin said any condemnation of the attack by Mr Quinn was of little comfort. \"What we need is not only those who directly perpetrate these crimes to be brought to heel, but whoever is instigating, procuring and paying for them also to be brought to heel,\" he said.Yesterday, two leading Northern Ireland trade bodies condemned the \"vicious\" attack on Mr Lunney. Gordon Best, regional director of the Mineral Products Association NI, said the attack had come as a \"real shock to us all\".\"Kevin is held in high regard right across the construction materials and manufacturing industry in Ireland and further afield,\" he added.\"In fact I met with Kevin just two weeks ago when Quinn Building Products hosted our health and safety committee in Derrylin. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Kevin and his family at this dficult time and we wish him a speedy recovery.\"Stephen Kelly, CEO of Manufacturing NI, said: \"The unwarranted assault on Kevin is also an attack on the  employees at Quinns, the whole community in and around Derrylin where the company provides so many jobs and support the local economy, and the entire manufacturing industry across Ireland.\"Kevin and his family are very much in our thoughts and this time and I want to assure him of our best wishes,\" he added.Mr Best and Mr Kelly also said that they would be seeking a meeting with the PSNI Chief Constable, Simon Byrne, to discuss this \"vile\" attack on one of their members directors and to examine in what way their associations can assist the police on both sides of the border to stop the attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week."},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London.

We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception.
