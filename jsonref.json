I pay £63,000 a year in business rates and what do I have to show for it? When I call the police they don\u0027t care.\u0027On Wednesday he and some other villagers chased a gang of traveller thieves into a Sainsbury\u0027s car park and \u0027kettled\u0027 them in, he said.\u0027They were holding all this stolen property and caught red-handed. I flagged down a police car and told the officer what had happened and he just drove off.\u0027The gang escaped by climbing over the wall, he added.Alistair Mann, 57, the chairman of the local Chambers of Commerce, has also had a number of altercations with the travellers.\u0027The problem is that the police don\u0027t get rid of them so they keep coming back,\u0027 he said. \u0027Cobham is seen as a soft touch. The traffic wardens don\u0027t even issue them tickets.\u0027Locals are already starting to take matters into their own hands. There has been lots of repeated talk about getting a possé together.\u0027Mr Mann intends to refuse to pay any further parking tickets until traffic wardens treat the travellers like everybody else, he said. \u0027You\u0027re looking at civil unrest,\u0027 he said.Last night a terrified elderly lady called 999 after seeing a group of travellers trying to set fire to the hedges outside her house. \u0027The police said they\u0027d send a panda car but they never did,\u0027 Mr Mann said.

The event takes its name from the 1976 comedy movie The Gumball Rally and raises funds for youth projects.Cooper also reportedly chose the term ‘Gumball’ to describe the rally because iconic artist Andy Warhol used it to describe the way that the population chews up and eventually spits out pop culture like gum.The inaugural rally, in which Cooper and about 50 of his friends participated, took place between London and Rimini, Italy, passing through cities like Paris along the way.The 2001 rally, which stretched between London and Berlin, Germany, is often seen as a turning point for the race as its popularity and global awareness rose sharply around that time.In 2002, the rally moved from Europe to the United States, starting in New York City and ending in Los Angeles, California, passing iconic landmarks like the White House in Washington, D.C. and the Grand Canyon in Arizona along the way.In 2004, the race returned to Europe, taking place between Paris and Cannes, France. Sadly, the 2007 rally ended early after a traffic accident in Macedonia resulted in the deaths of two nonparticipants.The 2008 and 2009 rallies were held entirely in the United States while the 2010 rally was notably the first transatlantic race as participants were flown between Europe and the U.S. The 2014 and 2015 rallies also featured a similar transatlantic route, flying participants between Miami, Florida and Ibiza, Spain in 2014 and Stockholm, Sweden and Las Vegas in 2015.When is the 2018 Gumball 3000 Rally?The rally is set to begin on Saturday, August 4 and continue until Sunday, August 12.2018 Gumball 3000 Rally trophyTo commemorate the 20th anniversary of the rally, Asprey has made a new ‘Spirit of Gumball’ trophy to mark the event. Modelled after a vintage gumball machine, it will be revealed to the public at the rally’s official launch party in London.Asprey Chairman John Rigas expressed enthusiasm at being part of the celebrity motor rally, stating: ‘We are delighted to host Gumball at the Asprey Mayfair flagship and thrilled to join the Gumball 3000 rally.

And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\u0027So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself. I want you to challenge yourself.\u0027I want you to stop gossiping, to try a food that scares you, to buy a coffee for someone just because, to tell someone you love them…and then to tell yourself right back. I want you to find your happiness.\u0027Markle used her blog as a platform to express her feelings about her personal life and past experiences growing up as well. In one post, she described the ‘constant battle’ of her ‘brutal’ 20s that involved incessantly judging her own weight and style choices.           Markle used her now-defunct blog to express personal feelings and recount past experiences\u0027My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as coolas hipas smartas “whatever” as everyone else.\u0027My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls.\u0027Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. So every day during lunch, I busied myself with meetings – French club, student body, whatever one could possibly do between noon and 1pm, I was there. Not so that I was more involved, but so that I wouldn’t have to eat alone,’ she wrote.For her birthday, Markle is reportedly planning to celebrate in Surrey at the wedding of Daisy Jenks and Charlie Van Straubenzee, one of Prince Harry’s best friends who also served as an usher at the Royal Wedding.Per Royal tradition, birthdays are usually low-key affairs celebrated at home.

The \u0027spiteful\u0027 jibe by the Labour leader was reportedly aimed at Louise Ellman (pictured)Another senior Labour source said Dame Louise was commonly referred to as \u0027the Hon Member of Tel Aviv\u0027 by members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s staff. \u0027If her name crops up, or she appears on the office TV, they\u0027ll say, \u0027There she goes again, the Honourable member for Tel Aviv.\u0027 They can\u0027t stand her.\u0027 Last night, Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, condemned Mr Corbyn\u0027s \u0027spiteful\u0027 comment.Born into a Jewish family in Manchester, Dame Louise, 72, was chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement until 2016 and is vice chairman of the Labour Friends of Israel. She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years. Labour has become an institutionally anti-Semitic Party under Jeremy Corbyn. It will not change while he is leader.\u0027 Dame Louise said last night: \u0027If this is correct, I am appalled that a potential Prime Minister would use language of this sort against one of his own MPs.\u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country.\u0027A key part the internationally accepted code on anti-Semitism which the Labour Party wants to dilute specifically states it is anti-Semitic to accuse Jews of being more loyal to Israel than to their own country.\u0027A Labour spokesman said last night that the allegation that Mr Corbyn had called Dame Louise the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027entirely untrue\u0027. He also said, in relation to the 2012 pro-Palestinian meeting, that Mr Corbyn \u0027was not responsible for everything said at every meeting he has ever attended\u0027."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/09/4ED8397500000578-6027405-image-a-10_1533458111258.jpg","title":"Fox says no deal Brexit likely agreement Brussels","story":"    The UK appears set to crash out of the European Union without a Brexit deal due to the \u0027intransigence\u0027 of the Brussels machine, Liam Fox (pictured) has claimed          Theresa May and her husband Philip arrive for a church service near to her Maidenhead constituency this morning\u0027We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit – not a people\u0027s Brexit – then there is only going to be one outcome.\u0027He said Mr Barnier had dismissed the UK\u0027s proposals in the Chequers plan thrashed out by Theresa May and the Cabinet simply because \u0027we have never done it before\u0027.The Government has admitted its proposals are unprecedented, but Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0027s response \u0027makes the chance of no deal greater\u0027.Brexit is no joke, Lord Feldman rages at Michael Gove:...Share this articleThe Prime Minister held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, cutting short her holiday to visit his summer retreat.And ministers including Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have also engaged in diplomatic activity in Europe in recent days as the Government seeks to deal directly with inidual governments in an effort to keep the Chequers plan alive.In a sign that member states are being warned of the consequences of the failure to find a deal, Dr Fox said: \u0027It\u0027s up to the EU27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0027s ideological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.\u0027Meanwhile, former cabinet minister Priti Patel said Mrs May must ditch the Chequers plan, which would see a \u0027common rulebook\u0027 for goods with the EU – effectively tying the UK to terms set by Brussels.

Researchers blamed over-crowded wards and staffing shortages, but NHS officials insisted the rise was mostly down to better classification.Sepsis occurs when the body over-reacts to an everyday infection or virus. It is commonly triggered by a skin infection, chest infection, pneumonia or the flu.The illness is notoriously difficult to diagnose and patients\u0027 risk of death significantly increases for every hour they are not given antibiotics.The alert system developed by Cambridge University Hospitals works by constantly analysing patients\u0027 observations, as recorded by staff on handheld devices. These include temperature, pulse, blood pressure and level of consciousness which are taken at various stages as patients are assessed in A\u0026ampE.Bride-to-be, 35, died of suspected sepsis just hours after...Share this articleIf the observations suggest a patient might have sepsis, a text-message warning appears on the hand-held device of the doctor or nurse looking after them.Doctors at Cambridge University say the system is undoubtedly saving lives. They are now working alongside NHS England to roll it out in other hospitals.There are 250,000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year and it claims 44,000 lives, meaning one in six patients will die. The Mail has been campaigning to improve the care of patients with sepsis since 2016, following the tragic case of one-year-old William Mead.He died from the condition in Treliske Hospital, near Truro in Cornwall after GPs and other staff missed the warning signs.          Sepsis occurs when the body over-reacts to an everyday infection or virus. It is commonly triggered by a skin infection, chest infection, pneumonia or the flu (stock image)His mother Melissa Mead praised the alert system\u0027s potential to save lives. \u0027If you\u0027ve got a seven-fold increase in patients receiving antibiotics within an hour, that speaks volumes,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s a wonderful thing. The blueprint has been written by clinicians and people on the front-line and they know what works.\u0027The only way for doctors to diagnose sepsis is to closely monitor patients\u0027 breathing, temperature, blood pressure, blood oxygen and alertness. But many patients who go to A\u0026ampE are seen by different doctors and nurses who take different measurements. This means no one health professional is looking at all the measurements together, and checking to see if they have worsened.Cambridge University Hospitals Trust introduced the system in the A\u0026ampE unit of its main hospital Addenbrookes in August 2016. In July 2015, only 11 per cent of patients with possible sepsis were given antibiotics within an hour of arriving at A\u0026ampE. This had increased to 76 per cent by August 2016. Since then the figure has ranged from 72 to 86 per cent.Dr Sian Coggle, an infectious diseases consultant who is the trust\u0027s clinical lead for sepsis, said: \u0027It\u0027s not just lives saved, it\u0027s the whole morbidity associated with severe sepsis.

Both methods have been used to erode the green belt, the report said. Between 201112 and 201617 nearly 4,900 hectares of green belt have lost their protected status in local plans – the equivalent of a city the size of Middlesbrough, housing ministry figures show.The report said that in the past four years, 11,000 hectares of green belt land – a city the size of Bristol – have also been built on for industrial, commercial or residential purposes.

But the CPRE said there was no need to pave over the countryside when there are sufficient urban ‘brownfield’ sites in towns and cities that could provide some 720,000 homes.Brownfield sites include wasteland, derelict or disused sites such as old warehouses or factories.The CPRE said that over the past six years ‘too many local authorities and developers have been taking a lax view of what exceptional means... allocating green belt sites for development as an easy option rather than as a last resort.’          Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt\u0027 (Protesters in Borehamwood campaigning against development on green belt land)The CPRE also calculated that of the homes built on the green belt in the past nine years, 72 per cent were not ‘affordable’ under the Government’s definitions, so they do little to reduce the housing shortage.Critics fear it may become even easier to build on green belt land.Last year the Government unveiled its Housing White Paper containing ambitious plans to build a million new homes by 2020. It said the green belt would not lose any of its protections. But critics noted ‘exceptional circumstances’ could include housing requirements – in effect watering down safeguards.Tom Fyans, of the CPRE, said: ‘We are being sold a lie by many developers. As they sell off and gobble up the green belt to build low-density, unaffordable housing, young families go on struggling to afford a place to live.‘The affordable housing crisis must be addressed with increasing urgency, while acknowledging that far from providing the solution, building on the green belt only serves to entrench the issue. The Government is failing in its commitment to protect the green belt – it is being eroded at an alarming rate.’The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ‘We are clear building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside.‘Last year the number of new homes built was the highest in a decade, and only 0.02 per cent of the green belt was developed for residential use.‘We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt.’   We\u0027re fighting to half houses here... public services just cannot copeby Sami QuadriHundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes.They have taken to the streets with placards and chanted ‘Hands off green belt!’ in a demonstration against the development that would bring 58 houses and a primary school.

The crisis erupted last month after Labour’s ruling NEC – dominated by Corbynistas – refused to adopt the full internationally-accepted definition of anti-Semitism.It meant that the party’s code of conduct only accepts seven of the 11 examples of anti-Semitism as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.

It comes after Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured) warned the party faces being lost in a \u0027vortex of eternal shame\u0027 unless it addresses the concerns of the Jewish communityYesterday, in a new video, Mr Corbyn said driving out anti-Semitism and working with the Jewish community were ‘vital priorities’.He apologised for the hurt caused by the crisis, but made no mention, for example, of his decision to host an event in Parliament where Israel was compared to the Nazis. He was also filmed at a rally in 2010 comparing the plight of the Palestinians with those who suffered the Nazi sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad.Last night Labour Friends of Israel said Mr Corbyn’s words would continue to lack credibility so long as he refused to apologise ‘for the many occasions on which he himself has offended the Jewish community’. Gideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: ‘It is just another contradictory, hypocritical, insincere attempt to whitewash his own role as the author of this nightmare.’Tal Ofer, member of the Board of Deputies, tweeted: ‘You had three years, you did nothing. Time to go.’ Karen Pollock, of the Holocaust Education Trust, said: ‘False equivocations, denial and distortion of the Holocaust are incorrect, inappropriate, hurtful and wrong. Why in 2018 do we still find ourselves having to explain the offence this causes to not only Holocaust survivors, but to the Jewish community? To do it once is a mistake, twice perhaps careless, but multiple times? Deliberate.’In a joint statement, the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council said: ‘He should remember that inaction in the face of racism is complicity.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/05/19/4EDBD91D00000578-0-image-m-5_1533492721698.jpg","title":"ANDREW PIERCE Jeremy Corbyn putting big left foot it","story":"    Even the most ardent of Comrade Corbyn’s supporters must concede that his much vaunted fight back against anti-Semitism has imploded spectacularlyIn a video message, the Labour leader had urged his Party members to attend ‘Southwark Transformed’, an event held on Saturday in London by Momentum, the hard-Left organisation established to bolster Corbyn’s leadership.One of the speakers was none other than Marc Wadsworth, a veteran Corbyn supporter who, in 2016, had been involved in a verbal confrontation with Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth.

Gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail (left) and her husband consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby (right) are alleged to have paid Miss Hemdan only £400 in five months of work after hiring her to look after their four-year-old son in 2011In addition to free board at the couple\u0027s home, she was supposed to be paid £200 per month for working eight hours per day, six days per week. Miss Hemdan claims the payments stopped after two months, earning only £400. This means she was paid less than 50p an hour for five months of work, based on a 45-hour work week.  At one point in August when she complained about the alleged conditions, Dr Safaa became \u0027furious\u0027, it is claimed.In her witness statement, Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa became furious and began to shout at Miss Hemdan, as she did so pushing her up the stairs.\u0027Miss Hemdan was then locked in one of the bedrooms.\u0027Miss Hemdan was told that she could come out when she apologised.\u0027She was instructed to remain in her room and did so for two days before being allowed out of the room.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal: \u0027I was in my room for two days and no one brought me any food or water.\u0027I was too frightened to leave the room as I was scared of Dr Safaa. I was able to drink water from the sink in the bathroom.\u0027She added: \u0027I was treated as a servant and often told that I was a servant.\u0027The nanny alleged to the tribunal Dr Safaa was responsible for much of the treatment.She once told Miss Hemdan \u0027that she had girls working for her before and that if they didn\u0027t like things then she sold them on\u0027, it is alleged.          Miss Hemdan said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom  with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom. She also claimed they took her passport from her and made veiled threats to sell her. Pictured: Dr Safaa Ismail on MondayMiss Hemdan said: \u0027I was shocked when she said this.\u0027I remember I said \u0027\u0027sold them\u0027\u0027, because I was so shocked, and Dr Safaa said \u0027\u0027yes\u0027\u0027 if you sell the passport the girl follows it like a dog.\u0027On another occasion, when Miss Hemdan visited the bank with the doctor, she was asked if she would be willing to sell her kidney, it is alleged.Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa told me that she was talking to the bank manager about her illness as she had a kidney problem.\u0027As we were leaving, Dr Safaa said to me that some people sell a kidney to another person who needs one. I did not know what to say.\u0027Dr Safaa waited a moment and then asked me what did I think about that? I answered that if someone would do it, it would be a human and good thing to do.\u0027Dr Safaa replied: \u0027\u0027Are you willing?\u0027\u0027. I said no, that I was talking in general, not about my own kidney.\u0027Dr Safaa said that she could get me £25,000 if I agreed to give \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 my kidney.\u0027I believe that when she said \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 she meant her and the bank manager.\u0027I said no, I could not possibly do this. I said that we do not own our kidneys, they are given to us by Allah.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal she was given an en-suite guest room in the family\u0027s loft during the stay.She said: \u0027If Dr Safaa was upset with me she would not let me sleep in my bedroom.Lilly Becker accuses family nanny of spying for estranged...Star of Chicago PD claims that a Wall Street mogul who had...Is this Meghan and Harry\u0027s manor?

I am not ignorant like you\u0027\u0027.\u0027She added: \u0027The food I was given was what was left over once the family had eaten their fill.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal she fled the house in October, when the couple moved from London to Coventry.The nanny was made to \u0027carry out the packing and moving\u0027 because professional movers were \u0027too expensive\u0027, it is alleged.She would be driven from Coventry to London \u0027twice a day\u0027 to help with the move, but one day was left at the London home while Dr Al-Meghraby went for lunch, the tribunal heard.Miss Hemdan ran away before contacting her family in Egypt, who said they had been threatened, the tribunal heard.She said: \u0027Dr Safaa had called my brother and told him that they could give someone £10,000 to have me killed.\u0027Both doctors deny all of the claims made by Miss Hemdan and said she had full access to food and living facilities.They say the nanny was paid in full before she left with \u0027no explanation\u0027.The couple stood trial in a criminal court for trafficking, false imprisonment and holding Miss Hemdan in servitude.But after two juries could not agree on a verdict they were formally cleared by a judge.Miss Hemdan is now claiming failure to provide written terms and conditions, race discrimination, failure to pay wages and failure to allow or pay her holiday leave.The tribunal was reserved for judgement at a later date."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/06/00/4EDCEE6F00000578-0-image-m-33_1533511870793.jpg","title":"Recruitment firm fruit pickers summer gets just TWO applications 10 000 Brits","story":"    Workers on the award winning Snell family farm can earn up to £100 per day and are almost exclusively foreign nationals According to Maurel the physical toll of the job, and the fact farms are not in cities with high unemployment rates are to blame for the lack of Brits taking on the job.There is often no way of people being able to afford to reach the farms for the work, unless they live nearby, the recruitment boss said.European workers are often offered accommodation in a trailer in the area while they work.This summer 300 workers are running the farm at AJ and CI Snell in Herefordshire.Among them are four university students and graduates.Blackberry harvester Max Hughes, 20, is one of them.

Pictures show coalition-backed fighters advancing on Yemen\u0027s Red Sea port town of Mocha in January 2017Key participants in the pacts said the U.S. was aware of the arrangements and held off on any drone strikes as the al-Qaeda fighters retreated in plain sight.The AP\u0027s findings are based on reporting in Yemen and interviews with two dozen officials, including Yemeni security officers, militia commanders, tribal mediators and four members of al-Qaeda\u0027s branch. All but a few of those sources spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals.

In that fight, al-Qaeda is effectively on the same side as the coalition - and, by extension, the United States.The U.S. has sent the coalition billions of dollars in weapons to fight the Houthis, and American jets provide air-to-air refueling for coalition war planes. The U.S. does not fund the coalition, however, and there is no evidence that American money went to AQAP militants.          The Saudi led coalition has claimed \u0027again and again\u0027 to have made decisive victories over the past two years, forcing militants to abandon their strongholds in the war-torn country. Pictured: A coalition fighter helps an injured man during  military operation last year\u0027Elements of the U.S. military are clearly aware that much of what the U.S. is doing in Yemen is aiding AQAP and there is much angst about that,\u0027 said Michael Horton, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S. analysis group that tracks terrorism.But supporting allies against \u0027what the U.S. views as Iranian expansionism takes priority over battling AQAP and even stabilizing Yemen,\u0027 Horton said.The AP found that coalition-funded militia commanders actively recruit al-Qaeda militants - considered to be exceptional fighters - or fighters who until very recently were members of the group.Abdel-Sattar al-Shamiri, a former adviser to the governor of Taiz province, said he recognized al-Qaeda\u0027s presence from the start and told commanders not to recruit members.\u0027Their response was, `We will unite with the devil in the face of Houthis,\u0027\u0027 al-Shamiri said.A militia commander in Taiz, known as Aboul Abbas, was put on the U.S. terrorism list for al-Qaeda ties last year. But he continues to receive money from the UAE for his militia, his aide Adel al-Ezzi told the AP. Al-Ezzi rejected the U.S. accusation, denying any terrorism links. Soon after his comments, the AP saw him meeting with a known AQAP commander.Another Taiz commander - Adnan Rouzek, who was recently given $12 million by Yemen\u0027s president for his fighting force - has a known al-Qaeda figure as his closest aide.The U.S. is aware of an al-Qaeda presence among anti-Houthi ranks, a senior American official told reporters in Cairo earlier this year. Because coalition members back militias with hard-line Islamic commanders, \u0027it\u0027s very, very easy for al-Qaeda to insinuate itself into the mix,\u0027 the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under the briefing\u0027s terms.          An explosion raises a cloud as coalition-backed fighters advance on the Red Sea port town of Mocha in Yemen in 2017The Pentagon denied any complicity with al-Qaeda.\u0027Since the beginning of 2017, we have conducted more than 140 strikes to remove key AQAP leaders and disrupt its ability to use ungoverned spaces to recruit, train and plan operations against the U.S. and our partners across the region,\u0027 spokesman Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson said in an email.\u0027Our regional partners have a proven track record of aggressively pursuing terrorist organizations and denying them safe haven in Yemen and DOD does not have any reason to doubt their resolve,\u0027 he wrote.The Saudi-led coalition commented by saying it \u0027continues its commitment to combat extremism and terrorism.\u0027The UAE did not respond to repeated requests for comment.In early 2016, al-Qaeda pulled out of the southern port city of Mukalla and seven areas in the nearby Abyan province, under deals reached with the UAE, according to five military, security and government officials and four tribal mediators involved in the Abyan arrangement.That agreement included a provision that 10,000 local tribesmen - including 250 al-Qaeda militants - would be incorporated into the Security Belt, the UAE-backed Yemeni force in the area, an al-Qaeda negotiator and two Security Belt commanders said.An accord for the withdrawal in February from the town of al-Said in Shabwa province went further, the AP found. The coalition promised payments to al-Qaeda members who left, according to Shabwa\u0027s security chief Awad al-Dahboul, a mediator and two government officials.Al-Dahboul said about 200 al-Qaeda members received payments. He did not know the exact amounts, but said 100,000 Saudi rials ($26,000) were handed over to one al-Qaeda leader in the presence of Emirati commanders.Thousands of tribal fighters, including AQAP members, also were to be taken into the UAE-funded Shabwa Elite militia, the mediator and two officials said.Al-Shamiri, the former official from Taiz, warned that the militants will be difficult to uproot after filtering into such roles. \u0027We will get rid of Houthis and we will be struck with terrorist groups.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/04/21/4ED5953C00000578-6027151-image-m-90_1533415160411.jpg","title":"Corbyn allegedly called Dame Louise Ellman Honourable Member Tel Aviv","story":"    Incriminating footage: Jeremy Corbyn addressing a pro-Palestinian rally in 2012 at which another speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the NazisDame Louise has frequently criticised Mr Corbyn for failing to tackle anti-Semitism. It has led to repeated attempts by Left-wing activists in the pro-Corbyn Momentum group to sack her as MP for Liverpool Riverside.A former aide to Mr Corbyn told The Mail on Sunday that they had heard him describe Dame Louise sarcastically as \u0027the Honourable Member for Tel Aviv\u0027 when her name was mentioned. \u0027I was very surprised and when I asked other members of staff they said he often did it in private, though not to her face,\u0027 said the Labour insider.          The \u0027spiteful\u0027 jibe by the Labour leader was reportedly aimed at Louise Ellman (pictured)Another senior Labour source said Dame Louise was commonly referred to as \u0027the Hon Member of Tel Aviv\u0027 by members of Mr Corbyn\u0027s staff. \u0027If her name crops up, or she appears on the office TV, they\u0027ll say, \u0027There she goes again, the Honourable member for Tel Aviv.\u0027 They can\u0027t stand her.\u0027 Last night, Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle, condemned Mr Corbyn\u0027s \u0027spiteful\u0027 comment.Born into a Jewish family in Manchester, Dame Louise, 72, was chairman of the Jewish Labour Movement until 2016 and is vice chairman of the Labour Friends of Israel. She denounced Mr Corbyn for hosting a Holocaust Memorial Day event during which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis.In 2016, she backed a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn by rebel Labour MPs.A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said last night the claim that he had called Dame Louise \u0027the MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027a fabrication\u0027.The disclosure of Mr Corbyn\u0027s role at the 2012 pro-Palestine rally follows claims last week that he chaired a meeting in Parliament in 2010 in which a speaker compared Israel\u0027s actions to the Nazis.Video footage of the 2012 meeting hosted in Conway Hall, Holborn, London by the Palestine Solidary Campaign shows the poem Love Letters To Gaza being recited by an actress. It was reportedly applauded by Mr Corbyn. The poem refers to an attempt by an unofficial \u0027freedom\u0027 flotilla of ships to break the blockade imposed by Israel on the Gaza Strip in 2011.It includes the lines: \u0027It is not now the Nazi state but Israel that blocks the seas.It is not Auschwitz that stops the ship that carries hope and messages,But those that might have died there....The victims are now the torturers.\u0027Mr Corbyn was also highly critical of Israel in his speech at the meeting, which featured a backdrop comprising a map showing Palestine in place of Israel.Labour\u0027s anti-Semitism revolt grew last night as Emily Benn, granddaughter of late Left-winger Tony Benn, said the only way to solve Labour\u0027s anti-Semitic rift was to sack Mr Corbyn.His statement was \u0027utter rubbish\u0027, tweeted former Labour parliamentary candidate Ms Benn, niece of senior Labour MP Hilary Benn.          \u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country,\u0027 said Dame Louise Ellman of Corbyn\u0027s comment\u0027No responsibility taken for the anti-Semitism and those anti-Semites he has supported for years. Labour has become an institutionally anti-Semitic Party under Jeremy Corbyn. It will not change while he is leader.\u0027 Dame Louise said last night: \u0027If this is correct, I am appalled that a potential Prime Minister would use language of this sort against one of his own MPs.\u0027To refer to me as the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 is to challenge my loyalty to this country.\u0027A key part the internationally accepted code on anti-Semitism which the Labour Party wants to dilute specifically states it is anti-Semitic to accuse Jews of being more loyal to Israel than to their own country.\u0027A Labour spokesman said last night that the allegation that Mr Corbyn had called Dame Louise the \u0027MP for Tel Aviv\u0027 was \u0027entirely untrue\u0027.

Both methods have been used to erode the green belt, the report said. Between 201112 and 201617 nearly 4,900 hectares of green belt have lost their protected status in local plans – the equivalent of a city the size of Middlesbrough, housing ministry figures show.The report said that in the past four years, 11,000 hectares of green belt land – a city the size of Bristol – have also been built on for industrial, commercial or residential purposes. Of this 7,200 were undeveloped ‘greenfield’ land.Last year alone the equivalent of nearly 400 football pitches of untouched greenfield were built on for flats or houses in England.Silent killer dubbed \u0027the new asbestos\u0027 threatens thousands...Share this articleThe pace of development in the green belt is accelerating. Only 70 houses or flats were built in the green belt in 200910 compared with 8,143 in 201718. Of these, 3,300 were on greenfield sites.Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt.’Virgin greenfield land is preferred by developers as it is easy to build on. But the CPRE said there was no need to pave over the countryside when there are sufficient urban ‘brownfield’ sites in towns and cities that could provide some 720,000 homes.Brownfield sites include wasteland, derelict or disused sites such as old warehouses or factories.The CPRE said that over the past six years ‘too many local authorities and developers have been taking a lax view of what exceptional means... allocating green belt sites for development as an easy option rather than as a last resort.’          Today’s CPRE report, The State of the Green Belt, said: ‘Our key findings show that the Government has broken its promise to secure the green belt\u0027 (Protesters in Borehamwood campaigning against development on green belt land)The CPRE also calculated that of the homes built on the green belt in the past nine years, 72 per cent were not ‘affordable’ under the Government’s definitions, so they do little to reduce the housing shortage.Critics fear it may become even easier to build on green belt land.Last year the Government unveiled its Housing White Paper containing ambitious plans to build a million new homes by 2020. It said the green belt would not lose any of its protections. But critics noted ‘exceptional circumstances’ could include housing requirements – in effect watering down safeguards.Tom Fyans, of the CPRE, said: ‘We are being sold a lie by many developers. As they sell off and gobble up the green belt to build low-density, unaffordable housing, young families go on struggling to afford a place to live.‘The affordable housing crisis must be addressed with increasing urgency, while acknowledging that far from providing the solution, building on the green belt only serves to entrench the issue. The Government is failing in its commitment to protect the green belt – it is being eroded at an alarming rate.’The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ‘We are clear building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside.‘Last year the number of new homes built was the highest in a decade, and only 0.02 per cent of the green belt was developed for residential use.‘We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt.’   We\u0027re fighting to half houses here... public services just cannot copeby Sami QuadriHundreds of residents have launched a campaign to stop new houses and a school being built on green belt land near their homes.They have taken to the streets with placards and chanted ‘Hands off green belt!’ in a demonstration against the development that would bring 58 houses and a primary school.

Jewish community leaders have demanded the party incorporate all 11 examples.          It comes after Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (pictured) warned the party faces being lost in a \u0027vortex of eternal shame\u0027 unless it addresses the concerns of the Jewish communityYesterday, in a new video, Mr Corbyn said driving out anti-Semitism and working with the Jewish community were ‘vital priorities’.He apologised for the hurt caused by the crisis, but made no mention, for example, of his decision to host an event in Parliament where Israel was compared to the Nazis. He was also filmed at a rally in 2010 comparing the plight of the Palestinians with those who suffered the Nazi sieges of Leningrad and Stalingrad.Last night Labour Friends of Israel said Mr Corbyn’s words would continue to lack credibility so long as he refused to apologise ‘for the many occasions on which he himself has offended the Jewish community’. Gideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said: ‘It is just another contradictory, hypocritical, insincere attempt to whitewash his own role as the author of this nightmare.’Tal Ofer, member of the Board of Deputies, tweeted: ‘You had three years, you did nothing. Time to go.’ Karen Pollock, of the Holocaust Education Trust, said: ‘False equivocations, denial and distortion of the Holocaust are incorrect, inappropriate, hurtful and wrong. Why in 2018 do we still find ourselves having to explain the offence this causes to not only Holocaust survivors, but to the Jewish community? To do it once is a mistake, twice perhaps careless, but multiple times?

Gynaecology specialist Dr Safaa Ismail (left) and her husband consultant neurosurgeon Hussien Al-Maghraby (right) are alleged to have paid Miss Hemdan only £400 in five months of work after hiring her to look after their four-year-old son in 2011In addition to free board at the couple\u0027s home, she was supposed to be paid £200 per month for working eight hours per day, six days per week. Miss Hemdan claims the payments stopped after two months, earning only £400. This means she was paid less than 50p an hour for five months of work, based on a 45-hour work week.  At one point in August when she complained about the alleged conditions, Dr Safaa became \u0027furious\u0027, it is claimed.In her witness statement, Miss Hemdan said: \u0027Dr Safaa became furious and began to shout at Miss Hemdan, as she did so pushing her up the stairs.\u0027Miss Hemdan was then locked in one of the bedrooms.\u0027Miss Hemdan was told that she could come out when she apologised.\u0027She was instructed to remain in her room and did so for two days before being allowed out of the room.\u0027Miss Hemdan told the tribunal: \u0027I was in my room for two days and no one brought me any food or water.\u0027I was too frightened to leave the room as I was scared of Dr Safaa. I was able to drink water from the sink in the bathroom.\u0027She added: \u0027I was treated as a servant and often told that I was a servant.\u0027The nanny alleged to the tribunal Dr Safaa was responsible for much of the treatment.She once told Miss Hemdan \u0027that she had girls working for her before and that if they didn\u0027t like things then she sold them on\u0027, it is alleged.          Miss Hemdan said she was fed leftovers and when she complained, was locked in a bedroom  with no food and had to drink from a tap in the bathroom. She also claimed they took her passport from her and made veiled threats to sell her.

I did not know what to say.\u0027Dr Safaa waited a moment and then asked me what did I think about that? I answered that if someone would do it, it would be a human and good thing to do.\u0027Dr Safaa replied: \u0027\u0027Are you willing?\u0027\u0027. I said no, that I was talking in general, not about my own kidney.\u0027Dr Safaa said that she could get me £25,000 if I agreed to give \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 my kidney.\u0027I believe that when she said \u0027\u0027us\u0027\u0027 she meant her and the bank manager.\u0027I said no, I could not possibly do this.

In that fight, al-Qaeda is effectively on the same side as the coalition - and, by extension, the United States.The U.S. has sent the coalition billions of dollars in weapons to fight the Houthis, and American jets provide air-to-air refueling for coalition war planes. The U.S. does not fund the coalition, however, and there is no evidence that American money went to AQAP militants.          The Saudi led coalition has claimed \u0027again and again\u0027 to have made decisive victories over the past two years, forcing militants to abandon their strongholds in the war-torn country. Pictured: A coalition fighter helps an injured man during  military operation last year\u0027Elements of the U.S. military are clearly aware that much of what the U.S. is doing in Yemen is aiding AQAP and there is much angst about that,\u0027 said Michael Horton, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, a U.S. analysis group that tracks terrorism.But supporting allies against \u0027what the U.S. views as Iranian expansionism takes priority over battling AQAP and even stabilizing Yemen,\u0027 Horton said.The AP found that coalition-funded militia commanders actively recruit al-Qaeda militants - considered to be exceptional fighters - or fighters who until very recently were members of the group.Abdel-Sattar al-Shamiri, a former adviser to the governor of Taiz province, said he recognized al-Qaeda\u0027s presence from the start and told commanders not to recruit members.\u0027Their response was, `We will unite with the devil in the face of Houthis,\u0027\u0027 al-Shamiri said.A militia commander in Taiz, known as Aboul Abbas, was put on the U.S. terrorism list for al-Qaeda ties last year. But he continues to receive money from the UAE for his militia, his aide Adel al-Ezzi told the AP. Al-Ezzi rejected the U.S. accusation, denying any terrorism links. Soon after his comments, the AP saw him meeting with a known AQAP commander.Another Taiz commander - Adnan Rouzek, who was recently given $12 million by Yemen\u0027s president for his fighting force - has a known al-Qaeda figure as his closest aide.The U.S. is aware of an al-Qaeda presence among anti-Houthi ranks, a senior American official told reporters in Cairo earlier this year. Because coalition members back militias with hard-line Islamic commanders, \u0027it\u0027s very, very easy for al-Qaeda to insinuate itself into the mix,\u0027 the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under the briefing\u0027s terms.          An explosion raises a cloud as coalition-backed fighters advance on the Red Sea port town of Mocha in Yemen in 2017The Pentagon denied any complicity with al-Qaeda.\u0027Since the beginning of 2017, we have conducted more than 140 strikes to remove key AQAP leaders and disrupt its ability to use ungoverned spaces to recruit, train and plan operations against the U.S. and our partners across the region,\u0027 spokesman Navy Cmdr. Sean Robertson said in an email.\u0027Our regional partners have a proven track record of aggressively pursuing terrorist organizations and denying them safe haven in Yemen and DOD does not have any reason to doubt their resolve,\u0027 he wrote.The Saudi-led coalition commented by saying it \u0027continues its commitment to combat extremism and terrorism.\u0027The UAE did not respond to repeated requests for comment.In early 2016, al-Qaeda pulled out of the southern port city of Mukalla and seven areas in the nearby Abyan province, under deals reached with the UAE, according to five military, security and government officials and four tribal mediators involved in the Abyan arrangement.That agreement included a provision that 10,000 local tribesmen - including 250 al-Qaeda militants - would be incorporated into the Security Belt, the UAE-backed Yemeni force in the area, an al-Qaeda negotiator and two Security Belt commanders said.An accord for the withdrawal in February from the town of al-Said in Shabwa province went further, the AP found. The coalition promised payments to al-Qaeda members who left, according to Shabwa\u0027s security chief Awad al-Dahboul, a mediator and two government officials.Al-Dahboul said about 200 al-Qaeda members received payments. He did not know the exact amounts, but said 100,000 Saudi rials ($26,000) were handed over to one al-Qaeda leader in the presence of Emirati commanders.Thousands of tribal fighters, including AQAP members, also were to be taken into the UAE-funded Shabwa Elite militia, the mediator and two officials said.Al-Shamiri, the former official from Taiz, warned that the militants will be difficult to uproot after filtering into such roles. \u0027We will get rid of Houthis and we will be struck with terrorist groups.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c62b29cdf93ca2b781738dc20be18d70abda161/0_0_663_435/master/663.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc17ca9114b70d64d68cae2f1a07879a 880w","title":"outcry sky news australia interview far right extremist blair cottrell","story":"News channel asks United Patriots Front’s Blair Cottrell about his view on immigrationSky News has sparked outcry in Australia after it broadcast an interview with Blair Cottrell, a far-right extremist who has expressed his admiration for Hitler.The channel hosted Cottrell in its Australian studios for a one-on-one discussion about immigration on Sunday night. Sky tweeted three videos of Cottrell arguing for immigration based on race, and live-tweeted his ideas.The leader of the United Patriots Front, a far-right nationalist group, has a criminal history which includes being found guilty last year of inciting contempt, revulsion or ridicule of Muslims. The bodybuilder and carpenter has also claimed to have manipulated women “using violence and terror”.The broadcast led a former Labor minister, Craig Emerson, to quit as a Sky commentator. “My father fought Nazis in WWII and was interred in a German POW camp,” he tweeted. The decision to put Cottrell on Sky News was “another step in a journey to normalising racism and bigotry in our country,” Emerson said.Hours later the channel said it was “wrong” to air the interview, but did not apologise. After complaints on Twitter, Sky removed all the tweets about Cottrell.David Shoebridge, a Greens party MP, said he would refuse all offers to go on Sky “until it gives a full apology and clear commitment to never again air this man’s hateful views”. He called on all MPs to follow his lead.Sky News’s political editor, David Speers, said on Twitter the outrage was “understandable” and agreed with Laura Jayes, a Sky political reporter, who called Cottrell a “fascist” and an “arsehole”.Cottrell had been invited to appear by the Sky News host and former Northern Territory chief minister Adam Giles, who asked him what he thought about Donald Trump’s ideas and the mix of immigration in Australia.“What we lack in this country is national pride ... that is necessary to galvanise the minds of the masses and to protect the people of this country against foreign ideologies,” Cottrell said. “If we can rebuild or reclaim our traditional identity as Australians then we may not need a Donald Trump, we may be able to fix the situation ourselves.”He told Giles that Australia should accept only skilled migrants. He advocated taking all the white farmers from South Africa and stopping immigration from the rest of the world.In 2015, Cottrell and two other members of the far-right group staged a mock beheading outside council offices in Bendigo, Victoria, to protest against the building of a mosque. They posted the video on Facebook.In a statement released on Monday, the chief executive of Australian News Channel, which owns Sky News in Australia, said the Adam Giles Show had been put on hold and that the format and structure of the program was under review. “We deeply regret featuring the interview on our channel,” Angelos Frangopoulos said. “It was an error of judgment and we have taken action to ensure our standards, which we are proud of, are maintained.”Cottrell would not be allowed back on the channel, Frangopoulos added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a36275dfabe88911ab29a11c3dab4cc122c98c4/219_156_2979_1787/master/2979.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=410d68e40b3b8c98813f5246b4609379","title":"standing desks could increase life expectancy study finds","story":"Researchers say sit-stand desks a cost-effective way to improve workforce’s health The introduction of sit-stand desks is a cost-effective way for employers to improve the health of their workforce, an Australian study has found.More than 230 desk-based workers took part in the Deakin University research to get them to stand, sit less and move more.Yet it would save 7,492 “health-adjusted life years” in prevention of obesity-related diseases, states the article published in the Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health. The research was funded by VicHealth and the National Health and Medical Research Council.Lead researcher Dr Lan Gao from Deakin said spending excessive amounts of time sitting at a desk was associated with serious diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It could also be a factor in reduced life expectancy.“Adopting this workplace intervention also has the potential to reduce absenteeism and improve productivity,” Gao said. “The introduction of sit-stand desks, alongside associated supports, is a cost-effective and innovative way to promote the health of Australia’s workforce.”The study found the net cost of providing workers with sit-stand desks was about at $344 per person, but Dr Gao said this could be reduced by economies of scale with bulk orders and sharing workstations. “Ultimately this intervention has the potential to make a very significant and sustainable positive impact on reducing workplace sitting time, but most importantly it is also cost-effective, which we know is critical in making the case for a wider rollout of this program,” she said.Official advice from the National Health and Medical Research council says sedentary behaviour is associated with poorer health outcome.“There is currently not enough evidence to make a recommendation on the specific duration of sitting or lying down that is associated with poorer health outcomes. However, it is recommended to break up time spent sitting or lying down, as often as possible.”It also warns that the emerging evidence suggests that the ill-effects of sedentary behaviour cannot be overcome by exercise.Other studies have cast doubt on the health benefits of sit-stand work stations.Researchers at Exeter University in the UK and University College London followed more than 5,000 people over a 16-year period and found sitting down was no worse for you than standing up as long as you had regular exercise. “Any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing,” said Melvyn Hillsdon from Exeter’s sport and health sciences department.“The results cast doubt on the benefits of sit-stand work stations, which employers are increasingly providing to promote healthy working environments.”The research found there was no influence on mortality risk for participants from sitting at work, during leisure time or watching television."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1396dc2c0595874e7f0a31d46dd913ed244773/0_0_4480_2987/master/4480.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ca2b82f136ff89abd2219e78a74d54 660w","title":"bame short story prize shortlist ranges across modern life","story":"The six finalists for the Fourth Estate award offer compelling pictures of the contemporary worldFrom the Yangtze river to Ladbroke Grove, the six stories shortlisted for the  and Fourth Estate BAME short story prize offer a whistlestop tour of the contemporary world, taking in environmental disaster and the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower blaze.Three hundred stories were submitted for the prize for work by black and minority ethnic writers, which is now in its third year. Former shortlistees include Guy Gunaratne, whose debut novel In Our Mad and Furious City was last week longlisted for the Man Booker prize.In her story Spam, Manchester-born Savannah Burney brings a keen comic sensibility to the the redemptive story of an encounter between a grouchy B\u0026ampB owner – with a lifelong spam sandwich habit – and a young girl made homeless by the Grenfell fire, who cannot decide if Pot Noodles are halal.

Jason Deelchand’s Something Buried in the Ground spins a chilling fable of environmental betrayal around a girl and her storytelling father.But there is room for more whimsical worldviews. In Gurnaik Johal’s The Piano, an elderly widower takes a creative approach to grief by leaving his dead wife’s piano out on the street for young lovers to play. In Bus Stop, the writer and editor Varaidzo centres a surreal coming-of-age story on an adolescent whose uncertainties about gender and identity spin her off into a parallel world.Fourth Estate commissioning editor Anna Kelly, who chairs the judging panel, said that all six were “really exciting and compelling new voices who stood out from the rest and I’m looking forward to seeing their careers progress over the coming years.

Burney imagines her characters brilliantly and her story stood out for its humour and warmth.Sarah Shaffi on Something Buried in the Ground by Jason DeelchandSomething Buried in the Ground is a beautiful, evocative piece of writing that combines the story of an environmental disaster with folklore and history. I loved the sense of place, and the way it evoked strong emotional reactions. Deelchand is a writer to watch.Alex Reads on City of Culture by Kit FanCity of Culture is a fantastic story – so poignant, visceral and beautifully crafted that it has no choice but to makes you remember what it means to lose someone close to you. To lose the power to speak, to not be able to find the words to articulate yourself, at a time when so much is required of you. Fan expertly writes in the voice of a teenage girl, and I look forward to his further writings. Anna Kelly on The Piano by Gurnaik JohalA moving, tender story about grief, loneliness and community, The Piano explores how people’s lives are interconnected and intertwined.

Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data.Scandinavian Airlines was the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule. Aer Lingus has the second-best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines.The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: “A number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network.”She said disruption was also caused by “particularly severe winter weather” and that the airline was taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays.Norwegian Air Shuttle’s UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of the airline’s long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary.A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather “invariably impact punctuality” and are beyond airlines’ control.“We do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible,” he said. “Norwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers.”The CAA said punctuality “clearly matters to airline passengers” and that it published data on carriers’ performance to allow people to “make informed choices about which airline to fly with”.Dale Keller, the chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays were “extremely costly” to carriers, and that airlines are “fully engaged” with governments, ATC providers and airports to minimise causes of disruption outside their control.Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption. When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, and hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are “extraordinary circumstances” such as severe weather or a security alert. Payouts range from €250 (£223) to €600 depending on the length of the flight and how long it was delayed.The editor of Which? Travel magazine, Rory Boland, advised delayed passengers to “make sure you make a claim for the compensation that you are entitled to”.“Airlines now need to do the right thing and introduce automatic compensation. Passengers should not have to jump through hoops to claim back the money they are owed,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4440d1e9e1d46e185481b81630fdd5f838eecce4/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a711941349187697bff2f5bbc262242d","title":"five years ago there was nothing inside duqm the city rising from the sand oman city sand luxury hotels housing","story":"Oman’s sparsely inhabited coast of fishing villages and Bedouin camps is being transformed into industrial city with port, luxury hotels and housing for 111,000by  Wade Shepard in Duqm“Five years ago there was nothing here,” says Hamad Said Al Rawahi as he drives fast along a stretch of freshly paved highway in Oman’s coastal desert. He just picked me up from the side of the road in his shiny black Mercedes. I am hitchhiking – the closest thing to public transport out here.We are in Duqm, a nascent city about 300 miles (480km) from the capital, Muscat, that was a fishing village prior to 2011, when Oman reimagined it, along with a stretch of uninterrupted coastline and Bedouin camps, as a new special economic zone.“It has totally changed,” says Al Rawahi, who has lived in Duqm “for a few years” and works at its dry dock. “Now we have five-star hotels and villas … There are shops and supermarkets, places you can go and visit.”The city is still in its early days. The basic highway grid has just been paved, the port and dry dock have recently begun operating, the oil refinery is getting set to fire up, and two luxury hotels have opened their doors. Within two years an estimated 111,000 people are expected to call this place home.The masterplan for Duqm follows the guidelines of transit-oriented development virtually step by step. A sea port is being used to seed a vast special economic zone, which in turn is being used as an economic driver for the entirely new metropolis. The full gamut of urban offerings will be built in Duqm: industrial zones, a large refinery, a new airport, education centres, sprawling thickets of modern housing and a tourism district. The idea is that the various projects will act in symbiosis: traffic at the port will drive demand for industries in the special economic zone, these industries will create a need for housing for employees and investors, and this new population will want entertainment, shops, schools and healthcare. In theory, at least.The masterplanned nature of Duqm is also intended to allow for a more liberalised economic environment that could spark more private industry, create new types of jobs, and attract foreign investment – while tempting Omanis away from Muscat.Globally, Duqm is no anomaly. We are in the midst of an era of new cities – with more than 200 currently under construction. Remote deserts all over east Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa are being urbanised. There’s Nurkent in Kazakhstan, Aylat in Azerbaijan, New Kabul City in Afghanistan, New Baghdad in Iraq, Rawabi in Palestine, King Abdullah Economic City in Saudi Arabia, New Cairo in Egypt … Morocco has nine new cities in the works, and Kuwait has 12.While differing in scale and complexity, most of these new cities are designed to meet similar goals: to reshape their economies and to rebrand their countries as technologically advanced and economically sustainable, as sleek, modern and international.The International Monetary Fund predicted in 2016 that Oman could be one of a host of oil-dependent Middle Eastern countries that could run out of money before the end of the decade. Coming alongside shocks such as the 2014 oil price crash, the message of ersification was driven home.The government of Oman responded by decreeing that the hydrocarbon-derived share of its GDP will be halved by 2020 . To this end, $106bn (£81bn) was earmarked to develop tourism, transport and real estate sectors – and efforts to bring projects like Duqm to fruition were doubled down.“Several dozen new cities are being constructed in the Middle East, mainly to transition away from the petroleum industry to a variety of other industries, including tourism, manufacturing, education and hi-tech,” says Dr Sarah Moser, a McGill University geography professor and author of an upcoming atlas of new cities. “Many oil-producing states in the Middle East are eager to globalise their economies and attract international investors, particularly in anticipation of a post-oil world. New cities are a way to jumpstart this economic transition, and are also seen as a way to start fresh and avoid the entrenched corruption, bureaucracy and political entanglements of existing cities.”Duqm sits on the Arabian Sea near the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf – and the world’s most glaring oil supply chokepoint. Nearly a fifth of the world’s oil currently flows through this passage, ever prone to disruption. If the Duqm project succeeds, the shipping industry would be able to dock at the gates of the Middle East without needing to go all the way inside.It is this strategic position that has attracted the attention of Beijing’s much heralded Maritime Silk Road. More than three-quarters of Oman’s crude oil exports go directly to China.Last year, Oman Wanfang – a consortium of private Chinese companies – staked a $10.7bn 11 sq km claim in Duqm’s special economic zone. The consortium pragmatically dubbed their section of Duqm the Sino-Oman Industrial City and has plans to build an oil refinery, a methanol plant, a solar power equipment production facility, an automobile factory, a building materials plant, a $200m five-star tourism zone and enough homes to support a population of 25,000 in the area.While the money for this endeavour is not officially coming from the Chinese government, Oman Wanfang clearly has the full political support of Beijing, including approval from the National Development and Reform Commission, which has declared it a “top overseas industrial park”. This high-level political support has greased the path for other Chinese economic adventures in Oman, such as the $3.6bn behemoth of a loan presented to Muscat last year.Other nations have invested in Duqm too, including Kuwait, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, and in February it was announced that India would be given access to the port and dry dock for commercial and military purposes.While Duqm was never very densely populated, around 3,000 Bedouin – mostly fishermen and semi-nomadic herders – called the area home before the bulldozers arrived.These villages have now been demolished and the Oman government has built a new, modern town for them to relocate to. The houses look as if they were copied and pasted from Muscat – bright, white buildings two storeys high with garages and ornate gateways. There is a mosque in the centre. The houses stand empty. The local Bedouin prefer their traditional way of life – and want space to keep camels.“They don’t want to stay in the accommodation provided by the state because they find it very unnatural,” says Prasad. “But modernity has to catch up with them … whether they like it or not.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd04a4b667831e40c0137e09faf9ed636461f0fd/0_297_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c49c4d4012b55d698e44d076263d549","title":"planning system uk landscapes listing rural britain","story":"Government housing policy has lost all contact with planning Britain’s countryside.

Already, unplanned and sprawling “toy-town” estates are spreading across the home counties, the Fens, the Somerset Levels and the Severn Valley. It has sucked development into the south-east of England, denuded town centres and put ever more pressure on transport corridors. It is the worst sort of “non-planning”.Local planning must be restored. The government claims the right to decide how many new people come to Britain. It should grant local people the same right, to control the pace and nature of settlement in their communities. New planning rules deny them that right. They dictate that, should local people fight imposed targets, they will lose any further say in the matter, allowing free rein to development. It is heads we win, tails you lose localism.Britain’s reputation for town-and-country planning has all but evaporated over the past decade. Each change in planning rules, usually dictated by the building lobby, has drawn ever more of the countryside into speculative play. The solution does not lie in arguing over a few hundred green-belt acres and a few thousand subsidised houses. County land-use planning has to be restored. Landscape considered worthy of long-term preservation – and much of it is still outside national parks – should be “listed” for its scenic and environmental value, like conservation areas in towns. Other land could then be declared a potentially developable land bank.Listing the landscape would replace the present fighting with proper planning. Everyone would know where they stood. Rural Britain would not, as now, be up for speculative land grab. The old mistakes would not be repeated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/852853ba718ff57428612973104408473fc5c43d/0_129_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65543c1c43ec2dacf915f723fd4e20b6","title":"proust truly long read stories","story":"Short hits might seem preferable to vast narratives, but stories that take time to absorb offer special pleasuresAnother summer, and another assault on the unscaled mountains of literature. Having woefully failed at 2017’s attempt on Henry James, who fell foul of a sudden addiction to his sleuthier cousin PD, I’m once again preparing to tackle Proust, courtesy of a 50th birthday present of a beautiful boxed set of In Search of Lost Time. Thank God I shan’t be doing it alone, but in the company of novelist Susan Hill, who explained in last week’s Spectator Diary that, having got so far and no further on multiple previous occasions, she too was going back in. She is now on Book 5, and I salute her.Perhaps if we succeed, we can meet up, together with other Marcel completists, and debate the merits of the essay by Perry Anderson that recently featured in the London Review of Books. Anderson argued, at some length, that we should regard Anthony Powell, the author of the 12-volume novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, in a kindly light, possibly even kindlier than that we reserve for Proust’s magnum opus.The argument for Powell can be crudely summarised as an argument for the close, but crucially detached, observation of what Anderson called, way back in 1984, “the greatest fictional representation” of “the last true leisure-class in metropolitan history”. Powell’s narrator, Nick Jenkins, goes to a lot of parties Proust’s, not so much. Where Proust wove magical sentences around his alter ego’s profound interiority, Powell abandoned his to the cut and thrust of the elite’s social and political lives. What he was aiming for, wrote Christopher Hitchens in 1998, was “the harnessing of counterpoint” he also quoted VS Pritchett’s description of Powell as “a Proust Englished by Wodehouse”.Pritchett, unsurprisingly, was on to something there: not merely that Powell had a talent for spotting the jocular side to human, class-based interaction, but also that it led him to a particularly fruitful blend of humour and satire. Nobody who has followed the adventures of Kenneth Widmerpool – a humourless, pompous man on the make who goes from Labour MP to member of a cult – could doubt it.But whether you are in #TeamProust or #TeamPowell, it might seem the time is right to question whether these long, fictional trajectories are, themselves, now a part of Lost Time. When the Man Booker prize judges announced their longlist of the 13 novels in contention for this year’s £50,000 prize, much was made of the inclusion of types of book not previously recognised by the award – notably the graphic novel and the thriller, in this case Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina and Belinda Bauer’s Snap respectively. It was a sign, perhaps, that the hegemony of the conventional narrative – a story with a beginning, a middle and an end, told in a roughly recognisable “literary” style – was waning, and that the arbiters of what was good and worthwhile in contemporary fiction were starting to loosen their stays. There was a novel in verse, Robin Robertson’s The Long Take a multi-vocal e into London life, Guy Gunaratne’s In Our Mad and Furious City and a terrifying, gendered dystopia, Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure.And of course, the last three winners of the prize – Marlon James, Paul Beatty and George Saunders – stake a large claim to the idea that traditional narratives are no longer holding sway when it comes to handing out the cheques Saunders’s Lincoln in the Bardo, in which dozens of the newly dead congregate in the afterlife to discuss the fate of Abraham Lincoln’s deceased son, is a masterclass in bewildering, and then beguiling, readers.As culture, politics and social life appear to fracture and atomise, and find representation in short, sharp hits of writing – Olivia Laing’s Crudo, for example, both set and written in seven weeks last summer, or Ali Smith’s against-the-clock quartet of novels – does a place remain for the long sequence, written over many years, filled with recurring characters, looping themes, patterns that emerge only in retrospect?Happily, yes. Take Alan Hollinghust, for example, whose technique of progressing the story in blocks of time, with unchronicled years between them, worked to vivid effect in his most recent novel, The Sparsholt Affair. Others eschew the strict parameters of the series – each novel following on from the previous in obvious chronology – by creating works that bear a strong family resemblance, and which, taken together, seem like attempts on the summit via different routes.Amanda Craig’s novels, Hearts and Minds and The Lie of the Land, take the nation’s pulse with wit and insight, and she is now deep into the next instalment. Jonathan\u0026nbspCoe’s new book, Middle England, will be published this November, a quarter of a century after What a Carve Up! appeared, melding a very British love of comic B-movie culture with a panoramic view of the tyranny and loathsomeness of the ruling classes. This after a series of ambitious assaults on the establishment. His last novel, Number Eleven, managed to combine both the passage of time with painfully acute swipes at the idiocies and venalities of contemporary culture (you might never watch I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here! in quite the same benign light again). So the purveyors of the longue durée are still in business, just over 100 years after the first instalment of In Search of Lost Time. I’ll do my best with Proust this summer. But the best news for\u0026nbsplovers of fiction is that we don’t have to choose\u0026nbspbetween the long view or the short run-up we can have them both.• Alex Clark writes for the  and the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82592fe9a6f09bb07c6b37f01d0e83677de12998/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b372698893343097ba222137aed78","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club. But the key thing for her is to keep showing her daughter there’s no such thing as a sport girls can’t do.“I’ve never wanted my daughter to think that certain things are only for girls, and that certain things are only for boys,” she says. “There shouldn’t be any limitations for anything.” In 2017 one of the key elements of Natwest’s partnership with the ECB was to help raise funding to open up even more opportunities for young people, both male and female, to enjoy cricket. This will continue in 2018.As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

During his workshop, at St Edmund Campion Catholic School near Birmingham, he tells a group of children how he was expelled from school for stabbing a schoolmate with a screwdriver – and how, as a teenager, he spent years running with gangs, carrying guns and knives, and dealing drugs.The urban youth specialist stares into the eyes of each member of his audience in turn as he explains what it was like to serve time in 11 different prisons. He tells the children, some as young as 12, about a friend who was stabbed to death 16 years ago: “I buried him.” He talks about a different friend who is in prison for life. “He asked me to tell you not to repeat his mistakes,” he says.His 12-week Crime Awareness Programme aims to take young people who have been identified as being at risk of exclusion from school, or falling foul of the law, and engage them in a positive activity to help them understand the risks and consequences of criminal behaviour.Provided in four West Midlands schools, the programme is backed by Chance to Shine, a charity that brings cricket to thousands of young people in inner-city areas. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine uses the sport to encourage social cohesion and steer youngsters away from antisocial behaviour and crime.His programme pulls no punches. With the help of some hard-hitting videos, he explains how some teenagers have even been sent to prison for life because they were part of a gang from which a different member murdered someone – known as “joint enterprise” prosecutions.Having delivered his wake-up call, he leads the children out into the sunshine to play cricket. With the composed, avuncular authority of a natural, he gathers them into a pre-game huddle and then encourages from the sidelines as they play in the sun. From the darkness and danger of gang life to the lightness and laughter of team spirit, it’s a powerful package.The youngsters play tape-ball cricket – a simple, inclusive and fun version of the game that uses plastic bats and a tennis ball wrapped in electrical tape. The six-a-side sessions last about 20 minutes.Sam says the contrast between the workshops and the cricket games is crucial. “The information in the workshops can be really hard-hitting, and in some cases the kids will have had similar things happen to friends or family members, so it might be a bit heavy for some iniduals,” he explains.“The cricket really lightens it up. It’s a great way to engage with them, to get them into teamwork and for them to come out of their comfort zone.”Sam says cricket is a “perfect game” for his mission, because it discourages star treatment. “In life, there is always going to be one boy or girl who is more charismatic, or more popular, and others who are more shy.“I want to give the shy iniduals a chance to shine, and encourage the more popular ones to tone it down a little bit. When we play cricket, we’re all on the same footing. It encourages teamwork and communication skills.”He has thought carefully about every aspect of his programme, right down to what he wears. “I need them to listen to me so I immerse myself in their culture,” he says. “The way I dress for these days, even my choice of trainers, is geared to show them that I understand what’s going on their lives.”His classroom vocabulary mirrors this. When he challenges one pupil for not paying attention, he tells them: “You’re not listening – you’re on some switch-off ting.”His energy is high throughout. “Kids who are in trouble are usually perpetually in fight-or-flight mode – their energy is different to other kids’, so I need to meet them where they are,” he says, bouncing from one foot to the other.One of the pupils, a 13-year-old boy, says he always thought cricket was “boring” but that he’s come to love it. “Before I started these workshops I was always in trouble and getting detentions, but now I’m not getting in any trouble. Cricket has really helped me.”A 16-year-old girl agrees, saying her friends have told her that they’ve seen a “really positive change” in her since she started the programme.She says Sam’s frankness about his own past makes it easier for her to trust him. “He’s taught me that life can be really dangerous, or really straightforward. It depends on which path you take.”One 12-year-old boy adds that the cricket sessions with Sam are his favourite part of school, and that he looks forward to them all week. “Tanayah’s my hero,” he smiles.Sam is proud of the effect his work is having. “To take kids who were on the road to being excluded from school and see them staying on to complete their GCSEs is amazing,” he says. “Statistics show that once a child is excluded, the chances of them going to prison are increased.”Surveys conducted at the beginning and end of a previous 12-week programme found the vast majority of those taking part experienced a change of heart towards knife and gang crime. At the start of the programme, about a fifth of the youngsters agreed with the statement that being in a gang made them safer by the end, only one person felt that way. Of those who started with no strong feelings either way, most disagreed strongly by the end.As for Sam, he says he turned his own life around when he discovered the teachings of Islam. “They showed me to value life, to value the law of the land,” he says. “I feel like this is what I’m here to do. Once upon a time, I called people to evil. Now I call people to good.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

You might even think of boxing: the city is home to some of the sport’s greatest exponents, including recent former world champion Tony Bellew and former British and Commonwealth champion David Price.But few people would associate Liverpool with cricket.Chance to Shine, the sports charity whose mission is to “spread the power of cricket throughout schools and communities” is hoping to change that. With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

Its State of the Green Belt 2018 report reveals that the number of finished homes constructed on the protected areas almost doubled last year to about 8,000.The government has pledged to protect green belt land but housing campaigners believe much more controlled land could be released to build badly needed affordable new homes.The CRPE data, collated from various sources, came just weeks after the government’s revised national planning policy framework, issued last month after a consultation period in the spring. The new framework, released with a slew of other announcements just before the parliamentary recess, contained a number of crucial policy points.In the new policy, ministers overruled campaigners, parish councils and others who called for a blanket ban on building in the green belt, while also not agreeing to the further relaxation of the green belt rules sought by developers. The government concluded: “The restrictions on the location of housing in the green belt are in place to prevent gradual erosion of green belt boundaries over time and to maintain openness. The revised framework does however continue to make clear that plans may provide for limited affordable housing for local community needs.”The CPRE found that in 2017-18, more than 8,000 homes were built on the green belt, with 4,800 on brownfield sites and 3,300 on previously undeveloped land. That compares with more than 4,000 completions in 2016-17, of which fewer than 1,000 were on greenfield sites.Robert Colvile, the director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said the current system was flawed. “It is bizarre that greater London is surrounded by an area three times larger on which little can be built, irrespective of the quality of the land,” he said. “No one is calling for the green belt to be concreted over. But there is plenty of scope for judicious development, for example around transport hubs, while protecting the most beautiful countryside.”CPRE said the “exceptional circumstances” rules for green belt building should be strengthened to ensure any proposals for development must pass strict tests.The Green party called for a land value tax to encourage the use of vacant land. Currently, thousands of hectares of land that have been approved for homebuilding goes unused as the owners wait for values to increase rather than construct housing. A land value tax would penalise landowners who sit on land for which building permits have been issued.The party’s co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “Instead of overseeing the erosion of our green space, the government should invest in increasing social and affordable housing on the plentiful brownfield sites in our towns and cities, take action on empty homes, and introduce a land value tax to encourage the use of vacant land and reduce speculation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b2a4d62728a97303be619e5d879bdebb7c804a/104_19_1251_750/master/1251.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e32137296f96785a6f5ba09ab580307","title":"beyond woodstock why does cinema struggle to recreate the music festival","story":"From Terrence Malick’s Song to Song to Taking Woodstock, film-makers are often afraid of getting their hands dirty. That can’t be said, however, of new film The FestivalWhen it comes to music festivals, we tend to only remember the highs – so let new comedy The Festival remind you what you’re not missing. Partly filmed at last year’s Leeds festival, it is brought to you by the makers of The Inbetweeners movies and stars Joe Thomas, which should already give you a clue: long drops, mud, bodily fluids, crowds, anxiety, confusion. “I just want to go home, have a proper shower and a poo,” says Thomas in the trailer. This is the festival experience as it really is – somewhere between a dream trip and a prison sentence. But, so often, cinema fails to capture that spirit.You can see why the setting appeals to film-makers: spectacle, energy, youth, a cast of thousands – none of which you had to engineer yourself. But the key danger of using a music festival as a backdrop is that it is more interesting than the frontdrop. That has been the case with recent efforts such as last year’s Access All Areas, a well-intentioned “let’s run away to the festival” movie piggybacking off Bestival. Meanwhile, David “Hell Or High Water” Mackenzie gave us You Instead, which used the hokey device of handcuffing a guy and girl together at Scotland’s T in the Park for a day. Nevada’s famed Burning Man generally refuses film-makers permission to use it as a backdrop, but they made an exception for 2017’s The Girl from the Song, a sort of Orpheus and Eurydice reworking with Black Rock City as the underworld. Seeing the film felt “really weird”, said Burning Man’s organisers. It “confirmed our belief that Black Rock City just isn’t an appropriate place to shoot fiction films”. They promised never to let it happen again.Earlier generations recognised that the music was the story and there was no point competing. Classic 1960s rockumentaries make us feel as if we’re in the crowd, because that’s what the film-makers felt like, from DA Pennebaker’s Monterey Pop to the Maysles brothers’ Gimme Shelter and Michael Wadleigh’s Woodstock. The same could not be said for highbrow auteurs such as the elusive Terrence Malick, who broke cover for just long enough to film the likes of Michael Fassbender and Rooney Mara out at Austin’s City Limits festival for Song to Song. The film felt like an interminable guitar solo: long and dull. Even worse was Ang Lee, whose rightly forgotten Taking Woodstock managed to turn the greatest cultural moment of the late-20th century into a saga of events management. These were festival movies by people who had clearly never seen the inside of a long drop. At least that can’t be said of The Festival.So here are a few rules of thumb for making a festival film: stay safe, stay hydrated and, unless you’re prepared to get your hands dirty, stay at home. The Festival is in UK cinemas from 17 August"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e1bf949b3b66c3d7c442f97ede27b40dcac24ce/0_383_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f407d89013f5e472ebe2814a61b3907","title":"rachel roddy bruschetta recipe tomatoes","story":"Tart Roman tomatoes that are more green than red work brilliantly on garlic-rubbed toasts, with olive oil and saltThe hope was that the six tomatoes ripening on the plant on the terrace would be ready for this column. They are not. No home-grown bruschetta topping quite yet.What we gain, though, is a day or two more of the tomato watch that’s been going on every morning since the day – just after Easter – that my mum gave my son some seeds. He then filled a bin bag-lined supermarket basket with soil, poked the seeds in, then positioned it against the sunniest wall, under our upstairs neighbours’ constantly dripping air-conditioning unit. I’m not sure what I have enjoyed more: watching determined little shoots become plants and parents of six, or a determined six-year-old cheer them on with the same fist-clenched intent he cheers on AS Roma.Tomato watching, also tomato sniffing. What is it that makes tomato leaves and vines smell so utterly gorgeous? It’s the most vegetal, sappy and happy scent, although that is measuring it against three geranium plants, four clambering ringosperna, a gangly supermarket rosemary (forever traumatised by the move from plastic to real pot), a tub of unidentified but possibly edible weeds, a dying oleander, rampant caper and the toe-biting tortoise, all of which inhabit our dripping, sunny terrace.While we wait on our bumper crop, Filippo’s Testaccio market stall is now a sea of red and pink and green. It is the tomatoes on the green fringe that I have been enjoying most this year, a plum-shaped variety with skin the colour of cucumber flesh with pinky-red streaks. Filippo simply calls them casarecce – home grown. My friend, the cook and gardener Carla Tomasi, calls this particular variety insalatari – salad tomatoes. I remember the first time I was given a bruschetta with tomatoes that were more green than red, more crunch than flesh. It seemed all wrong: surely the point of tomatoes in this situation was that they squished and squashed, gave themselves over to the bruschetta? It was an unexpected lesson to learn that, if the tomatoes are good, flavourful and well-coated with olive oil (which catches salt), then green flesh with its snappy, acid crunch, piled on garlic-rubbed, oil-sodden toast is a pleasure. It is the same with insalata caprese, where slices of green-tinted and acidic tomato flesh make an ideal partner for milky mozzarella. Of course, red and ripe, or crisp and green, you decide on the best tomatoes for your bruschetta or your caprese ... just don’t forget the basil.When referring to English legs on an Italian beach, bruscate means “burned”. In relation to bread, it means toasted – hence bruschetta, or little toasts. Good bruschetta is made with bread that has a compact crumb – a dense, country-style loaf or, better still, Tuscan-style unsalted bread, ideally a day old so it has firmed up. Barbecues – presently playing their biggest role for years – are the ideal place to make bruschetta, but a grill, toaster or griddle pan works just as well (for those of you who have asked, ‘What will she write about next, making toast?’ I seem to be doing just that). By toasting bread and giving it a coarse texture, we turn it into a garlic catcher – cut a clove in half and rub the cut side on the rough surface – as you would washing on an old fashioned washing board – until it is as garlicky as you like. If you are making plain bruschetta, rub with garlic, sprinkle with salt and pour over olive while it is still hot.For bruschetta al pomodoro, chop one tomato per person into a bowl, rip in some basil (basil-sniffing is another summer sport), sprinkle with salt, add a good amount of oil and let it sit for a few minutes before piling as much of it as possible on garlic-rubbed toast. For courgette bruschetta, cut one courgette per person into 2mm slices longways, sear on a hot griddle pan until soft with embossed with char marks, then toss in a bowl with ripped basil, salt, olive oil and just a little red-wine or sherry vinegar, then pile on to the garlic-rubbed toast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54731634d8a6f7b408a1b0d82082f98631603f2d/0_47_4151_2491/master/4151.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd3c5e6109dd4d50811330c7dd428c3d","title":"premier league 2018 19 preview leicester","story":"Claude Puel is under pressure after inept performances at the end of last season and the departure of Mahrez writers’ predicted position: 9th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Doyle’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 250-1Many bookmakers list Claude Puel as the favourite to be the first Premier League manager out of the door this season, a ranking that could be taken as something else for José Mourinho to complain about. So when Leicester kick off the new season at Old Trafford on Friday, the stakes will be unusually high. That is not to say that either man is likely to be sacked after one game of this campaign but that both are under singular pressure to start this season well – especially Puel.The Leicester regime showed last year that they are not afraid to cut their manager loose if an ugly end to a season bleeds into the start of the next one (a variation on a previous theme, whereby Claudio Ranieri was cut loose after a historically wonderful climax gave way to a bloody ominous start). They severed ties with Craig Shakespeare after only five league matches last season, making no allowance for the fact that those games included meetings with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United. It was the right move. Persistent problems suggested no progress had been made nor would be. The lesson for Puel is that he needs his team to demonstrate quickly that they have become more comfortable with his methods than they appeared to be in the second half of last season, otherwise he could be invited to murmur his goodbyes and leave.If that suggestion does not come from the owners, then it could come from players and certainly from fans, many of whom spent the final few months of last season puzzling over or booing a team that produced a harrowing sequence of slow, flaccid, leaky and inept performances, their ninth-place finish truly damning of the riff-raff below.Leicester had initially impressed under Puel and shown signs that they were on course to develop into more than a counterattacking side, but then they lost their way and became less than the sum of their malfunctioning parts. Injuries did not help but nor did they explain fully why Jamie Vardy was so often isolated up front and the defence was porous, with Leicester conceding 60 goals in the campaign, more than relegated Swansea and West Brom. So, what has changed?Most obviously, Riyad Mahrez has left. That will not as damaging a blow as may be feared if the another Algerian international – Rachid Ghezzal, who joined from Monaco on Sunday for £12m – integrates quickly into Leicester and the Premier League. The 26-year-old winger can be thrillingly incisive when on form but has seldom been consistent in his career to date. He will not share the burden of replacing Mahrez’s creativity alone.Part of Puel’s brief is to renew Leicester’s team by blending in young players, which he has had a strong record of achieving throughout his career. Accordingly, Demarai Gray and Fousseni Diabaté can be confident of featuring more often than last season. There may even be times when both start in the event of the manager choosing to take Marc Albrighton off one wing. Irrespective of who plays on the flanks, Leicester’s chief creative duties look set to be performed by the youngster likely to be deployed centrally in Puel’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation: James Maddison.The 21-year-old signed from Norwich City in June after an outstanding season in the Championship has sparkled during pre-season as a central playmaker and looks to have all the technique and cleverness to knit together Leicester’s attacks and improve the service to Vardy. He will operate in a similar space to where the dwindling Shinji Okazaki used to revel, but in a different way as Leicester aim to play more with the ball. Leicester could come to rely heavily on Maddison, especially if Adrien Silva does not improve. That alludes to another key question: is Leicester’s squad both bloated and too thin?Certainly they have too many players – such as Leonardo Ulloa, Nampalys Mendy and Islam Slimani will probably not make the 25-man Premier League squad if they are still at the club when the transfer window closes but the quality of that squad will remain questionable if further signings are not made this week.Consider the centre of defence, for instance. Harry Maguire and Jonny Evans should prove an excellent partnership but, when they are unavailable – as is expected to be the case for the trip to Old Trafford, for starters – then Puel may feel obliged to turn to Wes Morgan and Yohan Benalouane. Morgan has been a terrific player and captain for the club but his best years are gone Benalouane, at 31, is younger and slightly more mobile than Morgan but erratic. Perhaps Puel will put his trust in emerging talent here, too, and give a start to 19-year-old Darnell Johnson, who has looked precociously accomplished during pre-season?The manager did something similar last season when he promoted Ben Chilwell to first-choice left-back ahead of Christian Fuchs. Chilwell contributed well to attacks but showed he had much to learn when it came to defending. At right-back, meanwhile, Puel has opted for a blue-chip solution, Leicester spending about £20m this summer to buy the Portuguese international Ricardo Pereira from Porto. A fast and exciting player who thrived under Puel when at Nice, Pereira should prove a fine recruit whose arrival pushes Danny Simpson to the fringes. But Leicester could still be an injury or suspension away from having to improvise by playing Daniel Amartey at right-back.At least Leicester have strength in depth in goal, where the arrival of Danny Ward from Liverpool reduces the dependency on Kasper Schmeichel, meaning that the unavailability or even departure of the Dane might not be ruinous. Meanwhile, even the dependency up front on Vardy might be lessened if 21-year-old Kelechi Iheanacho develops as hoped following a first season during which he looked limited, sharp but not dynamic. There are a lot of ifs as Leicester try to transition from their title-winning team to a fresher and more rounded outfit.At their strongest Leicester could boast an impressive-looking spine: Schmeichel in goal, Maguire and Evans in central defence, the splendid Wilfred Ndidi anchoring midfield, Maddison pulling strings and Vardy skinning defences. Around the edges may flit spry and nifty youngsters. Together they could form an attractive and formidable unit. That is the theory. But Puel was unable to get his players to put that into practice often enough last season and towards the end some seemed to have tuned out. If the manager succeeds in inspiring better performances following a few good summer additions and more time with his squad (the interruption of the World Cup notwithstanding) – and despite the loss of Mahrez – then he will deserve high praise. But the way Leicester limped through the final months of last season means that, if there is little evidence of improvement in the opening months of this season, Puel may be asked to take a hike.

Like everything else, in their homes or on their bodies, the firewood has succumbed to the inescapable rainy season. With the wet weather comes uncertainty: where to find food, as well as the threat of floods, landslides and cyclones. “We’ve struggled a lot during this monsoon,” says Khatun, 50, as her husband struggles to fasten fresh tarpaulin to the bamboo frame that forms their home. “When it rains, the water leaks inside and makes the firewood wet. When we try to set a fire, nothing happens. So we throw kerosene on to the firewood and it becomes easier to light. Without kerosene or plastic or paper, it’s very hard to cook.” Even her stove, hand-moulded from mud, has become wet in recent weeks after one side of the shelter was ripped out by heavy winds. Storms have destroyed their dwelling twice since the rains started in June, on each occasion causing damage that has necessitated weeks of repair work by her husband.Makeshift shelters like Khatun’s have mushroomed near the Bangladesh-Myanmar border since last August, when a Myanmar military operation claimed an estimated 6,700 lives and prompted more than 700,000 people to flee across the border.  The majority clustered in the forests around Kutupalong, which has become one of the world’s largest refugee camps. Once an area of thick greenery, Kutupalong has become a sea of plastic tents propped up against each other and hanging from hillsides weakened by the rains. Months of preparation were intended to limit the effects of the monsoon but much of that work has been undone sandbags intended to shore up hills have themselves burst, and fortifications for family shelters have largely failed to prevent them flooding.Providing food has been a challenge since the latest and largest wave of Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh. Aside from having to hunt for fuel, many struggle with the lack of variety in their ration. But the increasing difficulty of simply cooking those basic supplies has added to their vulnerability.Some, like Khatun’s family, try to set aside extra rice for their next meal whenever they are able to cook. They are often the families who use kerosene to ignite the fire, despite the dangerous smoke it produces. Others simply make do with weak flames that take hours to even partially cook rice. The issues are worse for families whose homes have not only been damaged by winds but completely inundated by floodwater, rendering firewood useless and causing rice and lentil supplies to rot. “There’s nothing I can do about it, unless I hang the bags from the roof,” says Sharmin Akhter, two days after returning to her shelter following flooding earlier in July.“It was raining heavily and there were strong winds, like a mini-cyclone,” she recalls. “It rained much longer than usual, so the stream below flowed into the house. We were asleep – we didn’t realise until the water came inside.”For more than two weeks, Akhter had to rely on relatives to provide her family with shelter and food until her home was repaired. In several areas of the camps, Rohingya said they had often had to ask neighbours for food or request help from local camp leaders, known as Majhis, some of whom were coordinating families under their watch to ensure everyone was fed. Families without those options say they simply had to go without. The World Food Programme (WFP) says that over the past week it has had to provide more than 1,560 people with prepared hot meals and 700 households with additional food aid, mostly in the form of high-energy biscuits. Wet firewood also poses health risks for the refugees, says Peter Agnew, the emergency coordinator in Bangladesh for the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, especially since wholesale deforestation in the area means the wood they do collect is very young.  “It’s green and it still has leaves on it,” says Agnew. “You cook with that stuff in your house and it immediately fills packed full of smoke. “Did you see any of the kids with the green stuff running out of their eyes? It’s really common, it’s eye infections. They hang out with their mother while they’re cooking and they get gunked-up infections in their eyes.” Breathing problems have also increased. The World Health Organization’s weekly health reports showed a consistent rise in the number of patients for Acute Respiratory Infections to more than 10,000 per week during July. The Rohingyas’ struggle to survive using firewood has not surprised the humanitarian community, which had already identified a need for sustainable fuel supplies in crisis situations.  A programme called Safe Access to Fuel and Energyhas been specifically developed to counter the use of wood for fuel, but the size and scale of the Rohingya crisis has proved challenging. “The rapid onset of this particular response, and the sheer scale of the challenge, made planning for cooking fuel challenging in the initial period, especially with such pressing and large-scale humanitarian needs,” says Shelley Thakral, Cox’s Bazar spokesperson for the WFP. Almost a year has passed since the Rohingya influx, but the majority are still relying on firewood. Aid workers blame technical problems such as deciding what fuel to use, and the fire risk associated with using gas.

The average price of a pint of beer in London is now £5.20 and regularly tops £6. Across the country, the average is about £3.50, leading to many drinkers staying at home with cans of beer bought in supermarkets instead, said Camra, which warned that more than a dozen pubs a week were closing as a result.Prices have risen steeply in recent years, with various taxes including beer duty, business rates and VAT accounting for a third of the cost, said Camra. The most expensive places for a pint outside London are Oxford (£4.57), Edinburgh and Bristol (£4.35), and Brighton (£4.24). The cheapest is Carlisle £2.35, which is two-thirds of the UK average. Craft beer in supermarkets costs about £1.50 per bottle or can (330ml) and while mass-produced lager and bitters averages less than £1.Camra is concerned that the government is planning to increase the tax paid by pubs in the November budget. Beer duty is to rise by about 2p per pint under Treasury plans, and small pubs are to lose the £1,000 in business rate relief introduced in 2017, but scheduled to end in 2019.The campaign group warned in May about the scale of pub closures, predominately in the south-east. The industry has campaigned for a VAT reduction to allow it to compete with retailers. Chains such as Wetherspoons have bucked this trend by using significant buying power to keep customer prices low. For tied and small independent pubs, that is not an option, say campaigners.Camra’s national chairman, Jackie Parker, said: “It’s no surprise that most people are finding pub pints unaffordable, given the tax burden they’re facing. Beer drinkers will naturally look to more cost-effective ways to enjoy a drink, such as buying from off-licences and supermarkets for home consumption.“The result is incredibly detrimental to our local communities and to our own personal connectivity. Having a good local makes people happier, better-connected and more trusting. Furthermore, pubs help bring communities together and support the local economy. The reality is that there are very few places that can replicate the benefit provided by our nation’s pubs, and once they’re gone, they’re gone for ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67794134f02077d6fd5e81d4c5eae18f5906a96f/0_236_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0dc24ab1b2fddbffad09e20111ffca6","title":"bestival review grace jones mia chaka khan","story":"Lulworth Estate, DorsetGrace Jones, MIA and Chaka Khan build up the crowd’s energy, but baffling scheduling threatens to dissipate itLast year’s edition of Rob da Bank’s glitter-heavy weekender – the first in its more prudent, 20,000-capacity form away from the the Isle of Wight – was a far from auspicious start. As well as poor weather and cancellations from the likes of grime star Wiley, there was also the death of 25-year-old Louella Michie, who suffered a drug overdose.As such, Bestival 2018 feels like it’s on the back foot from the outset, a feeling only emphasised when – a week before – sister festival Camp Bestival is beset by torrential rain, forcing organisers to pull its final day. And the opening night has an unpromising air, despite circus-themed props and costumes aplenty, with Mark Ronson and Diplo’s funky new side hustle Silk City – an act who didn’t exist when tickets for the festival went on sale – headlining. Theirs is a glorified DJ set, featuring a clutch of anaemic pop remixes, obvious club choices such as Armand Van Helden and Janet Jackson, and their three original songs to date.The fact that their set clashes with that of dance duo du jour Bicep is also the first of several questionable scheduling choices. While buzzy south London post-post-punk band Shame find themselves in the Big Top, similarly abrasive, politically minded Idles are given free rein to riot – and even interpolate Skepta – on the main stage. Elsewhere, Mercury prize-nominated Jorja Smith occupies a 1am slot on an otherwise quiet Thursday, presumably decided before her rapid ascent in 2018. And if gaps between major acts often feel overly long, none are longer than when Stefflon Don cancels on Saturday afternoon, leaving a 90-minute gulf on the main stage. Even so, there is much that Bestival gets right. Saturday night sees Grace Jones bring her unending eccentricity to the main stage, limbs covered in white patterns as she whips a male dancer during Pull Up to the Bumper and twirls a hula hoop around her waist for the entirety of Slave to the Rhythm. The evening’s headliners London Grammar pack an ethereal punch via dry ice and soaring reveries, and Chaka Khan delivers the perfect Sunday evening set that went from deep cuts to a greatest-hits medley. Elsewhere, Mali’s Songhoy Blues cast off any hackneyed world music labels with their compelling rock, while Swedish duo First Aid Kit balance countrified ballads with searing #MeToo anthem You Are the Problem Here. And some of the country’s buzziest acts – among them grunge-tinged girl band the Big Moon, lo-fi R\u0026ampB talent Nilüfer Yanya and Black Honey, who fuse 90s indie and electronica – are spread liberally across the weekend. As MIA appears on Sunday night to deliver her trademark aggro agitpop, a troupe of Tamil dancers in tow, the main stage is far from swarmed. Contrasted with the 80,000-strong Bestival of old, it’s an underwhelming turnout, the singer’s vitality often feeling wasted as she zips from the hyperactive flair of her debut album Arular all the way to the provocative pop of Borders, via a crowd-pleasing medley of Bad Girls and Boyz. As numbers build for a finale of Paper Planes, it’s clear that it’s singalong choruses that really draw the crowds – and their Instagram stories – here.

Dressed in grey leggings with a pink band around the waist and a black sports bra, Davids paced around her corner of the cage, eyeing her opponent, Nadia Nixon, as the ring announcer roared their names to the eager crowd in Kansas City, Missouri.At the sound of the bell, Davids leapt forward and landed a clean left hook that sent her opponent tumbling to the mat. The crowd cheered as Davids mounted her opponent and continued her onslaught. Not long afterwards, the referee separated the fighters and allowed Davids back to her feet. She had won her first professional fight in less than two minutes. The Kansas native was calm, precise and brutally effective in victory – a perfect start to what could have been a fruitful career. Though it was clear that Davids belonged in the fight game, few realized that the stage she was destined to compete on would be the political arena.The 37-year-old is one of the Democrats running against Republican Kevin Yoder in Kansas’s third congressional district. Since her campaign took off, Davids has received support from the American political action committee, Emily’s List, which announced it was putting $400,000 of Super Pac money behind her. Should Davids win Tuesday’s Democratic primary, she will run against Yoder in the general election on 6 November. As a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, a Native American tribe in Wisconsin, Davids also has the opportunity to make history as the first Native American woman to win a seat in the US Congress. As a child, Davids was fascinated with martial arts. She was obsessed with Bruce Lee, admiring his work ethic and discipline, and mimicked him by wearing a black belt around the house. However, despite her fascination with Lee, Davids did not begin practicing martial arts until she was a 19-year-old college student. “I didn’t get to train because I was raised by a single mom,” Davids says, recalling her childhood. “There were three of us and it was just too expensive to pay for me to do martial arts practice.”Davids started by learning capoeira and karate. She then moved on to taekwondo with a coach who had experience training MMA professionals. After several months together, the coach asked if she would be interested in fighting in a local MMA event. Davids had little interest in participating in what she believed was a barbaric sport. Over time, however, Davids learned more about the sport, as well as the training regimen that fighters go through in preparation for bouts.By 2006, Davids was prepared to take a leap of faith. She made her amateur debut at the International Sport Combat Federation’s Midwest FightFest, and won in less than a minute. Victory was exhilarating but Davids decided to instead to focus on her studies at Cornell law school. She knew better than to try to make a career out of the sport she had grown to love. “In terms of career options, I didn’t think about MMA at all,” says Davids. “I don’t know if I really thought it was a career path for many women. For someone like me, even in my prime, it wasn’t something I really considered.”In February, 2007 — less than a year after Davids made her amateur debut — Gina Carano and Julie Kedzie competed in the first women’s MMA fight to air on live television — a groundbreaking moment for women who sought a career in MMA. Davids and a group of her friends gathered that night to watch the historic fight. Within a few years, the sport had changed dramatically. The charismatic and supremely talented Ronda Rousey was on her way to becoming one of UFC’s biggest draws, and her sudden rise to stardom led to the creation of a women’s UFC bantamweight ision. Suddenly, it seemed as though there were more female fighters getting into the sport than ever before. Even Davids began to ask herself whether her time had finally come. When the UFC announced a 115lbs women’s edition of The Ultimate Fighter (TUF) — a reality show that places fighters in a mansion for several weeks as they work their way through a tournament for a “six-figure UFC contract” — Davids jumped at the opportunity. “I had been so passionate about martial arts for so long that I felt that I wanted to at least try, which is why I took my first pro fight.”Davids won her first pro fight by submission, but lost the second before signing up for the TUF tryouts in Las Vegas. She was overwhelmed by the scene in front of her: hundreds of young fighters grappling on the mats as judges looked on. “It was surreal,” Davids says. The competition was fierce and by the end of the day, she knew she would be taking a one-way trip back to Kansas.When Davids returned to Kansas, she shifted focus. She began to travel the United States and live on Native American reservations to work with the communities. She has since become a nationally recognized expert on economic and community development programs and initiatives for Native Americans. By 2016, she was one of 16 people selected to participate in the White House Fellowship program. Davids’s time in Washington DC came during the Obama-Trump transition period. In many ways, it was the spark that kindled her career in politics: “It pushed me a little quicker into something like running for office,” Davids explains.According to Davids, women are underrepresented in the US federal government. This is particularly evident in Congress, where she believes citizens “need to have the option to vote for qualified women.” Davids is not alone in her thinking — a record-setting 309 women, Republicans and Democrats alike, are running for the US House of Representatives in 2018. Davids is also part of a record number of Native American women running for office. She is one of four Native American women running for congress, a group that includes Deb Haaland, who won the Democratic nomination in New Mexico’s 1st district. “The fact that we are in 2018 and we are still seeing all these firsts is mind-boggling to me. When I stop and think about it, it makes me very proud to be a part of this movement that is happening in our country. I feel like all of us are playing a role in this. This unprecedented number of women running for office – myself and a couple of other candidates are native women – makes me very proud.” Though Davids was working hard in pursuit of her political dreams long before she knew she had the opportunity to make history, she admits it adds a sense of gravitas to what she hopes to achieve, and gives her a feeling that only fighters can relate to. “It is like being in the third round of a fight and you’ve already pushed as hard as you can in the entire fight and then you hear your coach yell ‘10 seconds’ and you get that last little bump of energy. That is what this feels like. I was already running for congress. I was already trying to make an impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ea1aedab0dde8ca14881c0b64f206da0f004f3d/194_57_3012_1807/master/3012.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eb4465ebfe67756f395a026e369b115","title":"talking horses enables return could be delayed until next month","story":"Arc-winning filly has not raced since her big day in Paris and connections may opt to avoid running her at York this monthIt’s a worrying time for fans of Enable, as her connections spent the weekend talking about the possibility of her skipping York this month and waiting for Kempton’s September Stakes to make her reappearance. The filly hasn’t raced since landing the Arc 10 months ago and her return was delayed by the swelling found in a knee in May. Cautionary notes were issued two days after Enable did a bit of work on the Al Bahathri gallop last Wednesday. Lord Grimthorpe, who speaks for her owner, Khalid Abdullah, said: “It was nothing very serious but she showed a good action and attitude as well, and she’s taking little steps towards a comeback run. York would be a nice option, but we will certainly not push her to get there just for that race.”He elaborated in comments reported by the Racing Post: “She’s not going to be pushed to get to York. If she’s screaming to go there she’ll probably go, but it’s not like she has to. Having been 7-2 for the International at one time, Enable is double those odds with most bookmakers now and has traded above 40-1 on Betfair. She might face Poet’s Word and Cracksman in that race, while Sea Of Class lurks in the Yorkshire Oaks, so you can see why connections might prefer an easier reintroduction. But another delay to her comeback would hardly encourage with regard to her Arc chance.We’ll see how it plays out and perhaps she may yet show up at York in fine condition but I must admit that I’m looking at her Longchamp rivals and wondering which of them might now be worth a bet.Punters are altogether more positive about Sheepscar Lad (3.30), a 7-4 shot for a sprint handicap at Ripon today. Four times a winner over the past year, this four-year-old came up short by just a head at Pontefract eight days ago and gets to run from the same mark. He comes from the in-form yard of Nigel Tinkler.Sheepscar Lad needs a bit of a cushion in the ground and I’m hoping there’s enough at Ripon, which has had 50mm of rain over the last 11 days, though the good to soft has dried out of the going description this morning. Earlier, Mikmak has come out of the 10-furlong handicap, which makes me feel better about Racemaker (3.00), although it seems to have shortened the odds of all the fancied horses except him and he’s fairly priced at 9-2. Andy Crook’s runner is two from four since blinkers were fitted and his run style suggests an extra two furlongs will be fine, for all that he didn’t cope with it as a younger horse. Tajdeed (5.00) is of interest at 11-2. A Mark Johnston debutant, he’s a half brother to five horses that won on their debuts for Johnston. On the other hand, most of them did so as juveniles the fact that Tajdeed has not raced until the late summer of his three-year-old year suggests, for a horse of his pedigree, that all has not been plain sailing. Still, I’ll happily chance him at that price in a race in which he has two serious rivals, one of whom seems limited after two races. Al Kherb is the predictable favourite but he’s got a 7lb penalty for a short-head success and isn’t certain to want this mile and a half.

Our mischievous hosts, Youngkyun Yeom and Seungeun Lee, are wearing matching costumes – white T-shirts, black trousers and braces – and armed with marker pens and big imaginations. First the duo invite us to sketch pictures of them on mini whiteboards, then they draw our portraits and we become characters in their show. Before long, they are animating their scribbles and smudges on a huge screen to create a nautical adventure. As they ambush us with their handiwork, and attempt to outdo each other, they switch between the roles of conspirators and competitors. There’s a twinkle in both performances and in the jaunty keyboard accompaniment, too.A kids’ show that captures the magic of cookery with cracking eggs, a shower of flour through a sieve and the irresistible smell of a cake baked on stage. This tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is framed by the storyteller’s own preparations for her daughter’s 16th, and her memories of family birthdays gone by give the show a lovely wistful air. Danyah Miller quickly establishes a rapport with the young audience, inviting plenty of participation. If the puppets by Little Angel don’t have the wow factor of some of their other creations, they are appealing in their ingenuity: not least the colander cat. This is a show to celebrate – and it’s possibly the only time you’ll be delighted to find a mouse peeping its nose out of a bag of flour. Ever left kids alone to clean up their room and returned to find it twice as untidy? That’s the setup for the Australian company Hoopla Clique’s raucous circus show in the Piccolo tent. Two brothers – one shock-haired, the other floppy-fringed – are ordered to put away their toys, but within five minutes they’re hurling balls at each other, breaking out backflips and wielding homemade weaponry that sends toilet paper streaming every which way. Derek Llewelin and Julian Roberts’ sense of fun is infectious and their high-energy pranks thrill – and occasionally appal – the young audience. The result is a mess that, mercifully, you can leave someone else to tidy up. Watch out when they start washing the windows and definitely don’t try this at home.Fifteen junkshop chairs enter the stage: half are pushed on in a rickety procession by one dancer, the others are piled high and given an unwieldy piggyback by her partner. They are precisely placed around the space, creating an obstacle course for the duo, who discover unexpected worlds of play with these props, much like the monks find multiple uses for the boxes in Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s Sutra. There’s plenty of mischief and gentle humour in this sophisticated show for the over-threes from Belgium’s Compagnie Nyash, choreographed by Caroline Cornélis and deftly danced by Miko Shimura and Colin Jolet.Read the full four-star reviewChildren’s theatre isn’t just for kids, of course, and such is cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat’s following, there are plenty of child-free audience members to see him hatch his first family show. Whether they’re taken from Willy Wonka, The Lion King or the Pussycat Dolls, the songs he has chosen to cover – as in his grownup set, Icons – feel both personal and universal as they celebrate fun, fantasy and pride. Riffing on Hans Christian Andersen, this is the tale of a duckling who doesn’t quack and kick in quite the right style for a feathery circus troupe. So many kids’ shows at the fringe crank up the volume and bombard you with bright colours but while there is some sparkle here, and a sprinkling of audience participation, the show isn’t afraid of darkness – not least in its lugubriously lit and exquisitely designed set. You’re left savouring not just the singer’s voice – warm and deep enough to bathe in – but also the elegant drawl of Tommy Bradson’s narration.Denim, the queens of subversive late-night drag cabaret, put on an afternoon kids’ concert in which they clean up some of the content, keep the inclusive message and lose none of their wit or glamour. For the over-fives, what’s not to like about a quintet with fabulous frocks, megawatt smiles, glittery facial hair and a gift for make-believe? They treat the cosy Piccolo tent as if they’re playing to 80,000 of their biggest fans. Aqua’s Barbie Girl becomes a slow jam (“Life in sequins, it’s got new meanings!”), Cyndi Lauper’s anthem is rejigged for the school run (Mothers Just Want to Have Fun) and Let It Go has seldom sounded so empowering. By the time they’ve given some of the kids a drag-queen makeover and mashed together Miley Cyrus and Bon Jovi in the closing medley, the bond between performers and audience feels just about unbreakable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7fb0834f26967259e66fd47934fd969a428224d/0_17_2892_1736/master/2892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d76cba8c18944ad98a0df7f23b152cf","title":"star trek boldly goes back the welcome return of jean luc picard","story":"Fans of the franchise already enjoy rebooted films and Discovery, but a deep e into one of the show’s most intriguing characters could be the best yetIf you travelled back to 2002 and told the world that there would one day be a television programme about the continued adventures of Jean-Luc Picard, chances are you’d get a smack in the mouth. By 2002, Picard and the entire Star Trek: The Next Generation crew were a spent force. The four films to feature the TNG cast (Generations, First Contact, Insurrection and Nemesis) were hugely disappointing affairs cheap, staid and targeted too squarely at a thin sliver of fanatics. It would take seven years and a radical overhaul of the franchise to make Star Trek anything like popular again. Picard, it was assumed, would die with Nemesis.How things change. Now there’s not only going to be a new Picard-centric Star Trek series, but people are actually looking forward to it. During the Las Vegas Star Trek Convention, it was announced that Patrick Stewart, Alex Kurtzman, Akiva Goldsman, Kirsten Beyer and Michael Chabon were teaming up to “tell the story of the next chapter of Picard’s life”. That’s a vague promise, but a rapturously received one nonetheless.Thanks to Star Trek’s new series, Discovery, the franchise is in a radically different place to the slightly backwards-looking era of the modern reboots. Although far from perfect – it was saggy and overcomplicated in places – Discovery had a confident sheen of prestige to it. It couldn’t quite enter the realm of the all-time greats (for my money it was five episodes too long), but it showed enough promise to blow the Star Trek universe wide apart. Now there’s Discovery, a fourth rebooted film, the mooted Tarantino project and the Star Trek: Short Treks miniseries on the go at once, and a new Picard series should slot into this landscape seamlessly.Of course, most of the excitement about this series concerns Patrick Stewart. Not only is he a beloved figure in the Star Trek world – if it wasn’t for him, after all, Star Trek captains would still be bonehead punch-’em-up Kirk analogues – but his range has increased enormously in the last decade or so. Stewart’s light touch, previously only glimpsed in outtakes is much more pronounced now. Nobody watched him in Starz’s Blunt Talk, but his was an almost virtuoso-level comedic performance. I’d bet my life on the bulk of the Picard show being heavily dramatic, but let’s not forget that the main character drinks Earl Grey and enjoys the work of Gilbert and Sullivan. If it can incorporate even a shade of Frasier in Space, I’d be thrilled.But the most exciting name on that roster might just be Kirsten Beyer. Beyer was a staff writer on Discovery, but she’s also written 10 Star Trek: Voyager novels. Her works – such as Full Circle or Children of the Storm – kept the diehard fans going through Star Trek’s lean years. They were able to wing off in directions that film and television couldn’t allow, going deep into technology and mythology and concentrating on minor but well-loved side characters. Beyer is essentially a fan who knows the canon inside out and has been given the keys to the kingdom. The nearest television equivalent to this is when Russell T Davies got to reboot Doctor Who, and that went quite well.Let’s not be too prematurely triumphant here. This sort of thing doesn’t always go as smoothly as anyone would like, especially since fans often demonstrate a toxic proprietorship over work they enjoy. Look at the hammering that Rian Johnson continues to take for not painstakingly adhering to doctrine on the last Star Wars film – or look at the showrunner churn that preceded Discovery – and it’s clear that opposition to this could come from any quarter.But pessimism isn’t a very Star Trek quality. It has always been about the exploration of bravery and open-eyed enthusiasm, so let’s start there. In principle, a Jean-Luc Picard series could be tremendous. If everyone involved walks the fine line between respecting the past and breaking new ground, then this might be a show worth getting really excited about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6326cf35be7abc717d28b4229603744ecb849f16/1_0_2359_1417/master/2359.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d33fad358441b2acbf0ae9c4651e29","title":"my ivf life from a partners view","story":"E, Jean Hannah Edelstein’s husband, explains his side of IVF treatment, from the sperm analysis to the importance of patienceWhat’s it like to be the partner of someone going through IVF treatment? This week, I sat down to discuss the experience with my husband, E. Like me, E is in his mid-30s and has never had kids before. Here’s what he told me. We discussed IVF very early in our relationship – it’s been with us basically from the beginning. On our first date we talked about cancer in our families – I lost my mom about a year before you lost your dad, you told me about Lynch syndrome – and we talked about having kids. So we must have talked about it, too. We all get to places in different ways. So, if having kids couldn’t work for you the old-fashioned way, it made sense that we’d take a different route.I didn’t feel at all panicked when we got started with IVF. I was excited. I told my friends and family that it was exciting news, whereas you sometimes worried that people would judge us for it. You’re doing a science experiment that makes your own baby it’s kind of cool. In some ways it was more straightforward than doing it naturally, in that we didn’t have to wait every month to see if you were going to get pregnant. We didn’t have to think about timing or rhythm, we didn’t have to deal with the disappointment of you getting your period. To an extent, we were lucky to avoid that stage of the process.I wasn’t too worried when I went for my sperm analysis at the hospital. First, they give you a little plastic cup. They take you into a room where they show you where the pornographic materials are. In this room it was an assortment of magazines with “barely legal” themes and an Apple TV with videos that mostly had words like “spunk” in the title. I thought that was weird. Who selects the materials? The room also has a Lay-Z-Boy recliner of indeterminate age, and on top of the recliner is something that looks like a giant dentist bib for you to sit on. I’ve never done that before. It wasn’t my ideal scenario for creating new life.Anyway, you do your thing, and there’s a small window the size of a dog door, but at eye level. You open the door and put your specimen in, and then as soon as you close the door you hear a person on the other side opening another door and taking the specimen out. I don’t think that’s the same person who selects the pornography. My results didn’t surprise me: I had a normal sperm count, but I also had a slightly above-average number of abnormal sperm, which made sense because I consider myself a little weird. I thought the genetic testing was interesting. I’m not going to do 23andMe or a similar test, because I’m worried about them selling my data, so I liked learning those things about myself in an environment where I knew they wouldn’t be using my DNA to start a clone war.When it came to the injections: you seemed to have a lot of anxiety because you didn’t know what was going to happen, so you were a little scared, and you also told me at first that you felt it was something that you had to do on your own. I would have been OK with that, but I was also very happy when the time came around and you asked me to help, because I wanted to be part of it. I didn’t mind the disruption to our life – if you needed me to be home because we had to do the injections at a very specific time, I was happy to be home. To be honest, the only thing I’m still upset about is the shelf. I really wanted to build that shelf, and we still don’t have it.When our results weren’t great in the first round, you were worried. You were talking about not doing it again, but we thought through it and decided to persist. The second round was definitely harder for you. I didn’t have to do much more, you just felt much worse from the extra hormones. Because we’d only been together for a relatively short amount of time, a lot of things came up in our relationship in the IVF process that hadn’t before. We had to discuss a lot of personal things that we hadn’t before discussed – some of them very intimate, bordering on gross. Our patience with each other hadn’t been tried this much in our relationship before. But this also taught us that we can get through stuff together. We focused on what we have to do for the route that works for us. And hopefully everything will turn out the way we want it to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/638d1498fb91edf16bc8f6bd1be7d18aabac3405/0_276_4200_2519/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be89b56edcea4fcd80da3f12567f66b9","title":"pride and prejudice the americans who fly the confederate flag","story":"A listening tour in Mississippi asks flag supporters why they still support a symbol that represents pain, ision and difficult historyby  Donna Ladd with pictures by Kate MedleyIt was 1957 when little Lindy Luby’s great-uncle showed up at her house near Benton, Mississippi, where the family had lived for generations. He was a justice of the peace in Yazoo City, the gateway to the fertile, brutal lands of the Delta.“Effie, it’s just been a bad day,” the lawman said to his sister, as the six-year-old listened. “I just had to go cut a black boy down off that hanging tree and take him to his mama.”The infamous tree, used for lynching, was bending over a bridge on Highway 433 toward Lexington.“What did he do?” Effie Luby asked.“He raped and killed a white woman.”Lindy, now 66, has shifted her stance on the death penalty. After she sat on a jury that condemned a man to death, she now campaigns for alternatives to execution and stars in a new documentary about her experience.The first cut of the film also showed Lindy and husband, Ira Isonhood, flying the Confederate battle flag on a 20ft pole in the backyard of one of their homes.To many white people in the south and beyond, the Confederate flag is a sign of historic pride and defiance to whatever is currently called “liberalism” to most black Americans, the flag stands for white supremacy and racial violence. Today, the symbol often appears at “pro-white” rallies and is a lightning rod in America’s calcifying racial ides.The flag’s history is fraught and complicated, as was the bloody civil war that erupted in 1861 between the US south – where America’s slave trade had relocated and expanded by the mid-1800s – and the north. After the north won, it imposed a harsh Reconstruction on the south that still fuels white resentment today.The post-war white south embraced the Confederate battle flag, making it their sentimental symbol of the “lost cause” of the war. By the time Mississippi embedded it into its new state flag in 1894, the flag was used to both honor the Confederate dead as well as a romanticized version of the war’s purpose.By the mid-20th century, the flag symbolized white resistance to ending segregation laws. The Ku Klux Klan flew it at lynching parties and angry mobs waved it outside public schools as black children enrolled in front of of white “segregation academies” and next to leering dogs unleashed on black protesters wanting the right to vote. (Today, its supporters say the KKK co-opted it.) In April 2001, Mississippians voted along race lines to keep the flag as it was. The debate reignited in 2015 after Dylann Roof killed nine black people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina. A photo soon emerged of him holding a Confederate flag. The matter is especially raw in Mississippi, a state that suffered tremendous Confederate casualties and went from being the richest state from slavery before the civil war to one of the poorest.The Isonhoods were the first stop of my May 2018 listening tour of Mississippi with photographer Kate Medley to ask flag supporters in our home state why they still support a symbol that represents so much pain, ision and difficult history – even as they urge black Americans to get over their resistance to it.Ira Isonhood, 71, remembers his father inviting black people to sit in his yard to watch a basketball game through the window when he got the area’s first television – a progressive move in the mid-20th century south. But he was still a product of his time.One day, a black boy came to his dad’s store with a shopping list his mother had signed with “Mrs”. His father sent a note back with no groceries. When her husband came later, the storekeeper admonished him in front of young Ira. “Don’t ever allow your wife to sign ‘Mrs’ again!” he warned.Still, Ira flies the flag, which his own high school and college used as an emblem.“The Confederate flag played a big, big part in our history,” Ira says. “… Why are these minorities pushing to do away with this flag? Look at what’s happening to our statues!” he says.Neither Ira nor Lindy has asked black acquaintances why the flag is offensive, or asked why many believe it belongs in museums, but not part of a state emblem. “I don’t think the black people around here care,” Lindy says.She wonders why the flag is once again becoming a big deal. “Is it their feelings? … Mississippi has bent over backwards to say I’m sorry. How much more do we need to do?”I later relay Lindy’s questions to Genesis Be, a 31-year-old hip-hop artist, public speaker and anti-Confederate flag activist from Biloxi. I met Be after reporting that her grandfather, Pastor Clyde Briggs, was a target of the Klan in the 1960s for trying to organize and arm black people against white supremacy. I have stuck my finger into a bullet hole in her family home where the Klan fired into the wall above where her aunt, then a child, slept.“What has Mississippi done to say that it is sorry for the rape, torturing and killings of scores of its black citizens in order to create a white majority?” Be says. “Open a museum?”“I’ve never heard of an apology from the Klan in Franklin County for harassing and assaulting my family while flying that flag. All I’ve heard is a downplaying and whitewashing of history in an attempt to gaslight its population.”Ongoing inequities, Be reminds, are bolstered by a kinder, gentler version of Confederate history rewritten after the south lost the civil war and its rights to maintain and extend slavery.After driving north along the lonely stretch of Highway 49 through Delta plantation lands, we end up in Larry McCluney Jr’s attic in Greenwood.The room is a shrine to the Confederacy with a rebel-flag-themed cushion, curtains and even a mousepad. There’s also a civil war chess set. The closet is packed with battle re-enactment costumes and weapon replicas.McCluney, 53, is a national officer in the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which accepts male descendants of southern soldiers. SCV was created in 1896 for the “vindication of the cause for which we fought” and to ensure “that a true history of the 1861-1865 period is preserved.” SCV members worked with the United Confederate Veterans and other groups in the early 20th century to demand school textbooks supporting the revisionist view that the south fought for a just “lost cause” that was decidedly not slavery. McCluney has taught history and government for 25 years to mostly black Delta students.“People like me … it’s in our blood. We know about our family, their sacrifices,” he says of his 20 ancestors who fought for the Confederacy.“Slavery was an issue, but not the cause,” the teacher tells me. He repeats SCV’s selective semantics with precision: the south seceded over “states’ rights” to financial independence the north and Abraham Lincoln weren’t against slavery at the outset northern tariffs were killing the south few southerners and soldiers owned humans slavery was fading anyway and it wasn’t about white supremacy.The facts are more complicated. Despite decades of efforts to renovate history, Mississippi’s Declaration of Secession still begins by clarifying that the state left the union in 1861 for a cause “thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery,” adding for posterity that “none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun” that enables cotton to flourish.By 1861, the south was demanding slavery expansion into western territories, which Lincoln’s “Black Republicans” adamantly opposed. The SCV is correct, though, that Lincoln did not initially call for emancipation. In fact, Frederick Douglass called Lincoln “preeminently the white man’s president, entirely devoted to the welfare of white men.”In his attic, McCluney downplays slavery ownership – saying “elite” planters, not soldiers, owned most slaves. “Most (southerners) did not have a dog in the hunt,” he says. But slavery was waning, McCluney insists, and the north should have let it fade naturally. After I mention that Mississippi outlawed freeing slaves in 1857, he said that the south wouldn’t have seceded if the federal government had allowed (white, male) voters to decide slavery per state or territory.McCluney teaches his black students his Confederate history. “I try to be sensitive. I’m a pointblank person. Don’t ask if you don’t want to know.” But, he adds, “they know me as a teacher who cares about them”.The educator points to Roof’s “horrible, horrible” 2015 massacre of black worshippers – and his viral photo holding the Confederate flag – as inciting a war on the emblem. “Politically correct groups seized that opportunity to make it seem like that flag came down that pole, walked down into that church and killed those people,” he says. “… That was horrific to my organization (SCV) when that took place.”I later share those words with Derrick Johnson, the national president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), who previously led the Mississippi chapter.“Wow,” he says, then pauses.Then Johnson turns to Roof: “All of the views and racial hatred symbols that informed his opinion walked into that church with him. He’s more than enough reason that the symbols of the Confederacy should be removed from the public square.”Thomasa Massey, 49, jumps out of her car at Pearl Park in a majority-white Jackson suburb wearing a T-shirt with Confederate butterflies she designed with “Pride, Not Prejudice” underneath.When I had interviewed her about being in a white gang, I saw her defending the flag on Facebook. Her friend Evangela Hentz, who is black, opens the passenger door, and we all run through the rain to a pavilion. The two single mothers finish each other’s sentences, laughing about that time Hentz went into labor where they worked and Massey put her in an office chair to wheel her downstairs to go to the hospital. “I have struggled. She’s helped me. She’s struggled. I’ve been there for her,” Massey, the child’s godmother, says.“We just didn’t believe in racism. Nobody, my whole town,” she says.The Confederate flag represents pride in the face of poverty to Massey, who came to Mississippi in 2001, the same year voters decided against changing the state flag. She supports Mississippians’ right to keep it as is. “It was there when our grandfathers, great-grandfathers, were struggling to feed their six, eight, 10 kids. It flew for all colors, black, white, whatever,” she says.Hentz, 41, is from Missouri, once a violent slave state, but calls the flag just an “inanimate object,” adding: “Stop letting it control you.”“If you don’t breathe life into something, it will die,” Massey adds.The friends reject being offended over what Hentz calls “just a piece of cloth”.Be, who discusses the flag respectfully with friends who like it, challenges Massey, Hentz and others to probe deeper.“It was poor white southerners who fought in these battles, being strung along by rich, property-owning whites who banked on the ignorance and arrogance of the poor whites to fight and die in the war,” Be says.“They gave their life, but for what?”Gentlemanly Kevin Davis is surprised when we show up at his large white antebellum-style house in Simpson County. We are stopping by homes with flags, but owners keep pointing us on down the road to him.Davis – no relation to Jeff – has taught history in public and private schools, and also turned out to be an SCV member. Thirteen of his ancestors fought for the south, but most didn’t own slaves. Three died in battle, and one in a makeshift hospital in the Lyceum at Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi – one of numerous buildings built by slaves.“To me, the flag is not a racist thing. It’s a piece of our heritage that should be left there to honor sacrifices,” Davis says in a cozy parlor, adding that most soldiers were “dirt-door farmers” with no slaves. Davis, 47, also believes the institution might have died out due to “modernization … if they were able to compromise another 20 years. That’s what state’s rights were about: protecting slavery,” he says. “… There would not have been a war over tariffs.”Most Confederacy fans may cherry-pick their side’s history, but many are more precise about the chinks in the Yankees’ armor – including that not everyone up north was hip to slavery ending, either.And, as McCluney points out, New York-financed slave ships kept sailing to West Africa for people to be sold in the Caribbean and South America.Davis is circumspect on the complicated history: “I can say it was wrong, and I hope I wouldn’t have participated in (slavery), but how can we know for sure?”Still, Davis balks at the need to exorcise the emblem from the state flag today out of respect to Mississippians who descended from slaves. His own ancestors’ sacrifice is paramount. “It’s so we don’t forget,” he says.The history teacher could handle it if the state flag changed, though. “I would be sad about it, not violently upset. I would not be up around the last flag making a chain gang to keep somebody from taking it down,” Davis says.We’re on Highway 49 south when it pops up: Flag Heads, which sells “adult novelties” and Confederate tchotchkes.“You won’t find it at Wal*Mart,” a large sign proclaims, reminding shoppers that the retailer dropped Confederate merchandise within a week of Roof’s massacre.If you can put a rebel flag on it, they do: beach towels, BBQ aprons, windshield dice, coasters, flip-flops, polar fleeces, bikinis, umbrellas and more. Pipes fill a glass case, and we avoid the curtained adult room.Petite Roslyn Stuart is behind the counter with a swagger like she has seen it all more than once. She immediately brings up Roof.“Until that kid went in that church in Charleston, people never thought anything about the Confederate or Mississippi flag,” she says. “… The flag not gone change the hate.”Stuart blames detractors. “It’s not us that’s racial it’s them that’s racial. Most of ’em don’t know what it means,” she says. “It’s a symbol of our state it’s who we are.”She continues: “Northern people were down here trying to burn all our stuff” – true the Yankees torched Jackson three times – “and we were trying to stop them … They didn’t think it was right we had slaves. It turned into one big heckuva mess. It’s lingering still out there.”She worries that young people now think the flag stands for the KKK. “Eventually, they will take the state flag they will change it. What’s next? The Christian flag?” she asks.A black FedEx man wouldn’t come through the front door, she says, instead leaving heavy packages on the porch because “he thinks we’re racial”. So she asked for a new driver and got one.“Come on over!” Joe Barnes booms, describing his nearby Seminary home as the one with the US, Confederate and Mississippi flags out front, after I tell him Roslyn sent us.Barnes, 66, beams as he hands us his SCV card with Nathan Bedford Forrest, the wealthy Memphis slave trader and first KKK grand wizard, pictured on the front.Retired military, Barnes used to attend all the Ole Miss college football games, but he now watches on TV. He wrote the chancellor that he would never buy another ticket after the game ban of the rebel flag.“Our ancestors fought under that flag,” Barnes says. “It’s not about hatred.” He adds that blacks fought for the south, too. (True, but usually for their masters. Many defected to segregated union camps.)“Schools are not teaching history the right way,” he says. “… It’s not whites that are the racists it’s mostly the blacks … What it boils down to is black people are just trying to overrule us.”“If we can’t get white people to stand together, it’s going to be another civil war,” he adds.Barnes has black friends, he says, and points out that African Americans use the N-word. “White folks can be that, too. There are trashy white people and trashy black people.”SCV is not racist or violent, he says. “The Klan is different from us. The SCV might fly the flag, but we don’t associate with them. We’re not a violent organization. We try to help people.”Johnson, CEO of the NAACP, says he wishes poor whites would recognize how powerful politicians have long played racial politics with Confederate emblems – a deliberate strategy to ide them from people with shared economic interests.“The very same people that exploit the working class for cheap labor and create systems to undermine their development through poor education systems use issues of racial ision to maintain economic control,” the NAACP president says.The flag could easily be honored or studied in museums, he adds.“The NAACP respects the constitutional, first amendment right for private citizens to maintain symbols and monuments on private property,” he says. “Enjoy.”“Can you tell me why?”On the last day, I again sit with Lindy Isonhood, this time at Deer Hollow, their other home farther south where Ira’s Confederate man cave, as Kate is calling the rooms we’ve seen, is packed with deer antlers, a boar’s head trophy, and little rebel flags. Ira is in the backyard posing for pictures in front of his Confederate flag.Lindy has thought about our first conversation overnight and wants to understand why I do not support the flag.“The war really was about slavery, and they didn’t hide it then,” I say as she listens intently. “But I don’t believe everyone who likes the flag is racist. Many people were taught certain things.”I add that the ision most hurts poor whites and people of color.Lindy nods, describing her childhood of poverty when the family’s land was all they had left. Her sister would exchange clothes with a black friend, she says. “My family, we were poor. When I graduated from high school, we didn’t have an indoor toilet.”“I am going to start researching this,” she adds about the history as Kate calls for her. Knowing that Lindy now talks to other Mississippians after rethinking the death penalty, I feel a twinge of hope as I watch Ira’s rebel flag flying outside the window of Deer Hollow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5774a89e28ef742c3e158e403fc9aaa4f6279446/0_178_4760_2855/master/4760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf91dc0e40699e18bb09f07c838f2577","title":"chris patten china wrong to try to silence hong kong activist","story":"Former British governor of Hong Kong defends foreign correspondents club after Beijing urged it to cancel speechFormer British governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten has said it was “quite simply wrong” for Beijing to urge the city’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club to cancel a planned speech by an independence activist.Patten’s comments came after China’s ministry of foreign affairs stepped in to request the decades-old press club pull the talk by Andy Chan of the Hong Kong National Party, a group threatened with a ban.Semi-autonomous Hong Kong was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 under an agreement which protected its way of life for 50 years, giving it rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech.But concern is growing that those freedoms are being eroded by an increasingly assertive Beijing.China’s foreign ministry recently requested a meeting with the FCC and asked for the event to be cancelled, a source told AFP.In a statement issued on Friday, the ministry said: “We resolutely oppose any external forces providing a platform for ‘Hong Kong independence’ elements to spread fallacies.”“There is no justification for censoring people because you don’t like what they have to say,” said Patten.He said freedom of speech was one of the “hallmarks of an open society living under the rule of law” and was protected by the handover agreement.“I have consistently argued against the idea of advocating independence for Hong Kong,” added Patten. “But I also continue to argue for Hong Kong’s liberties and local autonomy. It is quite simply wrong for Beijing’s Communist foreign ministry to get involved with an issue which should be determined within Hong Kong.”City leader Carrie Lam, appointed by a pro-Beijing committee, on Sunday expressed “regret” at the planned event and noted that the historic club building is government-owned.The club has said Chan’s talk on 14 August will still go ahead.It is part of a “club lunch” tradition which has seen an array of speakers, including Chinese officials, address members and the media.Activists calling for independence from Hong Kong emerged from the failure of the mass pro-democracy Umbrella Movement rallies of 2014 to win political reform. Any talk of a split has become a red flag for Beijing, which has ramped up rhetoric against threats to its territorial integrity under President Xi Jinping.Hong Kong police last month sought to ban Chan’s party – which promotes the city’s independence from China but only has a core membership of around a dozen people – citing it as a national security threat.Hong Kong’s security chief had said he was considering the police request while the party was given a few weeks to make representations.Pro-independence campaigners and politicians calling for self-determination for Hong Kong have been banned from standing for office and disqualified from the legislature.The city’s best-known independence advocate Edward Leung was jailed for six years in June on rioting charges after clashes with police in 2016.

The US has demanded Kim give up his nukes before any sanctions are lifted.North Korea has used a variety of means to sidestep the restrictions. Ship-to-ship transfers of oil and coal in the dead of night have been repeatedly documented, North Korean labourers work openly in China and Russia, and Pyongyang continues to work with Syria’s military.“Kim Jong-un is playing a very logical game. He’s getting weaker sanctions enforcement from China and Russia while engaging the United States on his terms,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who worked on North Korea policy.“If it’s possible to weaken the resolve of China and other members of the international community to impose and enforce sanctions, that’s certainly in North Korea’s interest. But North Korea isn’t so committed to that goal that it would give up its nuclear programme.”More than 10,000 North Korean workers have registered to work in Russia since September, with at least 700 obtaining work permits this year, in potential violation of UN sanctions, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. US officials estimate North Koreans working in Russia send as much as $300m (£230m) a year to Pyongyang, a critical source of foreign currency.In a sign of growing frustration, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, publicly warned Russia and China last week against weakening sanctions enforcement during a trip to Singapore.His plea came as a panel of UN experts tasked with monitoring sanctions implementations said Pyongyang had continued its nuclear and missiles programmes, and documented a host of violations including attempts to sell weapons to armed groups in Yemen and exporting more than $100m in textiles over a six-month period.North Korea “has not stopped its nuclear and missile programmes and continued to defy security council resolutions through a massive increase in illicit ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products, as well as through transfers of coal at sea during 2018”, the report said, according to a Reuters report.North Korean coal has even turned up at South Korean ports, which has long had a ban on products from the North.Amid the growing list of apparent sanctions violations, North Korea’s state-controlled media has begun calling for the US to drop the restrictions, saying its moratorium on missile and nuclear tests, the dismantling of its only known nuclear test site and the return of Korean war dead was enough.“There have been outrageous arguments coming out of the US state department that it won’t ease sanctions until a denuclearisation is completed, and reinforcing sanctions is a way to raise its negotiating power,” the Rodong Sinmun newspaper, a ruling Workers’ party mouthpiece, said in a front-page editorial. “How could the sanctions, which were a stick the US administration had brandished as part of its hostile policy against us, promote the two countries’ amity?”Several other North Korean outlets also criticised the pressure campaign as “anachronistic” and an obstacle to better relations. The complaints may be a sign sanctions are still a significant hurdle to trade or could merely be a negotiating tactic.“Maximum pressure has lost all steam,” added Jackson, now a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington. “One of the perverse consequences of the nuclear crisis last year was that nobody wanted a return to that precarious situation, and virtually everyone was willing to accept any outcome that assured we didn’t return to the brink of a nuclear war.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f29dde5c095b2082e6ac6a94f1e3bcc434787ef/0_106_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4d3102c1e9ccd68e5aee4efd55e11cb","title":"saudi arabia expels canadian ambassador for urging release of activists","story":"Riyadh halts fresh trade ties and accuses Ottawa of ‘blatant interference’ in its affairs Saudi Arabia has ordered the Canadian ambassador to leave the country and suspended new trade and investment with Ottawa after Canada’s foreign ministry urged Riyadh to release arrested civil rights activists.A statement released by the Saudi Press Agency said the foreign ministry gave the Canadian ambassador 24 hours to leave the country and recalled its own ambassador to Canada, adding it retained “its rights to take further action”.“The kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... will not accept interference in its internal affairs or imposed diktats from any country,” the foreign ministry tweeted.“The kingdom announces that it is recalling its ambassador ... to Canada for consultation.”“The Canadian position is an overt and blatant interference in the internal affairs of the Kingdom of #SaudiArabia and is in contravention of the most basic international norms and all the charters governing relations between States,” it tweeted. The statement came after the Canadian foreign ministry and the Canadian embassy urged the Saudi authorities to “immediately release” civil rights activists.“We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful \u001dhuman rights activists,” the Canadian embassy tweeted on Friday. Canadian foreign ministry officials were not available for an immediate comment on Sunday. Last Wednesday, Human Rights Watch said Saudi Arabia had arrested women’s rights activists Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sadah, the latest two to be swept up in a government crackdown on activists, clerics and journalists. More than a dozen women’s rights activists have been targeted since May. On Friday, Canada said it was “gravely concerned” about the arrests of civil society and women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia, including Badawi, the sister of jailed dissident blogger Raif Badawi. “We urge the Saudi authorities to immediately release them and all other peaceful human rights activists,” Global Affairs Canada said on its Twitter feed. Raif Badawi’s wife Ensaf Haidar lives in Canada and recently became a Canadian citizen. Most of those arrested campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the country’s male ship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions. The Saudi statement said it confirmed its commitment to refrain from intervening in the internal matters of other countries, including Canada, and in return rejected any intervention in its domestic affairs and internal relations with its citizens. “Any further step from the Canadian side in that direction will be considered as acknowledgment of our right to interfere in the Canadian domestic affairs,” the statement said.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587125.1533479877!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poolbeg incinerator firm to seek leave to burn more waste","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPoolbeg incinerator operator is to apply to An Bord Pleanála to take 15 per cent more waste than the plant’s current 600,000 tonne limit. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsThe operators of Dublin’s Poolbeg incinerator have confirmed they will seek permission this year to burn an additional 90,000 tonnes of waste annually at the plant.The plant’s managing director, John Daly, has now confirmed the firm will make an application to the board to take 15 per cent more waste than the incinerator’s current 600,000 tonne limit.Mr Daly said he hopes to be in a position to start processing the additional 90,000 tonnes of waste in 18 months’ time, and said there was an industry demand to burn 850,000 tonnes annually at the plant.A number of groups have criticised the expansion plan, including the Green Party, which said it was “incredibly short-sighted” and “would have a hugely negative affect on local residents”.Mr Daly said the additional 90,000 tonnes of waste could be accommodated within the existing plant without any need for a physical expansion.“We don’t need to make any changes to the plant,” he said. “We don’t need to change the physical structure, we don’t need to change anything internally, we don’t need to increase the hours of acceptance of waste.”Green Party councillor Claire Byrne said the increase would have an unacceptable effect on the local community.“Increasing capacity by 90,000 tonnes per annum will result in at least 18 extra trucks per day passing through residential areas.”However, Mr Daly said this was not the case. “We are currently taking in 90 trucks per day if we got an extra 15 per cent we would be at 105 trucks per day” but he said that would “still be well below the original figures”.The application for the incinerator, which was approved in 2007, 10 years before the incinerator opened, included a provision for 121 lorries delivering to the plant each day. However, with the plant currently operating at full capacity, an average of 90 trucks a day deliver waste to it, almost all of which come via the Port Tunnel, Mr Daly said.There had been “a lot of scaremongering” about trucks before operations began, he said. “It was continually in the papers about trucks clogging up Sandymount – no trucks come that way. They just don’t. They all come through the Port Tunnel, the only ones that are allowed come through that area are the ones collecting in that area.”Mr Daly also dismissed concerns the increase in capacity could result in increased pollution.“Independent tests show dioxin levels are consistently just 1.2 per cent of the permitted EU limits.”Tests had shown that the plant could cope with 690,000 tonnes annually, he said, but that this was probably the upper limit of its capacity.“In 2016 we went out and sought indications from the waste industry in relation to how much they would be interested in supplying us we got interest of 850,000 tonnes,” Mr Daly said.“I have people who want to bring more waste into us, and we can’t take it at the moment. We are going to take 600,000 tonnes this year and we could probably hit 800,000 tonnes if we had the capacity. We don’t have the capacity and the plant couldn’t do that.”The plant had a rocky start in June of last year with a lime leak resulting in 11 workers being hospitalised and the plant being shut down for several weeks. Earlier this year Covanta was fined €1,000 for a breach of its Environmental Protection Agency licence, in relation to a separate incident which also occurred in the first week of operations.However, Mr Daly said the public should have no concerns that it would be able to manage additional waste.“We’ve had very smooth operation for all of 2018. The emissions results are there and are transparent, there’s nothing hidden. We operate a very safe plant, a very efficient plant, and I think that we’ve shown over the last 12 months that to be the situation.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587092.1533477487!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"poolbeg incinerator s appetite for waste is a question of calories","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Poolbeg incinerator’s plume can appear red at night because of aviation warning lights on the chimney stacks. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillJohn Daly, managing director at Covanta Ireland, knows the Poolbeg incinerator, or waste-to-energy plant to give it its official title, is not the most popular kid on the block.“We get blamed for everything,” he says.Given who the other kids on the block are, it’s easy to see why he might think this unfair.“We are sitting here next to the waste water treatment plant, we’ve got two other power plants here, we’ve got a scrap yard across the road, but still, we get blamed for everything.”Specifically, he references a fly infestation last summer, described by some locals as “biblical”. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found “moderate fly numbers” in the waste intake building and bunker area, but Mr Daly says flies are not a new problem in the area. “It would be crazy to think we wouldn’t have flies, if everyone else in Ringsend and Irishtown had flies.”Other accusations levelled against the plant are completely without foundation, he says. “People see the white plume coming out of the stack and think it’s smoke. It’s just like a kettle, it’s just water vapour.”He says he finds this a more reasonable misconception than the flies, however.“We’ve even had a few calls from people saying there are flames coming out of the stack, and I’ve thought: ‘What is that person on?’” This, he says, is a visual effect caused by the red aviation lights on the chimney stacks making the white plume appear red at night. “It’s funny, I never thought about it until I saw it myself, and I see what people are saying . . . It actually does look like a flame.”More seriously, the plant has had some genuine failings to answer. A lime leak in the first week of operations resulted in 11 workers being hospitalised. “Any incident involving health safety is serious, but they’re all fine. They were all back working within a few days and they’ve all been compensated,” Mr Daly says.The EPA took legal action against the firm in relation to a separate incident in the first week of operation, when it failed to comply with the terms of its environmental licence during testing of the plant. Earlier this year Covanta was fined €1,000 for the breaches.However, one year on, these teething problems have been resolved and the plant is running safely and efficiently, Mr Daly says.Dioxin and furan levels are 98.8 per cent below the European Union permitted limits bottom ash, the main waste product left over after incineration is 16 per cent below what was predicted when planning permission was sought for the plant and the number of trucks delivering waste to the plant is also 25 per cent fewer than originally planned.Which all stacks up in favour of a potential expansion of the plant, but does not explain how the plant could go from taking in 600,000 tonnes to 690,000 tonnes of waste a year, without any need to physically expand the plant.The answer mainly lies, Mr Daly says in the “calorific value” of the waste that’s arriving at the plant.“The calorific value is about 10 per cent below what was originally envisaged. That is really because there’s been a very successful roll-out of the three-bin system in the intervening period,” he says. “The three-bin system has meant that paper and plastics, higher calorific value materials, are out of that system.”As with food, the calorific value of waste is the amount of energy it contains. In terms of incineration, the easiest way to understand its relevance is to relate it to a domestic hearth, EPA enforcement inspector Pat Byrne says.“If you put peat on an open fire it will burn more quickly than if you put coal on, and you’ll have to add more peat more often to keep the fire going – peat having a lower calorific value than coal.”The same theory can be applied to any fuel source, and for an incinerator waste is a fuel. “Different types of waste will have different calorific values, for example the more damp waste is the lower the calorific value. It’s basically to do with the amount of heat you get from any quantity of waste,” Mr Byrne says.Mr Daly hopes to make the planning application this year, with a view to getting an answer from the board in early 2019, ahead of the licence application to the EPA. If this process is successful, the company would hope to start taking the additional waste in 18 months’ time.“The fact there is no construction, the fact there is no requirement to change the hours, the fact we’re not going to look to take any hazardous material and the fact we are so much below the original forecasted impacts of both transport and emissions I think stands in our favour.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"New measure to allow Patrick Street operate as afternoon bus corridor will take time to bed in, caution Cork Business AssociationGarda\u0026iacute believe car was being driven wrong way down northbound lane at PortlaoiseByproduct could be valuable resource as material used in place of sand and gravelHospital says State may have to triple salary level to recruit leading obstetricians if it removes private practice from public hospitalsTotal numbers incarcerated on daily basis regularly breach 4,000Us waster firm Covanta hopes to take 90,000 tonnes of additional waste in 18 months\u0026rsquo timeWork on Mesolithic site shows \u0026lsquounprecedented\u0026rsquo insights into early Irish dietAuthors of report into period of disorder at children\u0026rsquos detention centre in 2016 speak outTD expresses concern that builders factoring help-to-buy scheme into \u0026lsquoinflationary\u0026rsquo priceCounselling body: \u0026lsquoThere are still many victims who do not yet feel they can come forward\u0026rsquoTaoiseach says move is necessary as part of climate change obligationsTourist guide to be produced to highlight challenges and steepness of slopes\u0026lsquoMysterious\u0026rsquo species thought to have been extinct in Britain and Ireland reappearsFamilies could find accommodation in a lovely beachside location for less than \u0026euro600Wounds serious, not life threatening \u0026ndash but garda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to altercationCause has not been identified but it is the latest in a series of gorse and vegetation firesSimon Harris tweets that religion \u0026lsquowill not determine\u0026rsquo health policy after Bishop of Elphin says contraceptive ban \u0026lsquoignored for too long\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587375.1533498876!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins declares fitness for another seven years at the %C3%A1ras","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins declined to say if he would be willing to publish his medical records. Photograph: James CrombieInphoPresident Michael D Higgins has insisted his “health is excellent” as his potential rivals said they would be open to publishing their medical records during the presidential election campaign.Independent Senator Pádraig Ó Céidigh has said he wants the medical records of all who will stand in the election released, a move businessman Gavin Duffy has said he would also be open to.Mr Ó Céidigh (61), the Aer Arann founder, has yet to decide if he will stand against Mr Higgins (77), who is seeking a second, seven-year term in Áras an Uachtaráin. Mr Duffy (58) is actively seeking a nomination from county councils.In order to get into the presidential race, a candidate needs 20 TDs or senators to sign their nomination papers or is required to secure the backing of four county councils.Mr Higgins on Sunday opened the 50th annual Birr Vintage Week and Arts Festival in Co Offaly. While he declined to say if he would be willing to publish his own medical records, the president insisted he was in good health.“My health is excellent, in fact everyone knows about it,” he said. “Seven years ago when I was contesting the election there was great attention paid to the fact that I had damaged my knee at Cruinniú na mBád.“After the inauguration on the 11th of November, the first Christmas, I got it repaired and by the middle of January I wasn’t even using a stick. There is a 110-degree bend in my knee now and the rest of my health as well is excellent.“No, no, he needn’t worry at all and I hope his own health is excellent,” he said of Mr Ó Céidigh’s request.“I don’t want to go into that kind of . . . there will be plenty of time for issues in the campaign when it starts but really, I don’t think it is where it is.“The campaign hasn’t started as far as I am concerned yet and when it does start what we really should be doing is concentrating on what the different candidates are offering the Irish people,” said Mr Higgins.“I never said that I was against having an election, quite the opposite indeed. I am very happy that we will have had an opportunity for letting the people make their choice and that is what is really important. The other stuff is really not of great importance.”Mr Duffy said he would be open to publishing his medical records if all candidates did so.Mr Ó Céidigh also said the Áras should publish Mr Higgins’s expenses over the past seven years.Áras an Uachtaráin and the presidency is not covered by freedom of information (FOI) legislation, but Mr Ó Céidigh said such spending details should be published in the interests of transparency.Mr Duffy said that while he favoured opening up the post to FOI – aside from correspondence to and from the president – he doesn’t believe Mr Higgins should “retrospectively” publish all such details.If elected, however, Mr Duffy said he would publish his own spending as a matter of course.In an interview with the Sunday Business Post, Mr Duffy confirmed he had helped businessman Denis O’Brien prepare for media interviews following the publication of the Moriarty Tribunal report.The tribunal concluded it was “beyond doubt” that Michel Lowry had, as minister for communications, given “substantive information to Denis O’Brien of significant value and assistance to him in securing” a mobile telephone licence in the mid-1990s. He declined to provide further details.Mr Duffy says he fully accepts the findings of the tribunal. Mr O’Brien has rejected its findings.Mr Duffy also said he briefly met the former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank, Seán FitzPatrick, but decided he could do nothing to help Mr FitzPatrick."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3587179.1533500634!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mcdonald restates sinn f%C3%A9in stance on unity poll after u turn","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald (at centre in green top) in procession during the 37th National Hunger Strike Commemoration in Castlewellan, Co Down, on Sunday.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireIt is now only a matter of “when” a Border poll will take place on Irish unity, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald said on Sunday, as she brushed aside her U-turn on the issue last week.Speaking at an event to commemorate the 1981 hunger strikes in Co Down, she spoke of republicanism being “renewed and revitalised” and said “the need for a referendum to end partition is writ large”.Last week, in an interview, Ms McDonald said the Border poll question should be put to one side until the “dangers” posed by Brexit were mitigated.But the following day, she declared there would have to be a Border poll if the UK crashed out of the European Union next year without an agreement.Opponents claimed she had been pressurised within the party to change tact, a claim denied by Sinn Féin, which argued that her comments were consistent.Addressing the republican crowd on Sunday, Ms McDonald said: “The time for a unity referendum is drawing near . . . It is not a question of if a unity referendum will happen but a question of when.“As Britain turns away from Europe, the appeal of being part of a new and outward-looking Ireland will, I believe, prove ever more attractive to some within the unionist community.”She added that British identity must be accommodated in a united Ireland and said unionists had the right “to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experience and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be respected”.She also said republicans’ “right to remember, commemorate, to honour our dead must be respected”.Thousands of republicans gathered in Castlewellan for the 37th “National Hunger Strike Commemoration”, the first time it has been held in Co Down, marking the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh, in 1981.The theme of Sunday’s commemorative parade through the town to a private landowner’s field, where Ms McDonald addressed the crowd, was “the journey”.In the field, stalls were selling republican-themed merchandise, including badges, books, CDs, jerseys, aprons and portraits of the late former first minster and ex-IRA chief Martin McGuinness. Rebel tunes played as young men played with hurleys and children played on the grass on their bicycles.When the parade arrived in the field South Down MP Chris Hazzard opened proceedings by thanking the families of the “patriot dead” hunger strikers for attending.South Down MLA Emma Rogan recited the poem What Compels Young Men to Die? before Cllr John Rice, who was referred to by a party colleague as a “POW”, read “our role of honour” to the hunger strikers.Young people were then involved in a New Ireland theatre piece called The Jigsaw. Each of the 32 had carried a large jigsaw piece of their county in the parade and then in the field they were added to a giant map of Ireland while information about notable republicans was read out.Ms McDonald then paid tribute to the hunger strikers, saying: “We will not let them be criminalised ever.”Ahead of the commemoration, families of victims of IRA violence said the event was “insulting” to their relatives memories and UUP representative Alan Lewis claimed Sinn Féin was “glorifying” terrorism.Among those to disagree with this claim was Noel Connolly, chair of Sinn Féin’s Grey Abbey Martyrs cumann, Kildare South. “We come here every year just to recognise sacrifice,” he said.“We recognise that a lot of people died in the conflict but everyone has the right to remember their dead, including loyalists and everyone else.”When former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams – who was mobbed in the field by republicans young and old for joint-selfies and photographs – was asked by a reporter at Stormont in 2016 when he would like to see a Border poll he replied “Yesterday”, and that was the feeling among many others in Castlewellan.A 51 per cent win would be “a shame but we would obviously accept it, but we would like to persuade people and that will be done by selling the benefits of unity,” Mr Connolly said."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Revealed: The least punctual airlines flying from BritainSocial media is making children regress to mentality of three-year-olds, says top brain scientistJoël Robuchon: \u0026#39Chef of the Century\u0026#39 dies of cancer after spending final years on fat and sugar-free dietCocaine deaths reach all-time high in England and WalesJudge at Ben Stokes affray trial asks potential jurors to declare if they are cricket fansMidwife \u0026#39murder\u0026#39: Husband of Samantha Eastwood\u0026#39s ex-fiance\u0026#39s sister remanded in custody over deathSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador over call to free women\u0026#39s rights activists\u0026#39Unrepresented\u0026#39 right-wing policies give chance for Ukip resurgence, poll showsFive dead as plane crashes into shopping centre car park in CaliforniaLabour in a \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 over anti-Semitism, says senior MPOil drilling must be halted in Surrey after mysterious swarm of earthquakes, scientists sayPolice hunt reckless motorist who bragged about his \u0026#39stolen car\u0026#39 while threatening to mow down cyclistsNorth Korea declares heatwave \u0026#39unprecedented natural disaster\u0026#39 as South resorts to \u0026#39ice vests\u0026#39Indonesia earthquake: At least 91 dead as tourists evacuated after \u0026#39massive\u0026#39 damageThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutDonald Trump admits son met Russian to get information on Hillary ClintonDemi Lovato vows to \u0026#39keep fighting\u0026#39 in first statement about suspected overdoseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

sicknesscould wipe nine 10 britains horses reaches","story":"African Horse Sickness (AHS) is dubbed the ‘Armageddon’ of animal diseasesA deadly disease which could wipe out nine in 10 of Britain’s horses could reach UK shores as the climate warms, experts fear.African Horse Sickness (AHS) which is dubbed the ‘Armageddon’ of animal diseases because it has a 95 per cent mortality rate would be utterly devastating to Britain’s £7 billion equine industry because UK horses have no natural immunity. Even if animals were not infected, 60 mile protection zones around stricken stables would effectively put and end to eventing, racing, showing of horses and leisure riding, according to the British Horse Society.Although there has not been an outbreak in Europe since 1990 in Spain, vets fear that the warming climate and lack of biosecurity measures by importers could allow the disease to move northwards.The midge which spreads AHS is already in Britain, and there have been recent UK outbreaks of bluetongue in sheep which is related to the AHS virus, proving that it could exist in our climate. Experts also fear that infected insects could accidentally travel on commercial aircraft into the country or be blown across from the continent if the disease emerged in Europe again. African horse sickness | Signs of African horse sickness may include:World Horse Welfare Chief Executive, Roly Owers, said: “Exotic disease does present a real risk for the UK’s horse population, and African Horse Sickness (AHS) is certainly the ‘Armageddon’ of diseases due to its extremely high fatality rate plus the fact there is currently no effective vaccine.“There is a real need for UK horse owners to improve biosecurity which is a vital tool in helping to control all diseases.”Defra currently views the current risk of AHS reaching the UK as very low and horses exported from Africa are subjected to stringent testing and a lengthy quarantine process, and in the UK we have a specific regulation and control strategy for AHS should an outbreak occur.However Mr Owers warned that not all owners and breeders were taking the necessary precautions to prevent disease entering Britain.  “Early results from a survey undertaken by the Equine Disease Coalition show that many horse owners are not undertaking even the most basic biosecurity measures, such as isolation procedures for new arrivals, and this is a real cause for concern,” he said.Over the last 50 years, outbreaks of AHS outside of Africa have occurred in the Middle East, India, Pakistan, Spain (mid- 1960’s and 1987-90) and Portugal (1989)..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and

prevented from spreadingThe British Horse SocietyAfrican Horse Sickness now forms part of the police’s Exotic Animal Disease guidelines, alongside swine fever, west nile virus, bird flu and foot \u0026amp mouth.Gail Sprake, Chair of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust said: “Many of Britain’s rare horse breeds are already in danger of dying out, and there is now the added threat of diseases like African Horse Sickness. These are worrying times for all British horses.”In guidance issued for owners and breeders, The British Horse Society warned owners to be on the look out for the virus. “With climate change and an increase in the international movement of horses there is a possibility that AHS could reach Britain, although the risk is not presently considered to be high,” said the BHS.“However, were AHS to arrive on these shores it is imperative that it is spotted quickly in order that it can be dealt with rapidly and prevented from spreading.“It is possible that an AHS outbreak could occur in the UK if the virus were to be imported and, given the severe welfare and economic consequences of AHS, this would have devastating consequences to the naïve UK equine population.”There is currently no good vaccine against the disease. The main vaccine, which is not licensed in Europe, has in some cases actually caused outbreaks of the disease in AfricaThe Equine Disease Coalition, which was established in 2011 to prevent outbreaks in Britain, is currently working towards an improved vaccine.Please review our commenting policyRevealed: The least punctual airlines flying from BritainSocial media is making children regress to mentality of three-year-olds, says top brain scientistJoël Robuchon: \u0026#39Chef of the Century\u0026#39 dies of cancer after spending final years on fat and sugar-free dietCocaine deaths reach all-time high in England and WalesJudge at Ben Stokes affray trial asks potential jurors to declare if they are cricket fansMidwife \u0026#39murder\u0026#39: Husband of Samantha Eastwood\u0026#39s ex-fiance\u0026#39s sister remanded in custody over deathSaudi Arabia expels Canadian ambassador over call to free women\u0026#39s rights activists\u0026#39Unrepresented\u0026#39 right-wing policies give chance for Ukip resurgence, poll showsFive dead as plane crashes into shopping centre car park in CaliforniaLabour in a \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 over anti-Semitism, says senior MPOil drilling must be halted in Surrey after mysterious swarm of earthquakes, scientists sayPolice hunt reckless motorist who bragged about his \u0026#39stolen car\u0026#39 while threatening to mow down cyclistsNorth Korea declares heatwave \u0026#39unprecedented natural disaster\u0026#39 as South resorts to \u0026#39ice vests\u0026#39Indonesia earthquake: At least 91 dead as tourists evacuated after \u0026#39massive\u0026#39 damageThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutDonald Trump admits son met Russian to get information on Hillary ClintonDemi Lovato vows to \u0026#39keep fighting\u0026#39 in first statement about suspected overdoseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/05/TELEMMGLPICT000170439531_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJbpkim5O2cLltz83iBU_Lm06G4WsE6soR9GtM8tEs-o.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"can learn walking life putting one foot front","story":"To promenade is to enjoy life Hiking, ambling, strolling, rambling – there is nothing we Brits like better than a nice walk.

Turns out I just needed to go walking in Leytonstone instead.RSPCA inspector Rebecca Bedson said: “We received a call yesterday morning reporting a stray snake in High Road, Leytonstone.

His wife, Ensaf Haidar, is now living in Canada.Marie-Pier Baril, a spokeswoman for Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, said they were seriously concerned by Saudi Arabia\u0027s actions.Canada will always stand up for the protection of human rights, very much including women\u0027s rights, and freedom of expression around the world, she said in a statement. Our government will never hesitate to promote these values and believes that this dialogue is critical to international diplomacy.Almost immediately after the news, Saudi Twitter accounts began tweeting similarly phrased messages of their “concern” for Canada\u0027s own treatment of First Nation members and the need for Quebec to gain independence.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been praised for pushing through reforms in recent months, which include lifting the ban on women driving in the kingdom.However, more than a dozen prominent rights activists were arrested before the day came in June and accused of illegal contact with foreign entities.Analysts said the decision to expel Canada\u0027s ambassador was likely to have been taken by the Saudi government to send the message that while the once-closed kingdom is beginning to open up to the world it will not tolerate criticism on its human rights.“No one should interpret this as a tantrum from Riyadh,” said H A Hellyer, senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council and the Royal United Services Institute in London.“It is far more likely to be a calculated move, designed to establish a new litmus test internationally for continued relations with Saudi Arabia. The question is whether or not everyone will buckle - or refuse.”The diplomatic move may be part of the crown prince\u0027s aggressive foreign policy, which since his father took the throne in 2015 has seen Saudi intervene in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen and pressure Lebanon’s prime minister into resigning.Canada has also previously criticised Riyadh for its blockade in war-torn Yemen, which left millions on the brink of starvation.Germany similarly has found itself targeted by the kingdom in recent months over comments by its officials on the Saudi-led war.It is not immediately clear what new business could be affected between Canada and Saudi Arabia.Some 10 per cent of Canadian crude oil imports come from Saudi Arabia.Bilateral trade between the two nations reached $3 billion in 2016, with tanks and fighting vehicles among the top Canadian exports to the kingdom, according to government statistics.Saudi is the Canadian defence industry\u0027s biggest client outside of the United States.Revealed: The least punctual airlines flying from BritainSocial media is making children regress to mentality of three-year-olds, says top brain scientistJoël Robuchon: \u0026#39Chef of the Century\u0026#39 dies of cancer after spending final years on fat and sugar-free dietCocaine deaths reach all-time high in England and WalesJudge at Ben Stokes affray trial asks potential jurors to declare if they are cricket fansMidwife \u0026#39murder\u0026#39: Husband of Samantha Eastwood\u0026#39s ex-fiance\u0026#39s sister remanded in custody over death\u0026#39Unrepresented\u0026#39 right-wing policies give chance for Ukip resurgence, poll showsFive dead as plane crashes into shopping centre car park in CaliforniaLabour in a \u0026#39mess\u0026#39 over anti-Semitism, says senior MPOil drilling must be halted in Surrey after mysterious swarm of earthquakes, scientists sayPolice hunt reckless motorist who bragged about his \u0026#39stolen car\u0026#39 while threatening to mow down cyclistsNorth Korea declares heatwave \u0026#39unprecedented natural disaster\u0026#39 as South resorts to \u0026#39ice vests\u0026#39Indonesia earthquake: At least 91 dead as tourists evacuated after \u0026#39massive\u0026#39 damageThe 8 things you might have missed this weekendEleven children in US rescued from \u0026#39extremists\u0026#39 at \u0026#39filthy\u0026#39 hideoutDonald Trump admits son met Russian to get information on Hillary ClintonDemi Lovato vows to \u0026#39keep fighting\u0026#39 in first statement about suspected overdoseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/30/15/rts1lw71.jpg","title":"brexit financial centres city of london frankfurt dublin paris luxembourg financial services banking","story":"Created with Sketch.It isn\u0027t just a question of tax and regulation as bosses weigh up where to go. Their choice has to be somewhere that has the people they need, and can be counted on to attract themClick to followThe Independent OnlineLondon\u0027s financial centre is the world\u0027s number one, but Brexit could knock it off its perch“I mean Dusseldorf? Why on earth would I want to move to Dusseldorf?”This was the appalled reaction of a banker friend of mine in reaction to the prospect of being relocated to the German city as a result of the Conservative Party’s lunatic hard Brexit.In case you hadn’t noticed, the latter is delivering a gut punch to a part of the British economy that exported a world-leading £77bn of services, and contributed £72.1bn in tax to the UK exchequer in 2017.In the absence of a miracle, London’s world-leading financial centre is set to emerge much diminished from what has been going on, with banks and other financial institutions actively setting up subsidiaries in EU countries so they can continue to do business in the event of the UK tipping over a cliff. They will be ready even if the country is not.But which of the rivals vying for London’s business will emerge as the winner?And how will its workers feel about relocation there? That’s something banks have to take into account, dealing as they are with highly qualified, and mobile, personnel.My banker friend’s dismay at the prospect of his particular business unit relocating to Dusseldorf wasn’t entirely fair.Mercer, a consultant, regularly looks at the quality of life offered by the world’s cities. It rated the capital of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as one of the 10 best places to live in the world, and the fourth best in Europe. Dusseldorf has held that exalted status for more than a decade, too.It’s clean, civilised, has a fine academy of arts, and is the birthplace of the mighty Kraftwerk, the pioneering electronic music band.While it doesn’t merit a place in ZYen’s global financial centre index, there is a respectable enough financial services industry there, the employees of which have much to be thankful for.But, of course, it isn’t London.The capital of Britain limps in at a dismal 41st when it comes to the annual quality of life rankings compiled by Mercer, a consultancy firm. However, it is one of only a handful of cosmopolitan, truly global cities. It might have its warts, it occasionally drives those of us that live here up the wall, but many of its residents would be loath\u0026nbspto live anywhere else. After all, as the saying goes, “If you’re tired of London, you’re tired of life.”Is that something that you could say about Frankfurt, or Hamburg, or Luxembourg? Or even Dusseldorf?Nonetheless, a number of those working in financial services are having to resign themselves to the prospect of relocating to one or other of them.The exodus the Leave campaign said wouldn’t happen is under way. The numbers have been relatively small to date. But they are expected to rise rapidly over the coming months, especially if the UK crashes out without a deal, as seems increasingly likely.The trouble is, all of London’s rivals come with significant drawbacks.The ZYen index has only one other EU financial centre in its top 20. That would be Frankfurt, which still fell nine places in the latest report. Although its overall points rating ticked up a bit, others overtook it.However, it looks as if Frankfurt and its rivals are set to climb over the coming years, if only because of the one big advantage they all have over London: their host countries are governed by more or less sensible people.The German city has long fancied itself as London’s chief European rival.However, it should be noted that, according to the TheCityUK, Britain’s capital employs nearly 800,000 people in its financial centre, more than actually live within Frankfurt’s administrative boundaries, and about a third of the population of the urban area as a whole.Nonetheless, Frankfurt has been on a charge. Its most recent victory came courtesy of Deutsche Bank, which shifted a large part of its euro clearing activity to the city. The gesture was a largely symbolic one (it was done with the flip of a switch), but it was nonetheless seen as a victory for a campaign by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Borse to grab a larger slice of what is a lucrative market.One of the biggest knocks on Frankfurt is that it has something of a reputational issue.When City types declare that they’re going to visit the home of both the European Central Bank and Germany’s Bundesbank, it’s not uncommon for them to get an “oh dear, poor you” in response.\u0026nbsp“I know,” goes the typical reply, “but I’ll be back before the weekend.”The city is aware of the issue.“Frankfurt is an amazing city to live in (and visit), especially for young, successful professionals,” gushed an email from Frankfurt Main Finance, which serves as the voice of its financial centre in a similar way\u0026nbspto the TheCityUK for London.It continued: “However, the city is often overlooked by journalists and has a reputation for being provincial. This is something we would like to change.”On offer was an opportunity to sample the World Club Dome weekend, billed as “the world’s biggest club event with an international DJ line-up” and boasting 700,000 square metres of dance floors. Yah boo sucks to anyone who calls us provincial!There’s also a museum devoted to electronic music (something Germany does extremely well – it’s not just Kraftwerk) and more besides.Still, a recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers into the UK’s financial and professional services industries looked at London’s main rivals couldn’t resist noting that while Frankfurt compares favourably to the UK capital in terms of its low crime and enviably high quality of life, it “has less cultural appeal than London or Paris”.The same report went on to note that: “German authorities and regulators are seen as predictable, but not particularly flexible or innovation-friendly. There are restrictive labour laws and high taxes.”One problem that Frankfurt doesn’t have: English is the language of international finance and Germany’s great financial institutions have no problem with using it (if you’re English and feeling embarrassed about that now you wouldn’t be alone).Just a tick below Frankfurt, and scoring a top 20 rating in the Mercer quality of life index (18th position globally), is Luxembourg, the tiny, landlocked Grand Duchy, sandwiched between Belgium, Germany and Austria. What we’re actually talking about here, however, is the capital, which also goes by the name of Luxembourg.The place has long enjoyed a reputation for low taxes, to the extent that that European Commission has been investigating some of the deals struck with internet companies such as Amazon in recent years.When it comes to financial services, it has established a reputation as a leading centre for asset management, hosting the second largest investment fund market globally, together with one of Europe’s largest private banking markets.The place has also benefited from longstanding social and political stability, which has supported its development as an international financial hub.PwC praises “its modern and continuously updated legal and regulatory framework”. They have “supported the development of specific sectors”, for example, alternative investment funds, venture capital funds and international pension funds.It also hails the “regular and close collaboration between the government, regulators and private sector, which has contributed to its success”.The tax and regulatory systems are also seen as ultra stable. On the flipside, it might not be seen as the most exciting place to live, and its population is less than that of Ipswich. So it doesn’t have the sort of “cluster effect” that makes it relatively easy for big institutions to get the qualified staff they need in the really large financial centres.Like London, Paris is a world city. You couldn’t imagine anyone saying “oh God, not there” at the prospect of being relocated to the city of lights even if Mercer has it in only 39th position as regards the qualify of life on offer there (two spots above the UK capital).The disadvantage with the place was summed up by one financial services manager of my acquaintance: “It’s the sort of place to take your lover for a romantic weekend, but not the sort of place you’d go to set up a business.”A lot of people in City circles have talked only half-jokingly of worrying whether any work would get done if they relocated there.Just like the perception of Frankfurt being terminally dull, that’s probably an exaggeration and not entirely fair.Paris has an entirely legitimate financial centre that has enjoyed some success.But it has likely factored into bosses’ thinking all the same.According to PwC’s assessment, the place has traditionally been focussed on domestic banking, but “it is also developing a leading position in investment management and corporate bond issuance within Europe”.It notes that France’s regulatory authorities are attempting to become more responsive, “but are not perceived to be as market or innovation-friendly as some other regulators”. Another criticism is the “difficulty of interaction with the tax authorities”, along with “high corporate and personal tax rates, restrictive labour laws and limited use of English”. The latter is not a problem for Dublin or Frankfurt, or even Hamburg.France is trying to work on some of these, up to and including offering conditional tax incentives to draw people in.Not an option that has been much discussed, Hamburg is actually where Germany’s first exchange and its first privately owned financial institution (Berenberg Bank) were founded. Today it boasts a stock exchange, a banking sector that employs 25,000 people, Germany’s third largest insurance centre and a sizeable fintech hub. As far as pros and cons go, they’re similar to Frankfurt’s, although as the main centre the latter would be the first choice of many.As a place to live it ranks 19th in Mercer’s rankings, in which German cities do very well as a rule. It’s also the home of FC St Pauli, the cult football club famed for the left-leaning character of its supporters. A trip there is probably not the sort of ersion that would find favour with bankers on the lookout for something to do of a weekend.Dublin has a lot going for it, both as a place to live and to do business. It boasts the sort of low tax regime judged to be “business friendly”,\u0026nbsp for which read “low” (and how), not to mention its favourable rates of personal taxation for higher earners.It’s a lot smaller than London, or Paris, but the City has plenty of attractions all the same. You aren’t likely to hear many complaints from people asked to spend a few days away there.In terms of “quality of life”, it’s in the same ball park as London and Paris, at number 34.The traffic, in particular, can be murder and is forecast to rise quite rapidly over the coming years. Meanwhile, the  recently complained that the City’s once legendary nightlife is “disintegrating”.PwC’s report praises its strong reputation in back office fund management operations, and insurance, but criticises its less developed capital markets (stock exchanges and the like). The local financial sector is large relative to the economy but PwC says that the financial centre has “less breadth” than its rivals. “This is reflected in the current focus and capabilities of the regulator.”There may also be a perception that it is some way away from the centre of the European action due to its geographic position.Its strong technology sector is seen as a big advantage, and the government there has cannily sought to make the nation “Brexit-ready”. There is also a tax relief programme to support foreign companies in relocating staff.The investment fund set up by arch Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg and his old Etonian chums can certainly testify to the attractions of the place, having set up an\u0026nbspoffice there and started launching product out of it.

They are either too small, too niche, or too domestically focussed to truly rival London, and the quality of regulation could be seen as an issue with some.With London becoming less attractive, a lot of American banks have simply shifted their operations back home. Asian centres are also set to gobble up bits of business.There is, all the same, still a lot to gain for everyone in Europe’s rival financial centres as London’s star diminishes.

PGT works on the principle that negative pregnancies and miscarriages can be minimised by screening these abnormal embryos before they’re implanted.While NHS\u0026nbspclinics screen for genetic diseases PGT is not routinely offered, however the increasing postcode lottery for patients as cash-strapped regions cut funding for IVF cycles means many more people use private services.It is just one of a range of add-on (adjuvant) therapies and tests which clinics say are necessary to achieve the best results.However The Independent has revealed how UK fertility watchdogs are highly suspicious of inflated success rates being advertised to UK couples, which some overseas groups claim are as high as 98 per cent.“All too often couples requiring IVF treatment are taken for a ride when it comes to a bewildering array of unproven tests and adjuvant treatments,” said Professor Jan Brosens, an obstetrics and gynaecology expert at the University of Warwick, who was not involved in the study.“This smartly designed and well conducted study was designed to give couples clear-cut information on whether PGT-A increases the chance of having a baby within one year.The study, which followed 396 women across nine fertility centres in seven countries, randomly allocated half the participants have either abnormality screening through PGT, or just IVF.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders.

They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data. Demand for nurses was 19 per cent higher between July and September 2017 than the same period two years ago.1250 Malnutrition deaths in hospitals in England and Wales at highest level for a decadeThe number of people dying in hospital as a result of malnutrition has hit its highest level for a decade, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.The number of women who had a live birth within 12 months of the study was identical in both groups, at 24 per cent. It did find that women who had PGT screening were significantly less likely to have a miscarriage and this may be enough to sway some couples.\u0026nbsp“Many IVF clinics may well erroneously seize this as a ‘selling point’ for PGT-A,” said professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Southampton, Ying Cheong, who was not involved in the study.“It needs to be emphasised that these are secondary end-points which the study was not powered to definitively answer and so must be interpreted with caution.She said biopsies of embryos for PGT if there was no evidence it worked “is poor clinical practice”, adding: “We still do not understand fully the developmental biology of the egg and the embryo, and as such, may cause more harm than good.“For these reasons, it is my opinion that PGT-A should not be offered to women with advanced maternal age.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/12/12/mark-billingham-1.jpg","title":"long reads hero sas who dares wins culture tv marvel","story":"Created with Sketch.Is he a Marvel-esque superhuman or an SAS daredevil? Or is he Ed Sheeran? Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?T.E Lawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

shoppers animal welfare farms","story":"Created with Sketch.Exclusive: New campaign planned for law to force meat and dairy food firms to state whether animals were kept in cruel conditionsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBernard Matthews turkey and chicken products, as seen on the company website, depict the outdoors with trees, plants and a tractorFood brands Dairylea and Bernard Matthews have been accused of potentially misleading shoppers\u0026nbspwith\u0026nbsplabelling that suggests the animals used spent their lives outdoors.The makers of the processed cheese and turkey products are among many\u0026nbspcompanies said to be giving shoppers an\u0026nbspimpression of high animal-welfare standards with pictures\u0026nbspof fields or happy cows,\u0026nbspor by using terms such as “grass-fed”, “farm fresh”, “butcher’s choice” and “all natural”, but in reality, it is not always clear what conditions their animals are kept in.Opponents of factory farming made the claims as they prepared to launch a campaign for a new law forcing food companies to label all meat and dairy products with the method of production.Experts believe that of all the animals raised in the UK each year for food, more than 70 per cent are factory-farmed – raised behind closed shed doors and out of public view.Campaigning charity Compassion in World Farming highlighted how Dairylea triangles and strings depict cows on the box in green fields with blue skies.And it said Bernard Matthews turkey pieces, slices and steaks all come in packaging suggesting the outdoors, with a tractor or gates to a field.Yet growing numbers of dairy cows in Britain are kept indoors, and an estimated nine in 10 of the 18 million turkeys in Britain are reared entirely indoors with no freedom to run around in fresh air and daylight.The group also highlighted other examples, such as the packaging on certain brands of sausages that show fields and trees.There is nothing in law to oblige supermarkets or food firms to show on meat and dairy labels how the animals were reared, and definitions of terms such as “grass-fed” vary between products.\u0026nbspCampaigners said\u0026nbspit means that shoppers are buying intensively farmed meat and dairy products without realising it – and many would choose to buy higher welfare items if given the full picture.What the logos meanRed Tractor, the food industry’s\u0026nbspscheme, allows cows to be kept indoors all year and sows to be confined during farrowing (giving birth) in crates where they cannot move aroundThe Free Range Dairy Network requires

and free-range access with shade and shelterSean Gifford, from Compassion in World Farming, said it would be almost impossible to distinguish low- and high-welfare from the packaging on two products sitting side by side.He told The Independent: “There’s a sea of misleading labels out there keeping consumers in the dark through their wording, pictures of bucolic scenes and suggestions.\u0026nbspBut in reality animals are kept indoors in intensive systems: cows never feel grass under their feet and chickens never fly.“On\u0026nbspDairylea, for instance, there’s no indication of the conditions the cows are kept in. But we know a growing percentage are kept indoors in Britain and never experience sunlight on their backs or grass under their feet.\u0026nbspBernard Matthews labels show the countryside with green grass but the reality of life for their turkeys is probably anything but outdoors. We suspect they are raised intensively because the company doesn\u0027t participate in any assurance schemes.He added: “If consumers could see behind closed doors they’d be shocked.\u0026nbspIf a pig is kept intensively all its life – with mother sows unable to even turn around to interact with her young – shoppers should be told.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspbrands we\u0027ve highlighted are just the tip of the iceberg - there are many out there with misleading labels.​CiWF is about to launch a petition calling on the government to make it compulsory for food firms to state the method of production on labels.“Labels on intensively reared products frequently display misleading images of rolling landscapes and happy animals, when in reality the livestock are crammed into barren cages, kept indoors all their lives or kept in such close confinement that they are unable to express their natural behaviours,” Bronwen Reinhardt, honest labelling campaign manager at CiWF.Misleading slogans and images undermine farmers who genuinely operate to high welfare standards, she said.Earlier this year the environment department (Defra) ran a public consultation on the future of food and farming after Brexit, with a document that said: “It is not always clear to the consumer what standards underpin welfare terminology and definitions on labels, such as ‘grass-fed’, can vary between retailers. We are considering whether providing greater clarity of information to consumers could support higher welfare production.”In a speech in January, environment secretary Michael Gove said: “I want us, outside the European Union, to develop new approaches to food labelling… there’s still no single, scaled, measure of how a farmer or food producer performs against a sensible basket of indicators, taking into account such things as soil health, control of pollution, contribution to water quality as well as animal welfare.“We’ve been in discussion with farmers and food producers about how we might advance such a scheme and I think that, outside the EU, we could establish a measure of farm and food quality which would be world-leading.”More appropriate slogans would be ‘raised in confinement’ or ‘grown quickly without access to the outdoors’Mr Gifford said what’s needed is a system similar to that introduced for eggs in 2004 that made production method labelling compulsory, after which free-range and organic egg sales “went through the roof”.Mandatory production and slaughter method labelling was one policy Labour promised in its 50-point animal-welfare plan published in February.As milk prices have fallen in recent years, under-pressure farmers have moved towards more intensive systems, building vast sheds packed with dairy cows who are fed not on grass but on protein-heavy diets to boost milk production.Research by World Animal Protection has found Britain now has about 100 industrial “mega-farms”, each housing up to 3,000 cows that are kept permanently indoors.CiWF)Many farms keep cattle indoors some of the time and allow them outdoors at other times.But some have estimated that all “zero-grazing” systems – accused of causing painful lameness and mastitis because cows stand on concrete floors for prolonged periods – are in place in one in five British dairy farms.\u0026nbspAccording to Labelling Matters, a coalition of groups lobbying since 2011 for a law on production method labelling, such a step would benefit not just shoppers and farm animals but farmers too, creating a level playing field for them.A spokeswoman for Mondelez, which owns the Dairylea brand, said: “The farmers that supply to us graze their cows whenever weather conditions and location allows, and wherever this is appropriate and manageable from their perspective.\u0026nbspTherefore, it is not practical or possible for us to guarantee that 100 per cent of the cows providing our milk can graze 100 per cent of the time.\u0026nbsp“Ensuring that suppliers take good care of their herds is fundamental to ensuring our cheeses are made with high-quality milk. The environment in which the cows are kept is a key part of that and protecting them from physical and thermal discomfort, fear and distress is a priority for our suppliers.”The Independent has asked the Two Sisters Food Group, owner of the Bernard Matthews brand, for a comment but had not received one at the time of publication.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with

homes.Yet developers and housing groups say the selective release of some greenfield sites within the green belt is needed to solve the nation’s acute shortage of housing.Some experts have argued that large parts of the green belt are unproductive – without any special interest or agricultural value.Last month the government issued an updated national planning policy framework, rejecting calls for a complete ban on building in green belt zones.The CPRE said one third of local authorities with green belt land would now be\u0026nbspgiven increased housing targets because of the government’s new method for calculating housing demand.The group warned the biggest push to build would come in the green belt surrounding London.Trailmix: Take to the paths of Sherwood on a SegwayWild hide: Stayfari

eroded at an alarming rate,” said Fyans.“But it is essential, if the green belt is to fulfil its main purposes and provide 30 million of us with access to the benefits of the countryside, that the redevelopment of brownfield land is prioritised, and green belt protection strengthened.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said only 0.02 per cent of the green belt was developed for residential use last year.“We are clear that building the homes our country needs does not mean tearing up our countryside,” said a spokesman.“We are adding more certainty to the planning system and our new planning rulebook strengthens national protections for the green belt, and says that councils may only alter boundaries in exceptional circumstances once they have looked

Independent OnlineCampaigners have fought against a universal credit roll-out beset by problemsUniversal credit\u0026nbspclaimants are losing out on hundreds of pounds a year because of the system’s failure to understand when and how people are getting paid, a leading charity has warned.The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) said\u0026nbspone in 20 cases analysed by its early warning system, which uses evidence from welfare rights advisers to identify issues, were hit by problems with the monthly assessment system.For working claimants whose payday falls at\u0026nbspthe “wrong” time of the month, or\u0026nbsptoo close their universal credit assessment date,\u0026nbspthe impact on how much they receive is significant, a report from the charity said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDomestic abuse risk posed by universal credit overhaul, MPs warnUniversal credit forces people into debt due to complex processesMcVey accused of still misleading MPs over universal creditCorbyn ignores universal credit row to attack May on bus policyProblems can arise from the\u0026nbspsystem over-calculating\u0026nbspthe earnings of those\u0026nbsppaid on a four-weekly basis, simply because two paydays can fall within one calendar month.Being paid early as a result of weekends or bank holidays can also make it look like a worker has earned more because they receive two payments in a month.Back pay and tax rebates can also trigger the problem, the charity warned.“Universal credit isn\u0027t working for working people,” said Alison\u0026nbspGarnham,\u0026nbspCPAG\u0026nbspchief executive. “In the worst cases, people are losing out on significant amounts of money – hundreds of pounds over the course of a year – simply because of when their paydays and assessment periods fall.“But we believe most of the problems created by the monthly assessment system can be fixed relatively easily if the political will is there.”CPAG called for reforms to the system, including allowing claimants to change the date of their assessments\u0026nbspso they do not clash with paydays.“The mass migration of families on to universal credit should not begin until these fundamental problems are resolved,” Ms Garnham said.Life on the poverty line: Breadline BritainThe government’s flagship welfare reform has been beset with difficulties since it was first introduced in 2013.When the plan for universal credit was first announced, it was sold as a way of simplifying\u0026nbspthe UK’s benefit system.It was supposed to be sophisticated enough to adjust to people’s changing earnings in real time, but Ms Garham said the system operates using a “huge oversimplification” which is failing to reflect the reality of people’s lives.Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said it was “wrong” for working people to be losing out\u0026nbspbecause of ongoing flaws in the system.“This is causing chaos as this report starkly highlights,” he said. “The government has created this mess and it needs fixing quickly.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman responded: “We are listening to stakeholders’ concerns and working on issues regarding payment cycles and we will consider this report carefully.”Enter your

All of this will bind the hands of a future Labour government, and will make it far harder for us to deliver on our promises.”It says Labour must “oppose any Brexit deal that does not satisfy Labour’s six\u0026nbsptests” and instead “call for an immediate general election, and make a manifesto commitment to call a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain in the EU if the public rejects it”.Leading scientists back call for Brexit deal voteMore than 500,000 back The Independent’s Final Say on Brexit campaignAs a Momentum member, this is why I back a Final SayNational Union of Students backs The Independent’s Final Say campaign If the party “cannot get a general election”, the motion says it should “campaign for a public vote on the deal with an option to remain in the EU and following a defeat for the government,\u0026nbspcall for an immediate general election”.\u0026nbspThe launch of the campaign\u0026nbspcoincides with\u0026nbspa nationwide “Left Against Brexit” tour to encourage left-wing activists to speak out against Brexit.

But evidence suggests that\u0026nbspbiggest challenges lie aheadClick to followThe Independent OnlineEthiopia\u0027s prime minister Abiy Ahmed has been working to change to his country\u0027s political systemEthiopia’s new prime minister Abiy Ahmed has been embracing change, quite literally.\u0026nbspLast month, in what has become almost a trademark move, the beaming young leader of Africa’s second-largest nation hugged Isaias Afwerki, the autocratic president of erstwhile enemy Eritrea. Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphas been similarly intimate with Ethiopian opposition figures released from prison or invited home.Those gestures symbolise his inclusive approach since becoming the leader in April, on the back of three years of rolling unrest that looked destined to degenerate into intensifying conflict. Although a treacherous road lies ahead, the wildly popular Mr Ahmed has already transformed the political landscape, giving hope to millions of a more harmonious future.His election by the ruling coalition in late March, after the previous premier resigned, was seen as a victory for reformist elements, but few foresaw the radicalism of Mr Ahmed’s first months, as he used the prime ministerial bully pulpit to engineer rapid change. This involved normalising relations with Mr Afwerki after a cold war lasting 18 years,\u0026nbspand opening up domestic politics to banned groups. While Ethiopia has endured violent transitions in the past, this looks like a liberal democratic coup, and brings into question the future role of a formerly omnipotent ruling coalition.The four-party Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which 42-year-old Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleads, has ruled the Horn of Africa powerhouse as a multinational federation since 1991, after it and Eritrean rebels overthrew a military regime. Eritrea then seceded, but the countries began a vicious two-year war in 1998 after falling out over trading arrangements.Over the last decade, the EPRDF government was known for impressive infrastructure and anti-poverty programmes, but also for authoritarianism. It prioritised control, rather than pluralism, which meant a restrictive space for journalists, opposition groups\u0026nbspand civil society activists. The result was EPRDF monopolisation of all legislative seats in a country of 100 million people, an ineffectual\u0026nbspmedia,\u0026nbspand few civil society challengers to the government’s agenda.The Marxist-Leninist structured party drew its mandate from delivering growth, also arguing the system was democratic as it involved mass participation in development programmes, particularly in rural areas. Meanwhile, the federation granted autonomy and protected the linguistic and cultural identities of Ethiopia’s multifarious ethnic communities, theoretically enhancing its customised democracy.The destabilising protests by the Oromo, Ethiopia’s most populous ethnicity with around 35 million people, have battered that narrative. And now Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspappears intent on upending the EPRDF system from within, in pursuit of conventional democratisation.The demonstrations in Oromia, which surrounds the capital, Addis Ababa, were driven by the smothering of dissent, historic complaints of marginalisation\u0026nbspand more prosaic concerns over unjust evictions as the EPRDF’s growth model bulldozed Oromo farmers’ rights.World news in picturesUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

The earthquake, which struck western Japan, killed three people and injured more than 50Protests started in earnest a few months after a 2015 election when the sole opposition parliamentarian lost his seat. Although the Oromo are represented by Mr Ahmed’s party in the EPRDF, where decision-making is evenly split, opponents said the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) retained control. That party formed the EPRDF, spearheaded the rebellion that brought it to power, and its chairperson, Meles Zenawi, led Ethiopia from 1991 until his death in 2012. TPLF fighters established a new military and dominated the upper echelons of intelligence agencies.As protests spread in 2016, security forces tried to quell the unrest with lethal force, which only served to energise a youthful movement. Foreign-based activists such as Jawar Mohammed disseminated evidence of the latest outrage. When a botched security operation led to a deadly stampede at an Oromo cultural festival, Mr Mohammed\u0026nbspcatalysed “five days of rage”. Nationwide, over the three years, more than 1,000 protesters were killed, while farms, factories and government offices were destroyed.Under former prime\u0026nbspminister Hailemariam Desalegn, the EPRDF struggled to cope. That was partly a result of its travails after Mr Zenawi’s death. Some economic momentum remained, but dams and railways were delayed, and the government struggled to manage the stresses of growth. The coalition was increasingly fractious, and concerns over maladministration and corruption festered. Late last year, the EPRDF politburo bemoaned its own leadership failures after a marathon meeting and announced plans to reboot democratisation. That led to some initial prisoner releases.With the wind at their backs, the Oromo\u0026nbspprotests surged once more, cutting off Addis Ababa with a strike and road blockages. Mr Desalegn\u0026nbspresigned in February and a second state of\u0026nbspemergency was enacted to try to\u0026nbspregain control. It was then that Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspmoved.He had risen to lieutenant\u0026nbspcolonel in the military and served as deputy administrator of the Information Network Security Agency before becoming a parliamentarian and government minister. But his route to the top was as a leading light in a revitalised Oromo wing of the EPRDF, which\u0026nbspcapitalised on the protests to press the demands for greater power and autonomy. In March, his party elected him chairperson, partly because of his eligibility for prime\u0026nbspminister as a national MP –\u0026nbspand within weeks\u0026nbsphe was sworn-in at parliament.Ethiopian man finds his family in Eritrea after 18 yearsAddisalem Hadgu, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, reacts after meeting his wife, Nitslal Abraha, for the first time in eighteen years after Ethiopian Airlines ET314 flight arrived in Asmara, Eritrea Addisalem Hadgu embraces his daughters at Asmara International Airport Addisalem Hadgu gets ready in his hotel room after arriving in Asmara to meet his family for the first time in eighteen years in AsmaraAddisalem Hadgu with his wife, Nitslal and his daughtersAddisalem Hadgu sits on a couch, meeting his immediate family members for the first timeAddisalem Hadgu embraces his daughter Danayt AddisalemAddisalem Hadgu, 58, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, meets his brother-in-law, Solomon Yemane, 48, a member of the Eritrean military, in front of his hotelAddisalem Hadgu, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, reacts after meeting his wife, Nitslal Abraha, for the first time in eighteen years after Ethiopian Airlines ET314 flight arrived in Asmara, Eritrea Addisalem Hadgu embraces his daughters at Asmara International Airport Addisalem Hadgu gets ready in his hotel room after arriving in Asmara to meet his family for the first time in eighteen years in AsmaraAddisalem Hadgu with his wife, Nitslal and his daughtersAddisalem Hadgu sits on a couch, meeting his immediate family members for the first timeAddisalem Hadgu embraces his daughter Danayt AddisalemAddisalem Hadgu, 58, an Ethiopian state TV journalist, meets his brother-in-law, Solomon Yemane, 48, a member of the Eritrean military, in front of his hotelMr Ahmed\u0026nbspcomes from a mixed religious background and speaks three of Ethiopia’s main languages. That ersity is reflected in his governing outlook. Accelerating the EPRDF plan, he released all political prisoners and coaxed rebels from the bush, while activists such as Mr Mohammed\u0026nbsphave also triumphantly returned. Common themes of Mr Ahmed’s speeches have been love and integration, and the intention appears to be for a hotchpotch of political actors to participate peacefully in elections in 2020.\u0026nbspThat requires legislative changes to refine a catchall anti-terrorism law and encourage independent journalism and political activism. And in a delicate balancing act, it also means reestablishing government control of security after the unrest and seismic changes to the EPRDF system created something of a power vacuum.In the last few months, amid the euphoria, ethnic violence has endured or broken out in various locations\u0026nbspanti-government activity has continued in Oromia, a grenade was thrown at a massive Addis Ababa rally attended by Mr Ahmed, and there has been an uptick in vigilante killings –\u0026nbspand possibly two high-profile assassinations.Opinions vary starkly on the causes. After they lost control of the security apparatus, many blame TPLF-linked agitators, which has contributed to lethal attacks on Tigrayans, creating fear among that community. But it is evident that many disputes are driven by local dynamics, rather than purely resulting from external provocation.For example, the six million strong Sidama people are pressing a long held claim for their own region. In western Oromia, popular support for the Oromo Liberation Front bred fighting between regional forces and a holdout faction of the insurgency, while territorial clashes continued between the Oromo and neighbouring groups in the east and southeast. The federal government took a forceful step yesterday by sending in the military to assert control of Somali region and its unruly president.Assuming the security situation soon finally stabilises, non-violent politics will hopefully take centre stage. In recent years, much opposition activity has been focused on campaigning against the TPLF. But with its officials mostly now removed from top federal government positions, other fault lines will emerge. The overarching one is the federation comprising ethnic administrative units, which some opposition groups argue foments sectarianism. Defenders argue it can thrive in a democratised environment, but others counter that it has been the reach and grip of the EPRDF that has held the constitutional arrangement together thus far.\u0026nbspA further major challenge is economic. A vital aspect of the EPRDF operation was channelling financial resources into much-needed infrastructure to build the backbone of a modern market economy. That model is now in question with Abiy\u0026nbspAhmed’s government ramping up a privatisation programme as the state’s capacity for public investment dwindles. It is questionable that this more liberal approach can deliver the growth or the structural transformation that a still poor and agrarian economy desperately needs.Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwields great power, commands massive support\u0026nbspand has achieved a huge amount in a short space of time. But the evidence suggests that the biggest challenges to completing his transformative agenda lie ahead.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/12/axolotl-mexican-in-aquarium.jpg","title":"nuns salamanders mexico convent cough syrup achoques p tzcuaro","story":"Created with Sketch.Convent originally kept\u0026nbspamphibians to make ‘jarabe’ medicine from their skin, but are now helping boost\u0026nbspspecies\u0027 numbers after habitat started deterioratingClick to followThe Independent USAmbystoma dumerilii, known by locals as achoques, are found nowhere but Lake Pátzcuaro but their numbers are falling fast Atop the highest hill in this lakeside town sits the Basílica de Nuestra Señora de la Salud, built in the 1500s with whitewashed walls and red stone columns.On a street around the corner from the basilica, a wooden door framed in carved stone and marked with a cross fleury stands open from 9am\u0026nbspuntil 2pm, and again from 4pm\u0026nbspto 6pm.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We pray for you,” reads a sign on the door in Spanish.Inside, the room is sparse and dark save for a wooden window and three locked doors. Behind them is a convent, home to two dozen nuns of the Dominican Order.But the convent also hosts an even larger number of very unexpected residents: a thriving colony of endangered salamanders. Scientists call them Ambystoma dumerilii, but the nuns and everyone else in Pátzcuaro call them achoques.Carefully tended by the nuns, about 300 achoques live in glass aquaria and white enamel bathtubs lining the walls of a long hallway and two adjoining rooms in the convent. The nuns support themselves partly by selling a cough syrup called jarabe made from the salamanders’ skin.But the basilica’s achoques are increasingly valuable for another reason.They are found nowhere but Lake Pátzcuaro, and outside the convent their numbers are falling fast. There are smaller captive colonies elsewhere in Pátzcuaro, but none as large as the one in the basilica. It may be critical to the salamanders’ prospects in the wild.“That is why we consider that the nuns will be very vital in the future,” said Gerardo Garcia, a curator and expert on endangered species at the Chester Zoo in England.Janitzio Island, Lake Patzcuaro, Mexico (Michel SETBOUNGamma-Rapho via Getty Images)The salamanders are wondrous little monsters with granular skin the colour of Dijon mustard. They resemble miniature versions of the flying dragon-dog Falkor in “The Neverending Story.”As salamanders go, they’re huge — the largest ones approach a foot in length. But most striking are their gills: luxurious, ruddy filaments that frame their heads like manes and undulate gently in the water.In the basilica, their main caretaker is Sister Ofelia Morales Francisco. On a recent visit, she greeted a visitor in a white habit, her black veil crisp and pinned in place, a blue-beaded rosary dangling by her side.Asked a question, she sometimes answered only with a small smile. But around the achoques, she opens up, proud to show off her amphibious charges.cempasuchil flowers in a cemetery at the outskirt of Patzcuaro ( Miguel TovarLatinContentGetty Images)Their tanks are spotless, each with a bubbling aerator made from half of a plastic soda bottle filled with stones and coiled fabric. In a glass case above the tanks, a baby Jesus dressed as a doctor keeps watch.The sisters used to make their syrup using salamanders collected from the lake. When they began to disappear, the nuns established the convent’s colony because they were worried about losing the jarabe business.“What would we do — not make any syrup?” Sister Ofelia said in Spanish. But eventually she and the other nuns also came to recognise a conservation imperative in their work.“It’s about protecting a species from nature,” she said. “If we don’t work to take care of it, to protect it, it will disappear from creation.”Like axolotls, their flamboyant, better-known cousins, achoques live their entire lives underwater. As adults, they keep the external gills that most salamanders have only as aquatic larvae.As the number of people living around Lake Pátzcuaro, one of the largest in Mexico, has steadily increased over the centuries, the water quality has suffered. Runoff exacerbated by deforestation carries silt and pollution into the lake.World news in picturesUsable items are salvaged from a home destroyed in an earthquake in North Lombok, Indonesia.

The earthquake, which struck western Japan, killed three people and injured more than 50Untreated sewage is still dumped into water, and an invasive hyacinth spreads along its shores. Cow pastures extend right to the lake’s marshy edges.To make matters worse, largemouth bass intentionally were introduced into Lake Pátzcuaro in the 1930s, and in 1974 the much more destructive carp were brought in. They eat the eggs and larvae of the achoques.Between 1982 and 2010, the already shallow lake declined by about 13 feet, losing a quarter of its total volume because of declining rainfall and increasing runoff carried into the lake. Various efforts to rehabilitate Pátzcuaro have met only limited success.Achoques aren’t the only Mexican salamanders in trouble. Of the 17 species in their genus found in Mexico, 12 are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Worldwide, salamanders face numerous threats, from habitat loss to the illegal pet trade. A new fungus has been killing salamanders in Europe.At Lake Pátzcuaro, fishermen have been catching and eating achoques since before the Spanish arrived in Mexico. In the late 1970s and early 80s, achoques caught in the lake were piled high at the fish market in town, recalled Brad Shaffer, a professor of biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the salamanders.But the numbers of achoques started to fluctuate wildly in the ‘80s and crashed in 1989. In 1985, a friar suggested that the nuns start their own colony because the lake was deteriorating, according to Sister Ofelia.It wasn’t until 2000 that the nuns had their own thriving community of salamanders in the convent. The nuns have been cooking up jarabe, however, for nearly a century.“People have faith in it because the nuns make it,” said Dolores Huacuz, an expert on the region’s amphibians and a retired university professor.Local legend has it that the sisters got the secret recipe from a young Purépecha woman, one of the indigenous people who lived in this region before Spanish colonisation.Her jarabe cured one of the sisters, strengthening her lungs and abolishing her anemia. And the identity of that young woman, according to the story: the Virgin Mary herself, in disguise.Whether or not the cough syrup recipe came to the nuns through ine intervention, there’s no doubt that the Purépecha people were eating achoques and using them for medicine long before the arrival of Europeans and Catholicism, according to Tzintia Velarde Mendoza, a project coordinator at Faunam, a wildlife conservation group, who has studied the cultural history of the achoques.Garcia, of the Chester Zoo, has been working with a team based in Mexico to survey Lake Pátzcuaro to try to figure out how many salamanders are left in the wild, and where in the lake they live.“Jumping into reintroduction programmes looks very sexy in the media for one news release, but that’s really not the best way to do it,” Garcia said.There are still wild achoques left in the lake, Garcia said, including a small population in the northern part of the lake. Fishermen have told Garcia’s team that they do occasionally spot the salamanders.But as the population has thinned, so has its genetic ersity. That’s where the convent’s thriving colony may one day make an enormous difference — assuming it is genetically erse itself.Nearly every species of lemur at risk of extinctionBeavers returned to Forest of Dean after 400 years Venomous new snake species discovered and immediately declared at riskIvory sold illegally across Europe, driving elephants to extinction“Three hundred iniduals, if they’re relatively unrelated, is a very, very healthy, large stock to be working from,” Shaffer said.At the moment, however, there are no plans to move achoques from the convent to the lake. Before that happens, the water quality issues must be addressed, Garcia said, and the genetic ersity of the nuns’ colony must be assessed. Work on both issues is ongoing, he said.In the room where the nuns sell their cough syrup, a mural on the wall depicts the lake with salamanders swimming in clear waters. The glowing hands of a nun hold an achoque beside an image of the Virgin Mary.“Being part of a religious order like ours is not an obstacle for scientific progress,” Sister Ofelia said.“The order is devoted to the research of theological and scientific knowledge in benefit of humanity,” she added. Part of the order’s mission is “to work in favour of a more humane conscience full of love and justice for nature.”Another mural bears the official name of the nuns’ Management Unit for the Conservation of Wildlife, registered with the Mexican government: Jimbani Erandi. In the language of the indigenous Purépecha people, it means “new dawn.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/05/17/steven-seagal-putin.jpg","title":"steven seagal us russia envoy hollywood putin humanitarian","story":"Created with Sketch.Hollywood actor who once\u0026nbspdescribed Vladimir Putin as\u0026nbsp\u0027one of the greatest world leaders’,\u0026nbspwas granted Russian citizenship in 2016Click to followThe Independent OnlinePresident Putin shakes hands with Steven Seagal during a meeting at the Kremlin in November 2016Russia has appointed martial artist and action film star Steven Seagal\u0026nbspas a special envoy to improve ties with the United States.\u0026nbspIn a Facebook post, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that the Under Siege as been appointed to a new role, which allegedly will\u0026nbspbe unpaid.His responsibility will be to “facilitate relations between Russia and the United States in the humanitarian field, including cooperation in culture, arts, public and youth exchanges.”In 2015,\u0026nbspBuzzFeed\u0026nbspNews reported that two years earlier, Vladimir Putin had suggested to then President Barack Obama that he could make Mr Seagal\u0026nbspthe honorary Russian consul to California and Arizona.\u0026nbsp​Then in November 2016, Mr Seagal visited the Russian president at the Kremlin and was granted Russian citizenship.\u0026nbspSeagal\u0027s grandmother was born in Vlaostok\u0026nbspand the actor and Mr Putin share a passion for martial arts.In a 2013 interview with news channel RT, Seagal\u0026nbspsaid he believed Mr Putin was\u0026nbspone of the greatest world leaders, if not the greatest world leader, alive today.”\u0026nbspSteven Seagal accused of rape by extra from 1994 filmSteven Seagal calls female reporters \u0027a bunch of f***ing dirty whores\u0027Steven Seagal comments on NFL protests, debuts bizarre new lookBut Seagal has faced some criticism for some comments he has made about the controversial Russian leader.After he\u0026nbsppraised Putin\u0027s annexation of Crimea,\u0026nbspKiev banned\u0026nbspSeagal\u0026nbspfrom entering Ukraine for five years, claiming he had\u0026nbsp“committed socially dangerous actions” that could threaten their security.\u0026nbspSeagal was also granted Serbian citizenship in 2016, after he offered\u0026nbspto open a martial arts academy in Belgrade.The action film star has also met with Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/999030_1.jpg","title":"brexit news ed balls referendum second vote","story":"                Top Labour politician ATTACKS calls for second EU referendum                 Ex-Tory MP BLASTS EU as he claims Britons would vote Leave againREMAIN CRITIC.......

Each of you have something unique about you which we want\u0026rsquo.Noah claims that being a history buff, he was told that would be his specialist subject when in the future, while five other people in his group were given other topics such as architecture and space.He said a microchip was implanted under his skin by a doctor before the mission began.He said: \u0026ldquoThey basically put it in my left wrist and I remember the doctor laying me down and saying this is going to hurt for a whole week.\u0026ldquoHe said just be brave about it.Noah said after being \u0026ldquozapped he woke in a room that had bunk beds and a wardrobe filled with basic clothes.He said despite time travelling several different times, one of the only locations he remembered is going to South America on a mission to target Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar before he died.Though Noah did not reveal any further details of the mission.Noah said in his group of five was \u0026ldquoone female which he found surprising because he had been under the impression the US government only wanted \u0026ldquostraight, white guys to time travel.The \u0026lsquotime traveller\u0026rsquo also said when he got back to the current year, he felt \u0026ldquodrained by the mission and \u0026ldquoslept a lot.In the Charlie Chaplin film The Circus a woman is seen supposedly talking on a phone (Image: )Noah claims he signed a contract with the government to travel through time for a total of eight years and that others had signed up for 50 years.Noah\u0026rsquos video has had a whopping 9,021 views to date after being uploaded by ApexTV.Comments on the footage praise Noah for coming forward with his extraordinary tale.One commenter, who posted their opinion with the sunglasses emoji, said: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely cool!

Available only to the elite few who could afford them at first, they were designed purely to enable people to take a call while away from home.Fast forward a couple of decades and we are all glued to our devices, a nation of addicts.We are now so wedded to our smartphones that we check them every 12 minutes.The average Brit spends more than a day a week online, twice as long as ten years ago.This surge in time online is largely down to the rise of smartphones, which are now used by 78 per cent of the population compared with just 17 per cent in 2008.My personal bugbear is people who walk along the street in a slow zig-zag because they are glued to their phone.And there’s nothing worse than someone who interrupts a conversation to take a call or read a text.It surely can’t be a coincidence that, in the same week as this report was released, we hear about five-year-olds starting school unable to speak in sentences — partly, no doubt, down to parents plugging them into a screen rather than talking or reading to them.I’ve got a Blackberry, mainly because I like the keyboard. But I am probably as hooked on it as the next person.It’s an invaluable tool for anyone wanting to work flexibly. But I also do a fair amount of pointless surfing on it.I’m not into all forms of social media, but I am a bit of a news junkie and I’ll confess I also watch the odd funny YouTube film with my kids.Unfortunately, progress in technology has brought the idea that we “should” all be available 24/7.In fact, people are quite indignant if you don’t reply to an email within the hour — even if it’s sent at 4am.Being a conscientious type, the result for me if I’m not careful, is that if I wake up in the night I’ll check my emails and maybe even reply to a few before going back to sleep. Now that can’t be good for the old circadian rhythms.The other problem with everyone being always available and always “on” is that our FOMO — fear of missing out — has increased exponentially.We’re all terrified that if we’re offline for too long we won’t get to . . . what exactly? See photos of someone’s hashtag perfect holibobs with the famalam — and then feel like our life is rubbish by comparison?I use Twitter a bit but I avoid Facebook and Instagram, partly because I don’t want the possibility that the opinions and “likes” of people I don’t know may influence me more than my own values and views.And another problem with the prevalence of tech is that we don’t have any down time.All those previously blank moments — on the bus, waiting for our microwave meal to cook, lying in bed at night — have all become an opportunity to surf, tweet, and message. We are going to burn out if we aren’t careful.I always know when I’m really relaxed because I accidentally go out without my phone.Granted, it generally only happens when I’m on holiday.But now I know how close we are to becoming actual addicts, I feel like we should all build in some time away from our devices.After all, the more time we spend looking at a screen, the less time we spend looking at the world and engaging with other people.So maybe we should all take a moment to leave our phone at home, go for a walk, and switch from “on” to “off”.Isn’t that a liberating thought?I’M sure a fair few people felt a bit guilty reading about the Vogue interview with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie this week.The sisters talk about how hard it is living in the public eye but also the criticism and mockery they face, often attacked for taking too many holidays.Who knows, perhaps some of that criticism is justified.But a lot of the comments they get are about their appearance and clothes – and that is where it crosses a line.No-one chooses the family into which they are born, and they are trying to make the best of the hand they’ve been given.They are trying to build careers and have a personal life while being in the public eye and that can’t be easy.I hope people realise that and give them a break.HAVING spent the past couple of decades getting annoyed at anyone who utters the words “Poor Jennifer Aniston”, this week, for the first time ever, I said them myself.You know why?Because the 49-year-old has been forced to publicly address, again, the tedious topic of why she hasn’t had a baby.She also alluded to something no woman should have to share with anyone they don’t want to, let alone the world – the fact she might be medically unable to procreate.Poor Jen. She can’t just get on with her very successful – and no doubt happy – life without being plagued by speculation.In the same interview she took the chance to spell it out: Just because she split from Justin Theroux doesn’t mean her life is over.She might even be happy to have finally got shot of him.“The misconceptions are ‘Jen can’t keep a man’,” she said. “And ‘Jen refuses to have a baby because she’s selfish and committed to her career.’ Or that I’m sad and heartbroken . . . first, with all due respect, I’m not heartbroken. And second, those are reckless assumptions.“No one knows what’s going on behind closed doors. No one considers how sensitive that might be for my partner and me. They don’t know what I’ve been through medically or emotionally.“There is a pressure on women to be mothers, and if they are not, then they’re deemed damaged goods. Maybe my purpose on this planet isn’t to procreate. Maybe I have other things I’m supposed to do.”So yes. Poor, poor Jen being under the world’s watchful and pitying eye all the time.Just to remind people. Jennifer Aniston is one of the world’s most successful stars.She has a big group of friends and a beautiful home, which she bought herself. She has dogs she adores, she’s funny, busy, and fulfilled.But all of that is worth nothing, of course. She doesn’t have kids.To anyone reading this who thinks women must have children to be fulfilled, please take note: Plenty of women don’t want to get married or have kids.Many other women want kids but can’t have them.And guess what? It’s none of our business.Here’s another way of looking at Jennifer’s life. She is lucky.She gets to please herself and hasn’t had to make any of the sacrifices that many of us make to become mothers.Also, George Clooney didn’t meet Amal until he was 51. Hugh Grant got married this year at 57 (after many failed relationships). Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, and Jude Law, 45, are still single and dating. Has anyone ever said: “Poor George/Hugh/Leonardo/Jude”?Of course they haven’t. So let’s stop saying it about Jennifer, too.I SO related to Carol Vorderman’s delight at being asked for proof of age when she bought some wine at M\u0026ampS recently.When you’re young, being asked to prove your age, as the presenter, above, was is very annoying. But as time goes by it’s one of life’s little victories.Having said that, this hasn’t happened to me in Aldi. Maybe I ought to go to M\u0026ampS!I’M truly appalled by the news that the Home Office “turns a blind eye” to the plight of British teenagers who are being forced to marry abroad, then raped and impregnated – after which the ministerial department actually hands a visa to their husbands.These young British women in question are forced abroad, or told they are going on holiday, but in reality are forced into a marriage and to get pregnant so that they can apply for a UK visa for their “husband”.Officials received dozens of reports last year that women wanted to block visas for men they had been made to marry in countries including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and the United Arab Emirates.But in almost half of their cases the visas were approved nonetheless! And experts believe that there are thousands more victims who are too afraid to come forward.The women forced into this situation must be absolutely terrified, not least because their own family is complicit in this abuse.The authorities when granting the visa do not actually speak to the “wife”. There is no whistle-blowing process or opportunity for the women to make a confidential statement. Any statement made is public.Authorities fear that if they block the visa they will be called racists, but this is a safeguarding issue and that fear of causing offence really has to stop.We need to get on top of the problem by working with schools to raise awareness, so girls know how to report it.And we need to work with social workers so they can recognise the family members are the perpetrators of this crime.GOSH, how shocking is the video footage of a woman called Arabella Juniper Torres calling the police to report a woman, who happened to be black, for sheltering in her doorway in Brooklyn, New York, while waiting for her Uber?We are living in the age of the death of the Good Samaritan.I helped someone carry a pushchair downstairs at the Tube last week – as all the burly men walked past, I might add.She was so grateful it made me realise small acts of kindness have all but disappeared.

And how did they get so sick that they believe their behaviour is socially acceptable?These women-hating bullies — Liam Holmes, 20, who battered a woman to the ground outside Faces nightclub, and the five smirking thugs who tormented a vulnerable woman but can’t be named because they are under 18 — are not the products of brutal, inner-city gangland.These blights on the face of British manhood are the product of ordinary homes, God help us.They are what our young men look like now.They are not feral kids who never had a chance.They are not the products of deprived lives.The leering bullies posing proudly around their terrified victim in that sun-drenched park are growing up in Bury St Edmunds, a peaceful Suffolk market town with pretty cottages and a lovely cathedral, while Liam Holmes attacked his victim outside a club that was once a fashionable oasis for footballers and pop stars, the Essex answer to New York’s Studio 54.These thugs all have dear old mums who love them to bits.Indeed, the mother of one of the park scum sacks — a woman who must have an IQ lower than her dress size — complained that her son was the one suffering now because the backlash has ruined his 16th birthday.The poor little lamb! What’s the world coming to if you and your mates can’t torture a vulnerable middle-aged woman in the park any more?Personally, I hope the backlash ruins his life.And while we ponder these pitiful excuses for young men, let us spare a thought for their female victims.The 18-year-old woman who was punched to the ground by Liam Holmes has been predictably abused in the sewer of social media, informed “she deserved it” for daring to speak back to a man, and gloatingly told that, “she had a lesson in true equality.Meanwhile the vulnerable 49-year-old woman who was brutalised in the park has spoken with incredible restraint about her experience, which must have been as humiliating as it was frightening.“Considering the respective ages of all parties and that it was five or six young men versus me alone, I remain surprised that they behaved in such a way towards me,” she said.“I would like to hear their reasons, if possible.”Which is so mild-mannered that I find it breaks my bloody heart.It is tempting to blame the surge in violence against women on social media, and brainless morons like the little d**ks in that park taking pictures to show off to their mates. But it can’t all be blamed on social media.I bet Liam Holmes wishes there were no cameras around when he was smashing a woman in the jaw.“He wouldn’t do that for no reason,” protests his mother Cathy, 53. “There was a lot that went on before that people don’t know about.”Sorry, there can never be an excuse, reason or justification for a man or boy to abuse a woman or girl. Not ever.The old taboo about men being violent towards women should still stand.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they say something cutting to you at chucking out time.Lads, it doesn’t matter if they have the insolent cheek to sit on the park bench where you like to hang out with your bad-ass homies in the Bury St Edmunds massive.How hard is it to understand?Men should not be violent towards women.My father, the hardest man I ever met, taught me a real man does not raise his voice to a woman, let alone his hand.But that generation of tough, gentle men has gone and in their place we have pitiful excuses for the male of the species who feel empowered by belittling, beating and abusing women.And what sickens the stomach about the boys in the park is that they all look so very pleased with themselves, as if tormenting a vulnerable woman who, in the words of her stepmother “wouldn’t say boo to a goose” is the high point of their miserable lives.It is a good job their mothers all love them because I can’t imagine any other self-respecting woman ever will.“He’s never had a girlfriend,” someone remarked of woman-bashing lout, Liam Holmes.Yes, it shows. The big close-up Nicole posted on Instagram is absolutely terrifying. What a scary face! The spider, I mean. Not Nicole.HOW sweet life was for Jeremy Corbyn when he was a loopy left-wing backbencher, free to flutter his eyelashes at the IRA, to stand on platforms that compared Israel to Nazi Germany and to bowl up on Iranian TV praising the release of Hamas terrorists who had murdered Jewish children.But now fate has Corbyn as a possible Prime Minister his support of extremism is not such a good look.And no matter how pathetic this Tory Government becomes, no matter how timid, weak and gutless Theresa May looks in the face of Brussels’ bullying, the British people will never choose for Prime Minister a man who considers the child killers in Hamas to be his “brothers”.“In the past, in the pursuit of peace and justice for the Palestinian people, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject,” apologises panicky Corbyn, a man who can feel the keys to 10 Downing Street slipping through his fingers.The past is coming back to haunt Jeremy Corbyn.And it will destroy him.It might also have something to do with the celeb fear of looking like a sweaty idiot with two left feet, while wearing nipple-crushing Lycra on prime-time television.Luckily, Nadiya Bychkova, above, will be there for her second series, the only pro dancer who looks more like a celebrity than any of the celebrities.THOSE who want the UK to remain in the European Union have never made any attempt to persuade the 17.4million who voted to leave to change our minds.They just insult us.Peter Mandelson says Brexiteers “hate other countries and hate foreigners” while Stewart Lee, a pot-bellied Bernard Manning for snowflakes, says: “It wasn’t just racists that voted to leave Europe – c**** did as well. Stupid f****** c****.”Just insults.Which is why Remain lost the referendum. And why they would lose 100 referendums.BAKE Off winner Nadiya Hussain tells Loose Women: “I work in an industry that is heavily dominated by male, middle-class, middle-aged men and there’s no space for a 5ft brown girl, who wears a headscarf.”But you became a national treasure, Nadiya.So self-pity is misplaced.MADONNA turns 60 years old on August 16 and has marked the birthday by laying provocatively on the ground sporting suspenders, lacy bra and a been-to-bed expression in her half-closed eyes.The Material Girl still looks great, of course.Mind you, she does look as though she might need a hand getting back on her feet. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fine. But this leopard is not about to change his spots.Throughout his life he has shown terrible judgment.

We ran to the beach to be clear of buildings which we could hear falling all around.What we know so far...Local authorities said those stranded on the Gilis - the three tropical islands popular with backpackers and divers - were being evacuated today.But footage posted online showed panicked tourists and locals packed onto powder-white beaches before climbing over each other to board tiny boats leaving the island.Meanwhile frightened residents across all affected islands, particularly north Lombok, poured out of their homes and moved to higher ground after the quake triggered a Tsunami warning.Kelsall added: It was literally the most terrifying thing I have experienced and the uncertainty of the tsunami - I had pictures of Thailand in my head from when it happened there.Pop superstar Gary Barlow was one of the unfortunate tourists whose holidays were cut abruptly short by the devastating earthquake.He shared footage of himself doing yoga in an iddylic island location in the days before the quake hit and killed more than 100 people.As and many other foreign tourists fled the country, he wrote on Twitter: I bumped into so many British families leaving Bali. How lucky we are to have that choice.I’ve had the misfortune of being in 7 earthquakes but none have felt more deep and raw as last nights.Followed by numerous after shocks. Praying for everyone affected.Michelle Thompson, an American who was holidaying on one of the Gilis with her husband, described a violent scramble to get on boats leaving for the main island.She said: People were just throwing their suitcases on board and I had to struggle to get my husband on because he was bleeding.Muhammad Faozal, head of West Nusa Tenggaras tourism agency, said: We cannot evacuate all of them all at once because we dont have enough capacity on the boats.Its understandable they want to leave the Gilis, they are panicking.Some areas still hadnt been reached because rescuers have been slowed down by collapsed bridges, electricity blackouts and damaged roads.On Lombok, soldiers and other rescuers carried injured people on stretchers and carpets to evacuation centres, with many having to be treated outdoors because hospitals were too damaged.More terrifying footage showed screaming people running from their homes in Bali as cars and bikes rocked shook on the roads.Terrified tourists, including Barlow and supermodel Chrissy Teigen, took to Twitter to reveal their horror as tremors ripped through the island.Authorities issued a tsunami warning in the aftermath which covers North Lombok, East and North Bali, the north side of east Java, south-east Madura, south Kalimantan, and south Sulawesi.Barlow had been unwinding in a peaceful retreat by meditating, pictures of which he had shared with fans on Instagram who then became worried when news broke of the quake.After his ordeal, he tweeted: Thank you for your concern - we’re all fine - a bit shaken up.The quake was felt for several seconds in Bali, where people ran out of houses, hotels and restaurants.All the hotel guests were running so I did too. People filled the streets, said Michelle Lindsay, an Australian tourist.A lot of officials were urging people not to panic.Model Chrissy Teigen, who is in Bali, was live tweeting in the aftermath of quake, reporting: Bali. Trembling. So long.Moments earlier she had written: MASSIVE earthquake.Dazed and confused, she then walked out of her home clutching her baby while undressed.Other witnesses said the quake got stronger over several seconds and rattled windows and doors in their frames.Brit holidaymaker Reuben Messam, from Bedfordshire, told Sun Online he was in a small village of Bedugul in Bali.He said:  We were eating dinner when the quake occurred then suddenly the floor started to shake,  people started to panic. I saw people running towards the door.But then someone started to shout get under the table and then glasses of beer were falling off.The waiters and the waitresses said they were scared as it is very rare to have one this big..Tourist Hannah Small told : We are saying in Ubud, our whole hotel was shaking and parts of the ceiling and walls were falling down.It was awful, we rushed from the third floor to reach safety!Like Bali, Lombok is known for pristine beaches and mountains.Hotels and other buildings in both locations are not allowed to exceed the height of coconut trees.Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries."},{"url":null,"title":"travellers rhyl wales asda car park","story":"Staff at the store in Rhyl, North Wales, reportedly stood in front of a convoy of caravans in a bid to stop them setting up temporary home on the premises.Witnesses said voices were raised during the dramatic confrontation before local police arrived at the scene.The caravans entered the car park in Kimnel Bay yesterday at around 5.30pm.Onlookers allege that the travellers broke down a barrier to gain entry to the area, reports the Daily Post.Cops were quickly called but were unable to stop the caravan owners from setting up camp.One woman, who does not want to be named, told the Post:  “Some of the travellers had already arrived so ASDA put the barriers down to stop more entering the car park.”She said the large group of travellers argued with around six police officers and that there was a lot of “finger pointing” and shouting.The witness added: “It was utter chaos so we decided not to get out (of our car) and drove away.”Another local said she had seen a group of travellers unsuccessfully attempting to gain access to the same Asda earlier in the week.Cops left the scene shortly after speaking to the caravan owners."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000398694676.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain refusing visas for russian diplomats","story":"The Kremlin’s ambassador to the UK has complained that his embassy is being “suffocated” as he can’t bring in new staff to replace departing ones.The move is being seen as continued retaliation for the novichok assassination attempt on ex-MI6 agent Sergei Skripal, which killed Dawn Sturgess by mistake last month.A total of 23 Russian spies were expelled from Britain after the initial nerve agent attack in March when Theresa May blamed Moscow for it.Russia’s Ambassador to London Alexander Yakovenko complained: “They cannot work here forever, but those people cannot be replaced.“For example, an employee, who was heading the press office, has left without any replacement.“It is an intentional policy carried out by the current British government”.British visas for his staff now take as long as 18 months to issue, Mr Yakovenko complained in an interview with Moscow’s Rossiya-24 TV channel.He added: “The mission is being suffocated because people are being expelled while some just end their tenure in a natural way”.The Foreign Office did not last night deny the Russian ambassador’s accusations.An FCO spokeswoman would only say: “We hold regular dialogue at official level with Russia on the visa exchange process”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Believing it was just a bit of harmless fun, Toni agreed.But she was unaware they dye was black henna - a chemical that can cause dangerous burns and in some cases permanent scarring.Her two sons suffered a severe reaction and which caused the designs to melt into their skin.Posting on Facebook to warn other parents, Toni said: “This is what black henna can do to your skin! We let our children have them on holiday not thinking for a second it would be dangerous.“The hospital have said that the chemicals/dyes in black henna are too strong.They now have chemical burns and are on antibiotics and antihistamines in the hope that they don’t get infection or get poorly. If you are offered it say NO!”Toni, of Colne, Lancs, added: “I’m gutted! Wouldn’t have gone near it if I’d have known. I just presumed it was harmless. Feel so bad, didn’t even know black henna was dangerous.There were loads of people offering it too. It makes me so mad how many people are doing it over there. The docs have said not to put anything on them, once it’s started to heal I’ll try something, maybe bio oil.”The post has been shared hundreds of times, with Carrice Dickinson commenting: “Oh my god that’s horrendous! Hope they make a speedy recovery poor boys.”Helen Feeney added: “That looks painful. It has the same chemicals in as hair dye only in much higher strengths. Lethal stuff so i hope they will be OK.”They are readily available abroad and are sometimes offered in the UK at festivals and fairs.However, the NHS warns these tattoos can contain high levels of toxic chemical dye, which it is normally illegal to use on the skin.The paste contains an ingredient called paraphenylenediamine (PPD). In the EU, this chemcial can legally be used in hair dyes - but not for tattoos.Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explained: When applied to the skin in the form of a black henna temporary tattoo, PPD can cause chemical burns and lead to allergic reactions.In extreme cases, black henna tattoos can lead to swelling, blistering and permanent scarring of the skin.Black henna tattoos can also increase sensitivity to PPD, meaning you could have a serious allergic reaction to legal hair dyes.The family had been staying at the three-star all-inclusive Caribbean Village Agador in Morocco last month. It’s believed the henna tattoos were done nearby.The NHS warns against having them done while abroad, with their website saying: “If you see a shop or stall offering to paint black tattoos onto your skin, don’t be tempted to get one.It could leave you scarred for life and put you at risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction.“Often called “black henna” or “neutral henna” tattoos, these patterns painted onto your skin are readily available abroad.But the black paste used in these temporary tattoos may contain high levels of a chemical dye so powerful and toxic that it is illegal to use it on the skin in this way.”The risks of bla ck henna lie in the paste’s ingredients – specifically a chemical called PPD.Dr Chris Flower, director general of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explains: “PPD is safely and legally used in permanent hair dyes where clear instructions are given, and where the maximum level is controlled by law.But black henna often contains PPD at high levels, to give a dark colour quickly.“When applied to the skin in the form of a black henna temporary tattoo, PPD can cause chemical burns and lead to allergic reactions.”Last month, mum Jade Morris, 26, of Oldbury, West Mids, revealed how her two children were scarred for life after getting henna tattoos done in Tunisia. She’d also been unaware that the dye used on her eight-year-old son River-Jae and daughter Farah, five, was black henna.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite widespread public revulsion with the habit elsewhere in the world, neither killing dogs to eat nor consuming their meat is illegal in Britain.A total ban on the import, trade and consumption of dog meat is about to be enacted across America by the US Congress next month after similar concerns about its increase there.The government is being urged to repeat the US ban here, and the move last night won the backing of a series of senior MPs. The World Dog Alliance will launch a nationwide campaign in the UK for a full ban on any interaction with dog meat in the Autumn.The WDA’s Kike Yuen told The Sun last night: “In the US, people who eat dog meat are mainly immigrants from Asia. With three million immigrants from East Asia in the UK, we cannot deny this situation exists here too”.Mr Yeun added: “We also believe legislation against dog meat in UK would provide us with strength to continue our work in Asia, as the UK could influence other countries to stop dog meat consumption. Most of them usually refused to do so with the excuse that there is no such law in Western countries”.It is still legal to kill dogs and eat them in the UK, as long as they are killed in a way that does not cause suffering. Though the practice has been taboo across much of Europe for a century, there is also no specific ban on buying or selling dog meat either.Dog lover and Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan last night dubbed a full ban “absolutely right”. Sir Alan, who owns a prize-winning cockapoo called Noodle, said: “There is no need in the modern world for this disgusting habit. We should nip it in the bud now to make sure the practice never takes off here. A civilised country is decent to animals, so let’s be fully decent here.”The chair of the All-party Parliamentary Dog Advisory Welfare Group Lisa Cameron MP added: “I very much support a ban on dog meat consumption in the UK, and urge the Government to look at this as a matter of urgency. We must be culturally sensitive, but I do not believe the general public would approve of the practice at all.”The SNP MP added: “Dogs are sentient beings and we value them very highly as pets. The last thing we want is dog farms here”.An estimated 30 million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.In China, 20 per cent of the population still eat dog meat - some because of the superstitious belief that it is a health tonic - and the country accounts for half the annual slaughter.In South Korea, 60 per cent of people eat dog meat regularly, and 5 million dogs are slaughtered each year to feed their appetite. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last night refused to comment.BRITAIN is a nation of dog-lovers.Our four-legged friends heroically work alongside our police, fire services and armed forces.They assist the disabled. And they provide unconditional love for millions.Now, leading dog charities have warned that the consumption of dog meat here is on the rise.This sick trend cannot continue.Campaigners are calling on the Government to outlaw it.But it is horrifying that this is not already the case.America will enact legislation next month to make it illegal there.Our Government must do the same.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also emerged that boys and girls are especially influenced by their relationship with the opposite sex parent.Sir Paul Coleridge, chairman of Marriage Foundation, said: “Mummy’s boys and daddy’s girls have been known about for generations as something of a stereotypical joke. But girls and boys, as they develop, do indeed have differing emotional needs and expectations and do best when these needs are satisfied.“A strong relationship with the parent of the opposite sex boosts self-esteem and peer group relationship skills both of which support sound mental health.Overall, teenagers are much more likely to be close to their mother than their father.A total of 81% of girls were found to be ‘very’ or ‘extremely close’ to their others, while only 59% were the same with their fathers.

Only whites qualify.For decades, the likes of Harriet Harman have led the crusade for equality, attacking men as oppressors and demanding — rightly — that women must be protected from abuse.Harman famously refuses even to endorse marriage as the best foundation for raising a family, let alone as a good thing in itself, a public commitment.Yet she and the overwhelming majority of virtue- signalling Labour MPs are silent, for instance, on the treatment of some Muslim women by some Muslim men.I can’t recall a Labour street protest against forced ­marriage or honour killings even though they are commonplace here and reprehensible in any society. Even the Home Office feels cowed when dealing with victims.Indeed, Labour turned on its own brave MP Sarah Champion for daring to raise the issue of rampant sex-trafficking by “mainly Pakistani men”.On the Left, racism trumps rape. Now, like the “F-word”, it has become the reach-for term of abuse applied to any debate — including the issue of Britain leaving the European Union.Opposition to the EU’s ­corrupt and undemocratic “Grand Projet” long precedes the uncontrolled mass immigration unleashed by Labour.Illegal immigration is simply another symptom of EU “we know best” arrogance — personified by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Yet preposterous Tory MP Anna “Suck-It-Up” Soubry routinely slurs 17.4million referendum voters as “racist”.It is the mantra of all those who see Brexit voters — more than half the country — as thick and nasty.Odious Peter Mandelson joined in last week, avoiding the “R-word” but ludicrously accusing anyone who wants to leave the EU of “hating foreigners”, which is the same thing.“Nationalism is a hatred of foreigners,” says the slippery Euro peer. “They should not be confused with patriots.”“I voted Remain in the referendum though I entirely respect the contrary view of many others.”Mandy’s relationship with the truth has always been flaky, but this is pure cant.Even those who once worked alongside Lord Mandelson when Labour still stood for something are appalled.Ex-Home Secretary and fellow Remainer David Blunkett snapped yesterday: “The allegation that some of those voting for Leave were ‘racist’ is not a new one.“It has been bandied about and seems to me not only an insult to the many people that I used to represent who voted Leave, but also to utterly miss the point of why the majority of British people voted the way they did.“If we fail to understand, then we do ourselves, but crucially also our democracy, a great disservice.”Lord Blunkett also slammed Mandy’s call for a second referendum.He is right. It is now clear the mood has hardened against bullying Brussels.The EU’s own snide insinuations that voters here are racist “Little Englanders” has not helped.Bank of England boss Mark Carney, architect of Project Fear, sank the Pound last week by claiming chances of a clean-break Brexit were “uncomfortably high”.Trade Secretary Liam Fox warns the odds are now 60-40 against a deal.Remainers should understand that every gratuitous insult to the intelligence of decent British voters is another nail in Theresa May’s chances of a friendly ­negotiated settlement.McDonnell, cleverer than Corbyn, wants to stop Labour being dragged into what deputy leader Tom Watson calls a “vortex of eternal shame”. But McDonnell, too, is stained by anti-Jewish sentiment.In any case, Britain needs Jeremy Corbyn – to remain in place as the sullen figurehead of a blinkered Marxist rabble and remind voters what they are risking at the next election.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Waste of my time!Discussing why he made the video, Paul said: I filmed it because I often tell mates about people not turning up and they think Im joking, they dont believe me.I personally think its getting worse. I think there is a culture of people not wanting to confront people or just be honest about things.We hire every three-six months or so when we need to re-recruit but every time we do it I would say it is getting worse and worse.I set aside the whole day and had seven interviews lined up. For each interview I printed off their CV, familiarised myself with it, prepped my questions for them.I like to be prepared because I think you should look organised and professional as their potential future employer.For each person youre looking at least 15 minutes prep time for each person. Theres quite a bit to it - you dont just say alright Dave, come on in.Just three out of seven turned up. I couldnt believe it.Youre raging about it anyway but then youre wondering whether to crack on with your work in the spare time.You dont know if theyre going to suddenly turn up.Obviously my job is not just to employ people all day. I have lots of paperwork, invoicing and even making and delivering pies.It left me not knowing whether to start all my other work or not. Id plotted the whole day out carefully so it messes it all up.But not only that, its more the fact that its wasted your time. Youve lost a lot of time.I cant put a price on how much my time is at work per hour but if you were to shell out £15 an hour for someone just to sit there you would be pretty p***ed off.I didnt hear from any of them who didnt turn up apart from one who claimed his daughter was in hospital and his phone wouldnt work - every excuse under the sun. I think his budgie had died too.Despite the stress of hiring, Bowens Pies have gone from strength to strength and have gone from selling around 4,000 pies a week a decade ago to 20,000 a week today."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000424992696.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=720\" height=\"960","title":"cops discover starving children compound amalia new mexico","story":"The children, ages one to 15, were discovered in the Third World compound, which was built out of rubbish, in the desert near Amalia, New Mexico, after receiving a desperate a plea for help.The message, believed to have originated inside the compound, said: “We are starving and need food and water.”Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe described the compound as “the saddest living conditions and poverty” he has seen in 30 years on the job.Adults and children were barefoot and wore “dirty rags” as clothing and had probably been living there for several months.“I’ve been working this job for 30 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Sheriff Hogrefe told the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper.“People live off the grid, but man, not like this.” The only food found were a few potatoes and a box of rice.High-powered weapons also were discovered at the site, the paper said.“I absolutely knew that we couldn’t wait on another agency to step up and we had to go check this out as soon as possible,” Hogrefe said.At the time, cops were searching for three-year-old boy Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, who went missing from Clayton County, Ga., in December and was believed to be in the area.The authorities had their eye on the compound for two months, but they could not find probable cause to storm the place until they received the message that people were malnourished.They did not find the child at the site.Police arrested two men, Siraj Wahhaj and Lucas Morten, after discovering the compound. Three women who are believed to be the children’s mothers were detained and released.Wahhaj was collared on an outstanding arrest warrant from Georgia alleging child abduction. He was found inside the compound with an AR-15 rifle, five 30-round magazines and four loaded pistols.Police arrested Morten on suspicion he was harboring a fugitive, officials said.The children were turned over to state child-welfare workers.“The children are in our custody, and our No. 1 priority right now is their health and safety,” said New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department Secretary Monique Jacobson in a statement.“We will continue to work closely with law enforcement on this investigation.”A version of this story originally appeared on The New York Post. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yes it is its largest military player. Yes we are a cultural powerhouse. Yes we are their biggest individual market. Britain is powerful - but the EU is more powerful than we are.On paper - this should not be surprising, yet no politician, of any stripe, would ever dare say it.But the facts speak for themselves: We are 65 million of a bloc of 450 million. Ours is a $2.9trn (\u0026#1632.2trn) economy, they are $19trn (\u0026#16314.6trn) They represent 44% of our exports. We, just 9% of theirs. They are 27 - we are one.The impact of a no deal (as all the studies show) would be considerable but they have a crucial advantage: they are able to spread the risk and burden. For that reason, the same studies show, it would hurt us far more. We have nowhere else to turn.This should not be surprising. Imagine another country taking Britain\u0027s place - that we had \u0027Frexit\u0027 or \u0027Nexit\u0027 or \u0027Spexit\u0027 or even \u0027Deutschexit\u0027, ask yourself where the power would lie. It would be with the remaining states of the union.That we struggle to come to terms with that is, I think, deeply revealing of the British psyche.This imbalance was obscured through years of membership - we had no need to confront our own relative weakness as a member of the club - but now we are outside, that asymmetry of power is exposed for all to see.That is why we have accepted concession after concession, not because of Theresa May\u0027s pusillanimity but because of the hard truths of realpolitik.That is why Mrs May and her ministers have been conducting a grand tour of Europe. Not because they want yet more sea bass and asparagus in yet another state dinner, but because they recognise how powerful they are as a bloc and how isolated we are in their face.They want to tear them asunder, to divide and conquer - this is what David Davis said would happen during the referendum. Yet, they have remained, in 18 months a united set of two, while our own house, our own government, has been fatally divided.Time and again throughout our history, Britain has acted to prevent the emergence of a hegemonic power which controlled all of Europe, aware that Britain, even with an empire, could not resist a united continent\u0027s gravitational pull. Today\u0027s crop of politicians, seem to have forgotten that lesson. Looked at through the psychology of the British public\u0027s collective psyche, we can see Mrs May as the Wizard of Oz - less powerful than her people think, or than our population would like others to believe.That is what is invidious about Brexit for British politicians - for the British public to accept Chequers, or something like it, would essentially be to ask the British people to accept a downgrade of their own view of British power, a downgrade of the sort of country we think we should be and that we think we are.We are not an especially jingoistic nation, but that is much to stomach. It is a view which, however unfair, would be repeated and churned by the exact Brexiteers who, from Mrs May\u0027s point of view, forced us to accept the downgrade in the first place."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-brexit-fox_4381580.jpg?20180805182151 ","title":"liam fox faces ridicule over u turn on brexit no deal","story":"So what has changed? A lot, actually. The Chequers deal has bombed with Tory MPs and activists, including members of the PM\u0027s own association in Maidenhead.Two senior cabinet ministers, David Davis and Boris Johnson, have resigned, with Mr Davis\u0027s former lieutenants Steve Baker and Stewart Jackson now acting as pro-Brexit attack dogs.Mr Johnson, meanwhile, is now firmly re-installed as the darling of the Tory grassroots and the hot favourite with the activists to replace Mrs May as party leader and prime minister.Then there has been the reaction to the Chequers deal from Michel Barnier, accused by Dr Fox in his Sunday Times interview of \"intransigence\" and of making no deal more likely. In his lofty, patrician manner and with customary \"hauteur\", Mr Barnier picked the Chequers plan apart clause by clause, to the extent that even its biggest fans fear it is now mort dans l\u0027eau.And that\u0027s one reason why Theresa May was probably wasting her time when she went to the French president\u0027s Riviera retreat and told him Brussels faces a choice between the Chequers deal and no deal.When I went to Strasbourg for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s address to the European Parliament in April, I was told by senior MEPs that the president and Mr Barnier are extremely close politically.As a result, President Macron - probably the EU\u0027s chief powerbroker now that Angela Merkel\u0027s authority is waning - will ensure that his \"uncle\" succeeds Jean-Claude Juncker as president of the European Commission next year.No wonder President Macron told Mrs May at Napoleon\u0027s stronghold of Fort Bregancon that he was not willing to break the Brexit deadlock by breaking ranks with the EU\u0027s negotiators.\"There is absolutely no intention to speak in place of Monsieur Barnier,\" a French diplomat was reported to have said, confirming the president\u0027s close alignment with Mr Barnier.And so in spite of Mrs May\u0027s Riviera charm offensive, there has at the same time been a significant change in tone in the government\u0027s Brexit language in recent weeks, as the Chequers plan has faced derision and rejection. First there has been what Brexiteers claim has been a return of \"project fear\" scare stories, about stockpiling of food and medicines, lorry gridlock at Dover, long queues at border control and customs and fees for travel visas.But the biggest change in tone has come in the Foreign Office, where Boris Johnson\u0027s clown-like bluster and looseness with facts and detail have been replaced by the more thoughtful approach of Jeremy Hunt.Instead of Mr Johnson\u0027s gung-ho and cavalier approach to Brexit, former Remainer Mr Hunt has been deadly serious in his warnings of the risk of \"no deal by accident\" increasing by the day.Then last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney - denounced as \"the high priest of Project Fear\" by Jacob Rees-Mogg - said the risk of no deal was \"uncomfortably high and highly undesirable\".Are all these dire warnings aimed at putting pressure on Brussels to sign up to a deal? Almost certainly. Will they work? Probably not. But then some hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches have always favoured no deal.The danger for the prime minister, however, is that the more no deal looks likely the louder the calls from pro-Remain MPs and campaigners for a second referendum - a so-called \"people\u0027s vote\" - will become."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-weather-brighton_4380260.jpg?20180804130047 ","title":"make the most of it before heatwave cools off","story":"But the heatwave is set to end come Wednesday when temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20Cs mark.Met Office meteorologist Dean Hall said there will be \"quite a marked change to the feel of things\" when conditions turn \"fresher and more changeable\".He added that is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, with \"no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days\".British holidaymakers abroad have been warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated as temperatures remain especially high in some European countries.Last week, records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with the thermometers reaching 44C (111.2F) on Sunday.Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) over the weekend.The hot, dry conditions have led to several Portuguese wildfires."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-summer-sun-sunglasses_4381955.jpg?20180806104048 ","title":"passing on sunglasses you could be damaging your sight","story":"Luckily, finding shades that look good and have the right level of protection shouldn\u0027t be difficult.Sunglasses with UV lenses are widely available and carry the CE mark, guaranteeing they meet European standards for sun protection.\"We would really urge people to check that the glasses bear the CE mark to make sure they are properly protected from UV rays,\" Ms Ahmed said.The same survey found 78% are unconcerned about the impact of sun on their eyes, and less than half of people in the UK wear sunglasses with UV protection.For children failing to take precautions can be even more harmful, as children\u0027s eyes are not fully developed, and the Eyecare Trust estimates 80% of a lifetime\u0027s UV is absorbed before the age of 18.Despite this, nearly three quarters of parents say they don\u0027t take any action to try to protect their children\u0027s eyes from harmful rays, and a third said they had no idea if their children\u0027s sunglasses offered UV protection.Paul McMahon, an optometrist at Boots said children should wear UV-blocking sunglasses, though it was not necessary for the tint to be dark."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-amalia-taos_4381783.jpg?20180806031921 ","title":"starving children are found on us compound","story":"Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe, from Taos County, described the children as being kept in the \"saddest living conditions I\u0027ve ever seen\", with only \"a few potatoes and a box of rice\" for food.\"But what was most surprising, and heartbreaking, was when the team located a total of five adults and 11 children that looked like third world country refugees not only with no food or fresh water, but with no shoes, personal hygiene and basically dirty rags for clothing,\" he added.They were turned over to state child welfare workers for their own health and safety, police said.

But there is a key question at the heart of the EU side\u0027s thinking on Brexit.

Earlier this year former leader Henry Bolton said the party had been losing 1,000 members per month.\"It\u0027s obvious to the British public now that Mrs May is betraying Brexit and she\u0027s going to go on doing that, and that is causing immense anger in the population and a lot of people are joining us because of that,\" Gerard Batten told Sky News.However, the UKIP leader also claimed some of the increase in membership had come as a result of recent support the party has received from social media figures that have significant followings among the so-called \"alt-right\".He said: \"We\u0027ve taken on-board some people from the alternative media realm, who joined us by the way, I didn\u0027t invite them.\"They came on board because they like what we\u0027re saying, they like the things we represent, and that opens us up to a much much wider audience than we had before particularly amongst younger people.\" Mr Batten said that the social media figures who have joined the party would be bound by the same rules as other UKIP members, and would not be given any special treatment if they were to seen to make comments that might bring the party into disrepute.He also denied his own anti-Islam views and backing for former-EDL leader Tommy Robinson - who is barred from joining UKIP due to a previous affiliation with the BNP - would alienate more mainstream eurosceptics.He said: \"Those people have got an awful lot of things in common. They are the ordinary working people in this country that pay tax and the small business owners - there are a forgotten group in our country.\"I don\u0027t think the fact Tommy Robinson may have had a youthful indiscretion and joined the BNP cuts much ice with those people, they care about what he\u0027s talking about.\"Under the recent leadership of Henry Bolton, party membership is understood to have slumped to around 18,000. The current level is thought to be near 23,000 but a senior party source said another goal of the strategy meetings with alt-right figures was to raise UKIP\u0027s membership above its previous high of around 45,000 in early 2016.Speaking to Sky News in Grays, Mr Aker accused Mr Batten of blurring the distinction between concerns over immigration and his anti-islam stance.He said: \"The two things are completely different. Under Farage, when UKIP were riding high, the talk was about the Australian points based system - people want controlled immigration.\"Look around, Thurrock is a very mixed very diverse community - how could UKIP do well here?\"Because everyone here drives on congested roads, has to wait longer for GP appointments, and sees council house waiting list soaring by the week - now that\u0027s not pointing fingers at any one community, it\u0027s saying the numbers of people coming into this country are too high and we need to control that and the only way we can control that is by leaving the European Union that\u0027s the message that UKIP should be talking about.\"In the general election of 2015 UKIP received the third largest share of the vote across the country, although that only gave the party a single MP.In 2017 the party received just 1.8% of the national vote, and has lost the vast majority of its councillors in recent local elections.:: UKIP new membership enrolments since July 6 2018::: In the UK"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/06/2048x1152/skynews-france-suicide_4338303.jpg?20180617014907 ","title":"what is gaslighting and why is it so damaging","story":"Recently, gaslighting has entered mainstream conversation as we have gained more awareness about what psychological abuse is and how someone might use it.Some of the gaslighting techniques that abusers use include calling into question the victim\u0027s memory of an incident, trivialising a victim\u0027s thoughts or feelings, accusing the victim of lying or making things up, denying things like promises that have been made, and mocking the victim for their \"misconceptions\".This can make it difficult for the victim to recognise this form of abuse and build up the confidence to escape it.From our work with survivors, we know that abusers have even forced women to visit a therapist or GP to supposedly \"address emotional or mental health issues\" when in fact it reasserted the abuse and further undermined their psychological wellbeing.This form of abuse is insidious and subtle but some of the signs of gaslighting to watch out for include: if you are second-guessing yourself all the time, feel confused, find yourself always apologising to your partner, you are having trouble making simple decisions and find yourself withholding information from friends and family so you don\u0027t have to explain or make excuses for your partner."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-airport-airlines-stock_4381850.jpg?20180806075209 ","title":"wizz air revealed as most delayed airline at uk airports","story":"It said its ability to keep to time was significantly better on the rest of its network, and also cited \"particularly severe winter weather\" as a reason for why so many of its UK flights had taken off late.The delays were exposed by analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data by the Press Association, which showed there were two UK airlines among the 10 with the poorest punctuality records.Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional both experienced average delays of 21 minutes. :: UK airlines\u0027 punctuality records (Civil Aviation Authority, 2017)Thomas Cook Airlines - 21.1 minutesBMI Regional - 21 minutesEasyJet - 18.2 minutesMonarch Airlines (ceased trading in October) - 16.4 minutesLoganair - 16.2 minutesRyanair - 15.6 minutesFlybe - 14.1 minutesVirgin Atlantic - 13.3 minutesBritish Airways - 11.5 minutesBA CityFlyer - 11.4 minutes But most of the worst offenders were companies based abroad, with Norwegian Air Shuttle coming in second with flights departing 22 minutes late on average.But that does not take into account most of its long-haul UK flights, which are operated by a British subsidiary.Most of its UK flights are short-haul services from Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh.:: International airlines\u0027 punctuality records (Civil Aviation Authority, 2017)Wizz Air - 22.9 minutesNorwegian Air Shuttle 21.7 minutesVueling Airlines - 21.1 minutesAurigny Air Services - 20.1 minutesNorwegian Air International - 19.3 minutesEurowings - 19.2 minutesTurkish Airlines - 19.2 minutesAir Portugal - 19.1 minutesEastern Airways - 18.6 minutesBlue Air Transport Aerian - 17.2 minutes The CAA said punctuality was an important factor for passengers when choosing an airline to travel with, and they are entitled to free access to phone calls, emails, meals and refreshments if delayed by more than two hours.Delays of more than three hours mean passengers can claim hundreds of pounds in compensation - so long as the problems were not caused by \"extraordinary circumstances\" such as severe weather or a security alert.Consumer advice magazine Which?

The way they are behaving is making things difficult and if we end up with no deal we will make it clear whose fault it was.  Former Brexit Secretary David Davis added: The Lisbon Treaty requires them to come up with a workable arrangement. That\u0027s certainly not the description of their behaviour at the moment. Yesterday Trade Secretary Liam Fox claimed the intransigence of the EU was pushing us towards no deal.  And today Mr Davis claimed the EU is misjudging the UK and could make the massive miscalculation of causing no deal by accident. Theresa May met French President Emmanuel Macron at his island fortress on Friday night in a bid to come closer to a deal. It\u0027s understood only a tight-knit circle of advisors were present including Brexit chief Olly Robbins. Downing Street today did not confirm or deny whether it believed the EU could be breaching the Lisbon Treaty. But a spokesman repeatedly emphasised the “need for the EU to respond” - and hit out at “deep-seated ideology” on the EU side. Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “The Prime Minister has in the past set out the importance of being pragmatic and practical in the negotiations.

Anarchist symbols, ****head and shut up and die were also scrawled on the Old Etonian\u0027s country home as he took a holiday in New York. Condoms were left strewn over the garden of the house in West Harptree, Somerset, while the word t**t was painted on an umbrella stand.  Avon and Somerset Police are investigating the vandalism, which the 49-year-old MP claimed was a drunken protest and was reportedly discovered by his maid. The incident last Wednesday happened while the father-of-six, who is the son of a peer and married into landed gentry, was spotted in a double-breasted suit with his children in the Big Apple.  Mr Rees-Mogg is the leader of the hard Brexiteer European Research Group and firm Catholic, opposing abortion even for women who have been raped. A police spokesman declined to confirm whether officers were treating the incident - including the condoms - as religiously aggravated. Mr Rees-Mogg said: It appears to be someone who can’t hold their drink - and probably not Catholic. He added: I do not think it advances political debate and it is unclear what particular point they wanted to make. Fortunately everything has been cleaned up so the consequences are minimal. It is probably drunken excess. An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said: “We’re investigating a report of criminal damage at a property in West Harptree.  “The incident happened sometime between 4pm on Wednesday, 1 August and 8am on Thursday 2 August. “Graffiti was sprayed on a building and a car, while damage was also caused to the garden. “House to house enquiries have been carried out while crime scene investigators have attended. “Enquiries are ongoing.” Mr Rees-Mogg is the son of a former Times newspaper editor and amassed a vast fortune through his City firm Somerset Capital Management.

Caryn Walker, now 47, suffered years of horrific, systematic abuse at the hands of twisted Norman Yeo, who was jailed for 16 years in 2011. Now courageous Caryn, from Merseyside, has one message for her caged father - I made it. You didn\u0027t break me. I’m still here. The victim changed her former name to rid herself of its association with her callous abuser, the Liverpool Echo reports. She altered the spelling of her first name and took her grandmother’s surname.  She also refers to her father as “Norman” rather than “dad”. And in a bid to help other victims find their voice again and overcome the trauma of abuse, Caryn has courageously waived her right to anonymity and written a book called Tell Me You’re Sorry, Daddy.  In harrowing detail, the daughter documents her ordeal and how she overcame the trauma of sexual abuse as a child. Yeo was jailed for 16 years after being told by Judge John Phipps that he had ruined his – then unnamed – victim’s childhood, while his actions had also affected her entire life. Yeo, who was from Wallasey but living in Leeds at the time of his arrest, had admitted 10 charges of indecently assaulting Caryn. But he denied rape and claimed his abuse began after she turned 11, rather than at a younger age. His denials forced his daughter to relive her ordeal in court. Jurors rejected Yeo’s defence and found him guilty of a series of rapes, which reflected a course of conduct from when she was aged nine up to 16. And in addition to the previously admitted charges of indecent assault, they also convicted him of a series of indecent assaults beginning in 1979, when she was just eight. Judge Phipps told Yeo, who showed no emotion, that he had “secured the child’s silence, initially by telling her it was normal behaviour and later by subtle pressure”. Seven years on, softly-spoken Caryn told the ECHO: “It was a hard decision to write the book. Over the whole process I have been afraid of people’s reactions.  But when I decided to do it I knew it was for the right reasons – and the reasons were stronger than my worries.”  Heartbreakingly, in parts of the book, Caryn directly addresses her much-loved and much-missed big sister, Jenny, who spent most of her childhood in care, starting from the age of just 18 months. She died of a brain aneurysm in 2006, aged 36. Caryn says: “I wanted to give Jenny the voice she never had, and for her to be acknowledged. I also want to help others who may have gone through what I have been through – or are still going through it. I want to help them find THEIR voice. “I want to tell them ‘It doesn’t matter what anyone else says, you can do it. After 30 years, with just your voice alone, you CAN get justice’. “I proved you can.” In her book, Caryn bravely documents the beginning of her nightmare – and it is so painful to read. “And there he was. My father. At my bedroom door. ‘Look,’ he whispered, and opened a magazine he had on his lap. It was full of pictures. Pictures of naked women. It was very explicit, I know that. ‘Look,’ he kept saying, ‘look.’ His eyes flitted from the pages to me, back and forth, back and forth. I had no idea what he wanted from me. Would I get into trouble for looking, or for not looking? When he didn’t get a reaction from me, he started talking about them, the women in the magazines, telling me I would be like that soon. I was eight. I was only a little girl. I didn’t want to see naked bodies.  A touching father and daughter moment. My first experience of pornography, my first real exposure to what his twisted mind enjoyed.  He was back the next night, but this time there was no magazine. He said the thing he would keep saying for years. ‘All dads do this with their little girls. It’s normal. Everyone does it’. He started by touching me, then he got bolder. \u0027This is what dads do with their little girls. You’ll thank me when you’re older.’ It impacted on everything. From that moment on, I always felt I wasn’t good enough, that I was a bad girl who no one would like. I felt stupid and scared and filthy.” Today, she says: “I still live it – every day. But I am more clear now about what it was. It was something done TO me – it wasn’t my responsibility or my fault. Before, I’d always carried a feeling of guilt about it. “Now I know speaking out really is the first step to recovery. I am a different person today. I have shifted my guilt and shame.” Caryn went to the police in 2010, when she was 39, after a chance encounter with Yeo during a visit to see her grandmother in a Kirkdale nursing home: “It occurred to me I didn’t know who he lived with – who he had access to. It wasn’t because of what he did to me but because of what he might do to someone else.” She adds: “I always thought I would never be strong enough (to report him) and it wasn’t an easy decision – it was only on my third visit to the police station that I went in.” And she also recalls: “I was so damaged at that time that I actually called Norman and apologised – not for going to the police but because other members of the family now knew about it. I wouldn’t do that today, but I felt so full of guilt and shame at the time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best photos charlie van straubenzee","story":"Best photos from Charlie van Straubenzee and Daisy Jenks\u0027s wedding - with Meghan Markle and Prince Harry among the guestsThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were joined in the congregation by Harry\u0027s cousin Princess Eugenie and other friends and family of his schoolmate and his brideShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTom Howell18:22, 4 AUG 2018Updated20:04, 4 AUG 2018NewsThere may have been royalty among the guests, but this was Daisy Jenks and Charlie van Straubenzee\u0027s big day.

Anna and Laura Perry, from Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, say fliers end up thinking they\u0027re \u0027seeing double\u0027 when they spot them together. The stunning 23-year-olds even swap shifts to work together on flights - and also enjoy the exact same snacks, clothes, and car. In fact, they spend every minute of every day together and say they wouldn\u0027t have it any other way. Laura and Anna - who are also best friends - enjoy dressing the exact same for work.  And although there are slight physical differences between them, they claim passengers are always left baffled. The twins said: We rarely do anything without each other and we are definitely identical in every single way. When we both decided to apply to work for Virgin Atlantic we both said we wouldn\u0027t accept the job unless the other twin got the role too. Being air hostesses together is a dream come true and people are always asking us if they\u0027re seeing double which is funny. They will say things like \u0027I swear I just saw you down the end of the plane, how did you get here so quick.\u0027 It\u0027s amazing being able to share everything together as we\u0027re best friends and enjoy exactly the same things.  We chose to dress the same most of the day as we love being identical twins and being approached by strangers who are baffled by our similarities. We even love the same food and interests so you\u0027ll often find us snacking on the same things and shopping together. Anna and Laura - who still live in their family home despite flying from Heathrow Airport each week - will swap shifts with other members of Virgin Atlantic crew to ensure they\u0027re on the same flights. Anna said: We love flying together as we\u0027re able to travel the world with each other and share the most amazing experiences. We love visiting San Francisco and seeing all the sights on our days off.  Me and Laura are basically the exact same person and when wearing our uniforms it\u0027s crazy how many people approach us about being twins. We love all of the attention being identical twins brings and we feel so lucky to have our dream job together too. Growing up we\u0027ve always been very similar and although we can tell physical differences between us, most people can\u0027t. The pair have recently started documented their identical lives and adventures on social media. Anna said: We noticed other twins on Instagram setting up pages about their identical lives so we decided to do the same.

Mum-of-two Adele Burns, 47, says she suffered a life-changing emergency after what was meant to be a special day of pampering.  Stylists at Rainbow Room International in Glasgow washed her hair six times after failing to get the colour right - and less than 24 hours later, Adele suffered a massive stroke. The Daily Record reports that medics linked it to her head being repeatedly pulled backwards into the salon basin, which allegedly did not have protective padding. Adele, from Mid Calder in West Lothian, hopes the court action – the first of its kind in Scotland – will force change.  She believes salon bosses should be more accountable and that standards must improve to protect the public.  Adele said: “My life has been turned upside down from what was meant to be a rare day out. “With backing from my doctors, there is no doubt in my mind the salon caused the stroke. “This hasn’t just left me isolated from society, I’ve been isolated from my own body.” Adele visited the salon off George Square in April 2016 for a \u0026pound200 cut-and-colour as part of a day out arranged by her husband Campbell, 52. After the five-hour appointment, she left with a headache but put it down to not getting a chance to eat. The next day, Adele’s condition deteriorated. She felt dizzy and lost her sight while cleaning the bathroom. She rested for a minute before crawling to a phone to call Campbell for help. However, she dropped the phone mid-conversation and passed out.  Terrified Campbell rushed home and found Adele was unable to speak or move. The right side of her face was drooping and he called for an ambulance. At St John’s Hospital in Livingston, it was confirmed that Adele suffered a stroke following dissection of the vertebral artery – a clot caused by trauma in the neck which stops blood getting to the brain. The incident left her unable to drive, which meant she couldn’t work and the couple had to sell their home. Adele now struggles to speak, read, write and move but is determined to rebuild her life. She added: “A stroke isn’t like a leg break where you take time out and heal then carry on as normal. It changes your life and the lives of those around you. “I’ve completely lost my independence and sometimes feel like my life is no longer my own. “Campbell is my best friend and does everything for me nowadays.  “What makes it harder to stomach is that what our lives have become was avoidable. “I just don’t want anyone else to experience what is happening to us.” IT manager Campbell said: “Adele was an active and vibrant person. The hardest thing for me isn’t taking on domestic duties, it’s seeing her fight to keep the sparkle in her smile and eyes. “I see myself as a problem solver who does what is needed to help us clear obstacles. It breaks my heart when I think this is one problem I’ll never be able to solve for my wife. The salon should be ashamed – not just for what they did but what they are doing now by dragging her through a stressful and avoidable legal action.” Court papers state salon staff didn’t ask Adele to attend a “strand test” before her appointment, which would have prevented the need for her hair to be re-washed and re-coloured six times. Documents also accuse the salon of negligence by failing to offer Adele a front-facing sink or provide neck protection during the treatment.

We received a report at around 5pm that an 18 month old boy had been seen walking alone in the area. The boy was taken to hospital for checks and after extensive house to house enquiries, the boy’s mother was located.  No one has been arrested and police are continuing to work with the family and social services to ensure the long term safety of the young boy. The incident comes three days after a man and woman were arrested after a toddler was found in the street alone at night.

The UK has basked in weeks of glorious sunshine, with temperatures climbing to the staggering mid-to-high 30s in many parts. But while the next few days could see the sizzling sunshine continue, with a predicted 34C in Essex or Norfolk, things are likely to cool off as we head towards a damp and dreary weekend. Much of Scotland and Northern Ireland will start the week with some rain, before cloud and thundery showers moves across the rest of the country, forecasters say.   Met Office forecaster Dean Hall said the week will bring quite a marked change to to the feel of things, with fresher and more changeable weather, reports the . The Met Office long range forecast for August 9 to 18 read: “Thursday will see a mixture of sunny spells and showers across the UK, with the most frequent showers in northern parts. “There is a small chance of some heavy and perhaps thundery rain affecting some eastern parts before clearing on Friday. “Western areas are expected to see thicker cloud and outbreaks of rain on Friday, these will then move east through the day. “As we look ahead to the middle of August, fresher and changeable conditions are expected across all parts with spells of cloud and rain followed by brighter interludes with a few showers.     How to turn yellow lawn green again and the reasons your grass might not be looking its best  The heaviest rain is likely in the northwest with the best of the drier weather in the southeast. Temperatures will be around average, though it will feel cool at in the northwest.” England and Wales are to stay generally dry and warmer, with the exception of possible thunderstorms across the south east on Tuesday. But while temperatures are set to remain hot for the beginning of the week, the mercury will need to climb significantly if it is to come close to England\u0027s current August record - 38.5C (101.3F) reached in Faversham, Kent, in 2003. However, maximum temperatures are likely to dip to around the mid-20Cs mark come Wednesday. Forecaster say is likely to stay cooler throughout next weekend, with no real sign of any return of the heat that we have been seeing over the recent days.  It comes amid a sweltering European heatwave, with holidaymakers in Portugal and Spain feeling the brunt of the sun. The mercury is being driven higher by a hot air mass moving north from Africa, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert. British holidaymakers abroad are being warned to avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day and to keep hydrated. Last week local records were smashed in eight areas of Portugal, while Lisbon broke a 37-year-old record with the thermometers reaching 44C (111.2F) on Sunday. Red health alerts for extreme heat have been issued for more than half the country, with thermometers passing 46C (114.8F) over the weekend. The hot, dry conditions led to several Portuguese wildfires. In Spain, heat warnings were issued for 41 of the country\u0027s 50 provinces.

But don’t panic sun-seekers - forecasters are predicting the sweltering summer of 2018 could last until October. The Met Office has told baking Britons to prepare for an Indian summer that could break previous records. Temperatures are due to soar as high as 33C tomorrow and Tuesday making the UK hotter than the Maldives. It is thanks to a plume of hot air from the continent and continuing high pressure over most of Western Europe. The same weather system brought record 46C heat to parts of Portugal and Spain over the weekend.  El Grenado in Spain recorded the highest temperature of 46.6C on Saturday afternoon. It fell short of Europe’s hottest ever temperature of 48C, which was set in Athens, Greece, in August 1977. Things are to cool down later this week - with thunderstorms predicted for parts of the south by Tuesday. Some areas will a 10C drop in temperatures, with Carlisle struggling to reach 16C by Friday. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “It’s certainly been a true hot spell in Spain and Portugal.  “We’ll tap into some of that very hot air across the continent on Monday and Tuesday. “But thunderstorms are a risk on Tuesday and into Wednesday in the South. “There is the potential for travel disruption from torrential downpours, lightning, hail and gusty winds, with fresher temperatures following.” Forecasters say it will only be a temporary blip and are predicting more hot weather in the latter part of August. The Met Office says the UK is much more likely to see hotter than normal temperatures until October. July’s average UK maximum temperature was 22.5C, hotter than the summer of 1976, which recorded an average of 21.6C.  Sun-seekers made the most of the weather by heading to British seaside resorts over the weekend. More than 400,000 visitors flocked to Brighton, where the annual Pride festival was taking place. A further 200,000 tourists travelled to Bournemouth and 175,000 in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Our record-breaking summer has helped seaside resorts pocket bumper profits. Bournemouth has already hit its annual income target for beachfront attractions four months early. Hotels and restaurants in the UK’s top beach resort are enjoying as much as a 40% upturn in trade.  One hotelier said guests have even started to reserve sunbeds by getting up early to put their towels down like in Spanish hotels. It is estimated that 100,000 people are currently visiting Bournemouth every weekend. But not everyone is enjoying the hot weather, with Britain’s islanders facing a water crisis. The heatwave has caused a water shortage headache for islands from the Isles of Scilly to the Outer Hebrides. In the Isles of Scilly the council has urged people to reduce their water consumption and drawn up emergency plans for rationing. It fears freshwater boreholes are so depleted that they face inundation by seawater, leaving them unusable for years.

The suspect, Michael Stirling, is the brother-in-law of Miss Eastwood\u0027s former fianc\u0026eacute John Peake. He was charged after the 28-year-old NHS worker\u0027s body was found by police searching rural land near to a quarry in Caverswall, Staffordshire on Saturday. Miss Eastwood\u0027s family have thanked the public for their support and those who tried their best to help after she had vanished. Who was Samantha Eastwood?  Miss Eastwood, from Stoke-on-Trent Live, was a midwife who worked at Royal Stoke University Hospital. During the search, her sister Gemma, 26, made an emotional appeal, describing the midwife as a happy and bubbly woman who was warm and generous with a great sense of humour. Gemma said colleagues described her sister as an amazing midwife, adding: She\u0027s caring, harmless and gentle. She\u0027s generous and will do anything for anyone before herself. When did she go missing?  Miss Eastwood, also known as Sam, disappeared after she was last seen leaving a night shift at Royal Stoke University Hospital at 7.45am on July 27. Her colleagues raised concerns at 7.20pm later that day after she failed to show up for her night shift - something police say was completely out of character. CCTV showed her leaving work and then driving away in her car, but that was the last confirmed sighting revealed by police.  Detectives said her car was found parked outside her house in Baddeley Green, Stoke, and her keys and bank cards were inside the home. The only item that appeared to be missing was her Radley purse, police revealed last week. After she was reported missing, police launched a massive search and made a number of public appeals to find her. Where was her body found?  Miss Eastwood\u0027s body was found by police searching rural land near to a quarry in Caverswall, Staffordshire at around midday on Saturday. It came a day after Gemma broke into tears as she urged people with information about her sister\u0027s whereabouts to contact investigators. Police had described it has a high-risk missing persons case before the discovery of Miss Eastwood\u0027s body. What was the cause of death? Police were expected to reveal the cause of death on Monday, Stoke-on-Trent Live reports. A post-mortem took place on Sunday. But police said further tests were required. Who has been charged?  Staffordshire Police have charged Michael Stirling, 32, with murder. The Stoke man is the brother-in-law of Miss Eastwood\u0027s former fianc\u0026eacute John Peake. He made a brief appearance in court on Monday and was remanded in custody. Two men aged 60 and 28, who were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, have been released on conditional bail while enquires are ongoing. How are people paying tribute?

Amethyst Realm hit the headlines last year when she revealed she\u0027s slept wit 15 ghosts since breaking up with her fianc\u0026eacute 12 years ago. But now, she\u0027s decided to take things to the next level and is in a \u0027pretty serious\u0027 relationship with a ghost she met in Australia. The ghost, who Amethyst can\u0027t see but believes she can communicate and have sex with, has now returned with her to the UK and their relationship is progressing.  Speaking to Australian website New Idea , she said: One day, while I was walking through the bush, enjoying nature, I suddenly felt this incredible energy. I knew a new lover had arrived. She said: It\u0027s pretty serious. In fact, we\u0027ve even been thinking about having a ghost baby. I know that sounds crazy but I\u0027ve been looking into it and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s totally out of the question. She believes phantom pregnancies are actually \u0027ghost babies\u0027, claiming they don\u0027t go to term because the human body and mind can\u0027t process them.  Last year Amethyst appeared on This Morning to talk about the fact that she left her fianc\u0026eacute after he caught her having an affair with a spirit.   She left viewers baffled as she claimed to have had sex with 15 different ghost lovers. And a shocked Phillip told her: I could imagine you\u0027ve got quite a name for yourself in the spirit world. He had asked her earlier when she had her first sexual encounter with a ghost. She said: It was about 12 years ago now, I was living with my fianc\u0026eacute and he was working away a lot. She added: I started to feel a presence.  Amethyst says that one night she decided to dress in sexy lingerie and hang around in the spare room, where she\u0027d felt the ghost\u0027s presence the most. She said she waited a while before anything happened and feared that she\u0027d put the ghost off by coming on too strong. But she claims that just before falling asleep, the ghost turned up and they had sex. She said she\u0027s gone off men completely and has had sexual relationships with another 14 ghosts. But Holly asked if she\u0027ll feel that way forever, or if she may want children one day. And Amethyst said that she believes she can get pregnant by having sex with a ghost.

Now her stunned parents have hit out at the hotel where they were staying in Gran Canaria. Vicki Sutton, 39 and partner Neil Mullin, 50, claim doctors told them that their daughter Mya could have been killed by the allegedly unsealed glass door in Gran Canaria. The glass shattered against her body weight, leaving her stomach \u0027flapping\u0027 open, and Mya suffered painful three inch cuts to her abdomen and left leg. Vicki, a health and safety consultant, claims there was no rubber sealing against the glass - so when little Mya unexpectedly ran at it, the glass slammed against the metal door frame and shattered.  After rushing Mya to hospital, mum-of-three Vicki and partner Neil Mullin, 50, say they were told they were lucky their daughter was alive as the shards had torn her flesh to within millimetres of her bowels. The family had been enjoying the first day of their holiday at the Hotel Paradise Lago Taurito, which was recommended by their travel agent and provided by Jet2holidays. The poor little girl has been left with nasty scars on her body and legs. Vicki, from Cannock, West Mids, said: “It was traumatising. Thinking of the family holiday that it should have been, it just wasn’t. “The hotel had been recommended by our travel agent so I didn’t even think to check it out first – I just felt reassured it would be a good choice for all of us.  “It’s not like she’s a 15 stone bloke that’s gone through the window. Mya is a child and there’s no way she should have gone through that glass. “It was our first day there and we had got up in the morning, got the kids ready, and been to the waterpark. “We’d gone back to the room and she was in her swimming costume and an overthrow. We got all the kids in off the balcony, and shut the door. “We had the inflatables on the balcony so she ran out to go and play with the inflatables. Mya just turned and didn’t know they were closed and just ran straight through the glass. “She didn’t have anything in her hands, toys in her hand or anything that could have broken the glass first. It was just her. It was a shocker for everybody. “The rubber was missing from the glass on one side in our room. With the impact of glass hitting metal, there’s no way it was going to bounce back [against her].  “Mya absolutely froze. I saw it happen, so I just ran behind her and followed her through the glass and grabbed her to stop her hitting the floor. She was in absolute shock and didn’t cry. “I shouted to my partner who was in the bedroom. He grabbed her off the balcony and took her in. She had these lacerations to her stomach and legs. “My partner was just holding Mya. The stomach was kind of flapping, he said. “He wouldn’t let me have a look at it so I didn’t see the initial wound but he said we need to get her to hospital and we need to get her in now because it’s not good. “I had gone to pieces so I had to come out the room because I was making it worse. “The doctor said to my partner ‘you don’t know how lucky you are that she’s even here because it’s millimetres from her bowel. The fact she’s here, she’s got to have someone watching over her.’  “He couldn’t understand how she was here.” Mya was put in surgery to clear any remaining glass from her wounds and stitch her up, and remained in hospital overnight. Rated 3.5 stars on TripAdvisor, the hotel boasts a bowling alley, fun kid’s club and the island’s only saltwater water park and should have helped the family create memories to last a lifetime. But the family’s holiday was ruined by the little girl’s injuries – and poor Mya’s first holiday abroad was spent on a sun lounger watching her siblings splash in the pool. Vicki said: “The kids didn’t get a holiday. Mya couldn’t get in the pool. She couldn’t get in the water. She couldn’t even have a bath. “So we just sat round the baby pool and she dipped her toes in the water - but that’s about as close as she got [to the pool] for the rest of the holiday. “She couldn’t do the kid’s club or the dancing. We even took her to the beach and she couldn’t even build sandcastles because she couldn’t bend over.  “The best she got was the day before we came away we went back to the beach and she managed to get down for some sandcastles and we paddled in up to our ankles. “Obviously Mya spent most of her holiday with me because she couldn’t go in the water. She was just asking really random questions like, ‘Mummy, when you die, can you come back to life?’ “She was obviously sat thinking about things. But a five-year-old shouldn’t be thinking like that, should they? “Now she’s had the stitches out, she’s running round like any other child. You wouldn’t know to look at her. “It’s just when you look at the scar you think, god, how it could have been. Thank god it wasn’t her face or her neck because it could have been quite life changing. “In herself she’s absolutely fine now, but she’s very wary of glass doors. She said ‘Mummy, I don’t want to go through any more glass doors’. But Vicki was horrified that her child managed to run through the glass door in the first place and claims it never should have happened.

There were scenes of chaos and destruction across Lombok, the epicentre, after the magnitude 6.9 earthquake caused buildings to sway and huge chunks of debris to rain down as terrified people ran into the streets. A one-year-old child was among the dead, and there are fears the death toll will rise again. Large parts of Lombok were left without electricity and communications as the military sent medical aid and supplies, and airports were rammed with foreign tourists, including Brits, who were trying to leave disaster zones. More than 13,000 of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, and the scale of the devastation became clear after sunrise on Monday. Are you in Bali or Lombok? Let us know what you experienced by emailing webnews@trinitymirror. Bali earthquake: Devastation left behind after 6.9-magnitude tremor kills dozens Most of the dead were on Lombok where the quake hit Sunday evening, a week after a magnitude 6.4 tremor killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred hikers on the slopes of a volcano. Rosiady Sayuti, secretary to the West Nusa Tenggara provincial administration, told Indonesia\u0027s  TV that 142 people were dead. Officials had earlier put the death toll at 91, already making it the second-deadliest quake of 2018 and one of the strongest. The quake was so powerful that it rocked the neighbouring island of Bali, where at least two people died, and briefly triggered a tsunami warning. About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the north-west coast of Lombok, and it could take some time before aid and supplies reach locals whose homes were destroyed.  Indonesia\u0027s Red Cross said it had helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post in Lombok. One of the names she gave the baby boy was \u0027Gempa\u0027, which means \u0027earthquake\u0027. Agung Pramuja, head of the Disaster Mitigation Agency in the West Nusa Tenggara province which includes Lombok andneighbouring islands but not Bali, said many of the dead were from northern and western parts of Lombok. More than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening\u0027s quake, which was initially measured at a magnitude of seven but was later revised to 6.9. British holidaymaker James Kelsall, a 28-year-old from Woodford Green in London, and his partner Helen were left stranded at the palm-fringed Gili Trawangan after experiencing the second quake of the trip.  Speaking from a beach as he awaited evacuation, the teacher told the Press Association: There were lots of injuries and pain on the island from buildings that had collapsed onto people. The most terrifying part was the tsunami warning that followed. All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets. We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness. Cally Charles, from Devon, said that her partner Ashley Knight, 23, proposed to hear on a Bali beach just moments before the quake hit.  The romance quickly turned to terror as the disaster unfolded. The couple were in a lift at their hotel in the coastal resort of Jimbaran when the quake struck, and Cally described it as the scariest moment of my life. But reflecting back on what happened, the 23-year-old quipped: Five minutes before the earthquake my boyfriend proposed on the beach. He’s one of a kind he made the earth move for me.  She said: The whole lift was shaking. We got to the top level of our hotel (rooftop bar) people were holding onto tables and chairs. We ran down the stairs to the lobby where loads of people were stood outside. It was the scariest moment of my life. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was in the Lombok town of Mataram at the time of the quake, wrote on Facebook that his 10th-floor hotel room shook violently and walls cracked. He wrote: It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, whilebuilding was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors.  Residents of a northern village called Mentigi were forced to flee to nearby hills when the quake struck and flattened their houses.  Blue tarpaulins dotted the hillside on Monday as people prepared to spend the nights outdoors because of aftershocks or because their houses were destroyed. Marhun, a 50-year-old villager, was sheltering with his wife and children. He told Reuters: We are getting some aid from volunteers but we don\u0027t have proper tents yet. We understand there are other areas that are worse hit but I hope they can get the aid here soon. Hospitals were overflowing and some patients were treated in car parks amid a massive disaster relief effort.  Sengiggi, a seaside tourist strip on Lombok, wore an abandoned look. Amid collapsed houses, some hotels appeared to have closed, restaurants were empty and beaches deserted. Model Christine Teigen, who is in Bali with husband John Legend, posted on Twitter in the aftermath of the tremor: Bali. Trembling. So long. She had moments earlier written: MASSIVE earthquake. And her tweets continued: Oh man. We are on stilts. It felt like a ride. 15 solid seconds of \u0027hooooooly s*** this is happening\u0027. Take That star Gary Barlow was also on the island, posting on Twitter: Thank you for your concern - we\u0027re all fine - a bit shaken up.

In the street, we could still feel the earth trembling under our feet. As I type, we are now experiencing a little aftershock. Tourist Hannah Small told : We are saying in Ubud, our whole hotel was shaking and parts of the ceiling and walls were falling down. It was awful, we rushed from the third floor to reach safety. Australia\u0027s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel at the time of the quake. He told Australian radio: We were knocked certainly to the floor. We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone\u0027s a bit shaken but all well. On Monday, long lines formed at the airport of Lombok\u0027s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. Tourists pulled their suitcases past damaged homes and shops as they began their journeys home.  Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. The 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged, said at the airport: We are cutting short our holiday because I can\u0027t walk and we\u0027re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones. We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us. Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, said: I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two metres to the left, then two metres to the right, I could not stand up. His wife Maude, 44, told Reuters the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. She added: This is it for me in Indonesia. Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close. Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east.

The youngsters were pictured huddled together and wiping away tears as they comforted each other and tried to come to terms with the devastating loss of their only place of safety. For some, the ruined building was their home. The children\u0027s centre, named Peduli Anak and built in 2006, had been transforming the lives of underprivileged kids for more than 10 years. It had been giving hope and education to the children, some of whom have been abused, neglected and exploited. But today, it lies in ruins - with four dorms, the building\u0027s kitchen and a school having been reduced to rubble.  Luckily, none of the children were hurt in the massive earthquake as they had been safely in the prayer room when it struck Lombok. But last night, the children slept on the concrete outside, nestled tightly together to keep warm - a familiar memory for some who spent their lives begging on the streets before the charity rescued them. They were also left without food and have been sending desperate messages for help as the aftermath of the earthquake becomes more clear. It was a very frightening and emotional experience for the children who have already been traumatised by exploitation, abuse and neglect, said Chaim Fetter, who founded the charity after being so moved by the plight of children on the streets. All four dorms are either completely or partially destroyed. The children now sleep outside.  The kitchen has substantial damage and is out of service as well as part of the school. It is no longer possible to prepare meals for the children ourselves. They have been asking for food such as ready meals and biscuits, as well as essentials like water and milk.  This morning, the children were filmed sat in a row as they shared what food they could find for breakfast. They are still waiting for tents and blankets. The severe damage to the kitchen has meant they have been borrowing stoves to cook outside instant noodles for the kids, staff and volunteers. Chaim added: This week alone there has been over 500 earthquakes recorded.  When this earthquake happened this evening, our children were in the praying hall so they were all safe, but deeply traumatised. Our buildings are damaged and some have collapsed. Electricity has been cut off. They also urgently need anti mosquito repellent, underwear for the children, toiletries and torches. Meanwhile, an additional stove, gas, water, bread rice and milk arrived for the children this morning, donated by families in nearby Jakarta. Model Christine Teigen, who is in Bali with husband John Legend, has also contacted the charity asking how she could help.  A crowdfunding page has been set up here .  So far 142 people have been confirmed dead and more than 200 have been injured after the massive earthquake rocked the Indonesian holiday islands of Lombok and Bali.  There were scenes of chaos and destruction across Lombok, the epicentre, after the magnitude 6.9 earthquake caused buildings to sway and huge chunks of debris to rain down as terrified people ran into the streets. A one-year-old child was among the dead, and there are fears the death toll will rise again. Large parts of Lombok were left without electricity and communications as a tsunami warning was briefly triggered, the military sent medical aid and supplies, and fleeing tourists cut short their holidays. Thousands of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, and the scale of the devastation became clear after sunrise on Monday. Most of the dead were on Lombok where the quake hit Sunday evening, a week after a magnitude 6.4 tremor killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred hikers on the slopes of a volcano.  The quake was so powerful that it rocked the neighbouring island of Bali, where at least two people died. About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the north-west coast of Lombok. Indonesia\u0027s Red Cross said it had helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post in Lombok. One of the names she gave the baby boy was \u0027Gempa\u0027, which means \u0027earthquake\u0027. More than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening\u0027s quake, which was initially measured at a magnitude of seven but was later revised to 6.9.  Cally Charles, from Devon, said that her partner Ashley Knight, 23, proposed to her on a Bali beach just moments before the quake hit.  The romance quickly turned to terror as the disaster unfolded.

We are looking at new dates now to fulfil our five games.“Sometimes things are taken out of your hands and that happened a lot last season.“They cannot provide us with what we need and the deadline is getting close now.“It’s tough for a club of our size to get 35 players for every game as they must be played on a Saturday – which not everyone can do. If we don’t we get a yellow card from the league.”Thomson, however, is remaining positive about their chances ahead of the November 3 deadline.“It’s tough but we are still looking for as many players as we possibly can,” he added.“We are stuck between a rock and a hard place but we are going to do some try-out sessions later this month and get five games sorted before the deadline.“Hopefully, we’ll do the best we can and get the best outcome.”The Canes are hosting training and open try-outs at Charlotte Street on Sunday August 12 at 11am.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether 75 years on jackie aims to be at the opening of new harp ground","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe famous Beechwood Park is no more.Lochee Harp open their new ground this season, situated on the other side of King’s Cross Road from their original home.All concerned with this grand old club will be looking forward to their new adventure – and our resident Lochee thespian Andy Walker is excited about this, too.He opened: “At a Dundee council meeting in 1920, Alexander ‘Sandy’ Aimer stood up and demanded a football ground be built in the Lochee area for any team.“He kept this issue to the forefront of his career – and it eventually paid off. It took a while, but Beechwood Park was officially opened on April 26, 1941, and Lochee Harp were the tenants.“Harp ran out in their colours of green jersey and black shorts to play against a Hibs-Hearts select managed by Willie McArtney. The match finished 8-2 to Harp.”Andy confirmed that Aimer Square in Lochee is named after Sandy.Furthermore, where the Dee Club in Taylor Street is currently situated, this was at one time The Aimer Hall.As Andy went on, a soon-to-be famous name in this city emerged: “The talking point was all about right-winger Gordon Smith, who ran amok.“He scored five goals and, in doing so, absolutely destroyed Baxter of Hibs.”Smith, of course, would go on to sign for Hibs and become part of the legendary Famous Five alongside Bobby Johnstone, Eddie Turnbull, Lawrie Reilly and Willie Ormond.He would move to Hearts, and then to Dundee.History now shows he is the only player to win three top Scottish league titles with three different clubs.And, of course, starred as Dundee breezed their way to the European Cup semi-finals in season 1962-63.Returning to the Beechwood Park encounter, Andy continued: “In the crowd that day was avid Harp supporter, Frank Duffy.“Frank travelled all over Dundee to watch this junior team at various venues – Riverside, Lochee Park and Fairmuir Park to name but a few.“In tow, as usual, was his son John.“He remembers the buzz of that occasion.“As they left their house that day in Mitchell Street, a new journey emerged that would take them up Gardner Street, across Loons Road, and up on to the ‘Miley’. The ‘Miley’ was an unused trail that ran parallel with Kings Cross Road right to the new venue.“John, nicknamed Jackie’, was Harp daft, and hardly missed a game.“Indeed, his dream was to play for them, but this never happened.“He signed for St Joseph’s and his first cup final was against – yes – his beloved Harp.“It was the 1951 Courier Cup and they lost 3-1.“Shortly after, he was called up and joined the RAF, and it was during his National Service that a horrific accident saw him lie 18 months on his back.“When he recovered, he joined Lochee Hibs, and went on to captain the side.“He stayed with Hibs for many years right up until they folded.“Jackie reverted back to watching Harp, then accepted an invitation to assist with Celtic Boys Club in the emerging Dundee Sunday Boys League – a post he enjoyed for many years.“This meant he could still watch Harp on Saturdays.“And, of course, he helped Celtic Boys win many trophies.”Andy concluded: “In football, we hear about records, but surely a fan who was at the opening and closing of a ground during a span of 75 years must surely be unique?“Not only that, but, God willing, he will be at the new ground.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether simon spent christmas day playing in goal for alloa athletic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRegular contributor Sandy ‘Sy’ Thomson remembers playing in goal for Alloa Athletic in a Christmas Day fixture.He offered: “An interesting match that Alloa played was on Christmas Day, 1976, against Cowdenbeath at Recreation Park in a Second Division game.“It had an 11.30am kick off and was the only senior fixture in Britain.“Alloa won 2-1 in front of just 731 spectators.”Sy provided the line-ups and scorers, and the Alloa team was – Sandy Thomson Hugh McCann, Billy Wilkinson Brian McGarry, Frank Liddell, Euan Stewart Rab Russell, Gordon Forrest, Donny Wilson, Davie Miller, Billy Morrison.

I still remember that we went to see Django Unchained that night,” said Daniel.Becky, 26, said: “From then on we were together and things blossomed.”On July 6, after months of planning, admittedly mostly by Becky, the big day finally arrived, bringing with it the sunshine.Becky said: “The weather was absolutely gorgeous.“We had already planned an indoor area in case the weather wasn’t great, but it was amazing.“Luckily the actual ceremony was in a shaded area so I wasn’t too hot in my dress.“I was roasting when I was getting ready though, as the sun was beaming through the window of the bridal suite.“Getting ready with my bridesmaids Catherine Payne, Emily Payne, Vicky Carter, Reagan Crawford and Arlene Cumming was probably one of my favourite parts of the day.”Although the bride wasn’t feeling the heat, the groom certainly was in more ways than one.“I was roasting in my kilt,” saiud Daniel. “My favourite part of the day was seeing Becky walk down the aisle, though I did cry.“I was fine until I saw Becky’s sister Catherine and my bottom lip started to wobble but when I saw Becky and her dad Ronald come down that was it, I was away.”Daniel was supported by best man Sam Mailer and ushers Josh Payne, Garry Brock and Michael Crawford, but it was humanist Lesley Anderson – and a couple of glasses of bubbly – that helped settle his nerves before his vows and the greatly anticipated speech.He said: “Lesley was amazing. I don’t know how much she chatted to Becky before the wedding but she really helped me settle my nerves.“Everyone has been saying how fantastic the ceremony was.“I was a bit nervous before my speech but a few glasses of Prosecco helped that.“I loved my speech. I thought it was really funny, although Becky doesn’t remember much of it.”Becky added: “The whole day is just a bit of a blur, not just the speech.”At the evening reception the newlyweds swayed across the dance floor to Tom Odell’s hit Grow Old With Me before the party was in full swing thanks to the band Sneaky Treacle.The couple would like to thank them and photographers Burfly Photography, as well as their parents who helped with the planning.Becky added: “Organising the wedding was quite stressful but it was all worthwhile in the end.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b642080eb763-409x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united in safe hands for the rigours ahead says siegrist","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United fans will find out today which of their new goalkeepers has won the battle to start the league season between the sticks.And one of the men involved, Benjamin Siegrist, is happy to let them know in advance that whoever gets the nod, they can rest assured he’ll do a good job for the Tangerines.Whether or not it’s the giant Swiss shot stopper or Slovakian Matej Rakovan, Arabs are also safe in the knowledge they’ll keep each other on their toes all season.Since day one of pre-season training, Siegrist and Rakovan have been fighting hard to convince gaffer Csaba Laszlo they should be No 1 and that’s not going to stop with the visit of in-form Dunfermline.“You need to prepare every week to play,” said the 26-year-old former Aston Villa kid.“You train all week to play on Saturday, so, whatever you face, you know you have done the work during the week and you feel confident about facing it.“I want to play, that’s why I came here. So does Matej and it’s been a good relationship.“Along with Neil Alexander, our coach, we have a goalie union and it is a fun working environment.“At the end of the day we all support each other and, whoever plays, that continues.“It’s good competition and it’s good for the team.“We prepare in training and whoever is picked, they will do their best. This is the life of a goalie really.”And he believes whoever is in the team, they will handle the rigours of a Scottish style of play that is, in some ways, a change from what they’ve been used to abroad but in many others just the same.“I haven’t really found the games here that different,” Siegrist added.“The continental game, if you like, is a little bit more passing and moving than here.“They play it long at times here and quicker than you would get overseas.“I will kick it long but also play the ball out from the back.“It is important when you do play it long it is to good areas where the strikers can use it as a weapon and not just kick the ball up to the stands.”For Siegrist, the most important thing going into today is United are now approaching the game with a degree of confidence.His feeling is the new-look line-up is ready for the all-important Championship action and he sees last week’s convincing Betfred Cup win at Elgin City as proof of that.“Obviously, the results were not always there in the cup but I think we have seen a lot of improvement from game one to the last game.“We wanted to win every game, each time you step on the pitch that competitive edge needs to come out, but I think we have seen a lot of improvement despite some of the results.“We understand now how the gaffer wants us to play.“It takes practice in training as well and, at the same time as playing these games, we had to practice for a long season ahead.“There are no excuses but there were some tired legs in the games because we worked hard from Monday to Friday and then we had a game on Saturday.“Everything has to come together and I thought in the last game, especially the second half against Elgin, we put everything together and did a good job.“The physical part was there, we didn’t get tired towards the end.“We had some fresh legs coming on in the second half, we played good football and we scored goals.“It was a good game to get some confidence from.“We are now going in on a high, we have prepared well this week and we will give it our all.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united supporters society hosts race night for good

I’ve gone on record saying I can’t spend my entire time talking to the fan base but I needed to put in place something that has me speaking to them and listening to them.“The latter is as important as the former and I think I’ve done that. Some people will argue that I could have done more, some people will argue that I might have done less, but we’ve tried to get the level of communication and engagement right.“The final thing is we’ve not hidden anything. I can’t answer every single question that I’m asked but I’ll say that where I can answer, I will.”Perhaps the one troublesome area that remains for Martin and his board is with their backing of manager Csaba Laszlo.After the failure to win promotion, some want him gone, while it’s clear others are adopting a wait-and-see policy when it comes to turning up for matches.Despite a poor Betfred Cup campaign, the chairman remains firmly behind his manager and expects a rebuilt squad to be successful this season.“I said at the end of the season that Csaba was going to lead our campaign this year. We’ve worked with him over the last 11 weeks putting together his squad, his coaching staff and putting in place the other elements of the infrastructure he needs to execute his job properly.“We were very disappointed with the (Betfred) results to be honest. Every competition we go into, every match, we want to win and although it does come very early in the season with not much of a pre-season behind you, that’s the same for all clubs. We were in no different position so far as that was concerned.“I think where things were different here was the complete overhaul of the coaching and the playing staff and so we had the added complication of gelling the team basically.“We were disappointed with the outcome, but it didn’t wholly surprise us given the stage we were at in terms of rebuilding the squad.”Like his manager, Martin believes last weekend’s win at Elgin in the final Betfred tie shows the team is now gelling and ready for a strong promotion push.Even so, he does not hesitate to stress in the clearest terms what an acceptable conclusion to this season will be.“Win the league. The league is our No 1 priority, there is no doubt about that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"2018-european-championships-cycling-trial-glasgow-road-closures-in-place","story":"                          THOUSANDS of drivers and commuters are being warned to rethink travel plans ahead of a cycling event which will bring major roads to a standstill."},{"url":null,"title":"adorable-ferret-found-abandoned-in-box-in-motherwell","story":"                          THE Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after an adorable ferret was found in the middle of a road."},{"url":null,"title":"how-much-scots-workers-lost-in-unclaimed-expenses-last-year","story":"                          BRITISH workers have collectively lost out on a staggering \u0026pound962 million in unclaimed expense in the last year."},{"url":null,"title":"man-who-cant-stop-buying-things-when-he-is-asleep-feels-positive-after-making-condition-public","story":"                          A MAN with a brain disorder that sees him spend hundreds of pounds on \u0026ldquouseless shopping while he\u0027 asleep has told how he is feeling much more positive after making his condition public."},{"url":null,"title":"worried-residents-see-red-over-bid-to-build-on-greenbelt-in-neilston","story":"                          CONCERNED residents have launched a bid to prevent more than 100 homes being built on a much-loved field in Neilston."},{"url":null,"title":"serco-to-pause-lock-change-notices-for-asylum-seekers","story":"                          Serco has announced it will pause plans to issue lock-change orders to tenants whose application for asylum has been refused ahead of a court challenge."},{"url":null,"title":"olivier-ntcham-boost-for-celtic-as-tom-rogic-insists-celtic-have-enough-to-cope-with-aek-athens","story":"                          Celtic are cautiously optimistic that Olivier Ntcham will be fit to\u0026nbspfeature against Greek side AEK Athens on Wednesday night.

In addition to converting an equestrian centre into a holiday complex, the others are for a farm house, a detached house and an agricultural shed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"These may herald even more development in turn threatening to form a circle that, if unchecked, would eventually widen, join-up and constrict the core site protected by our charity,\" Mr Skinner said.He also cited the recent approval of a golf course at the Coul Links which falls within the Loch Fleet site of scientific special interest.He questioned whether either designation would still have any meaning if they were going to be run roughshod over by the current planning process.\"Culloden and the Coul Links are just two examples of a worrying trend,\" he said. \"Scotland\u0027 heritage is too often being cast aside for short-term economic gain.\"Four years ago, we argued for a planning framework which has the long-term wellbeing of our heritage sites built into it.

Journals headquarters inside the Marischal Square development.The move from the Lang Stracht back into the city centre is a historic one for the Evening Express and our sister paper The Press and Journal.From 1894 until 1970 the newspapers were based in Broad Street, on the site of the current council chambers.Journalists from the Evening Express and P\u0026ampJ made the move over the weekend and in the coming weeks other departments will leave the Mastrick building for the £107 million state-of-the-art development.As well as moving our offices back to the city centre, readers will also be able to place notices, pay for ads, buy merchandise and book holidays at a new Aberdeen Journals shop opening soon on Upperkirkgate.Aberdeen Journals – part of DC Thomson Media – has taken residence of the top floor of 1 Marischal Square, which will be home to more than 200 staff from editorial, digital, advertising, newspaper sales, marketing and commercial.Mike Watson, chief executive Officer of DC Thomson Media, said: “We’re thrilled to be moving the Aberdeen team into state-of-the-art office space in the heart of the city.“This move will provide the teams with a brilliant environment to work in, just a stone’s throw from the old Aberdeen Journals office on Broad Street.“Our investment in this space cements our commitment to Aberdeen and the papers that serve the city.”Alan McCabe, editor-in-chief at DC Thomson evening newspapers, said: “We’re delighted to be producing the Evening Express and The Press and Journal from our fantastic new home in the heart of Aberdeen.“Virtually everyone who has set foot in the new office has been bowled over and that’s down to the vision and hard work of Fiona Adam and her team at Covell Matthews and the fit-out team at Transform who’ve done an outstanding job, designing and creating such an amazing space for us.“We wanted somewhere that would inspire our teams and reflect the way Aberdeen Journals has changed from a traditional publisher to a modern, multimedia company – and we couldn’t be happier with the end result.”The offices have been fitted out in sleek contemporary style with quirky touches such as meeting booths fitted out as train carriages.Project architect Fiona Adam said: “The long history of the Journals in the north-east afforded us excellent design opportunities to include local references within the artwork timeline of Fittie, Dunnottar and Balmoral Castles and footballing legend Willie Miller.“Covell Matthews Architects have been delighted to have been involved in the delivery of the new office for Aberdeen Journals. It has been a hugely enjoyable and fun project working with such a terrific client, contractor and design team.”Other companies which have already moved into the building include Mackie’s, Costa, All Bar One and Marriott International, Tony Macaroni and Prezzo.Meanwhile, Royal Bank of Scotland will also make the move from its current home in the West End to Marischal Square this month.NHS National Services Scotland began talks in April to fit out part of the fourth floor of 1 Marischal Square.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"further 24 hour strike today on total platforms","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWorkers will down tools for another 24-hour period today amid a series of strikes on three Total platforms.An ongoing dispute is taking place over plans to switch offshore rotas from two weeks on, three weeks off to three on, three off.Workers on the Alwyn, Elgin and Dunbar platforms kicked off the strikes on July 23 for a 24-hour period.That was followed by a 12-hour strike action last Monday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise club staff after visit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tStaff from a north-east out-of-school-club have been praised for responding well to children’s needs.Inspectors from the Care Inspectorate visited the Schools Out Kids Club at Borrowfield Primary School in Montrose on July 16 and have now published their report.The club can look after up to 65 children aged between four and 16.Inspectors rated it “very good” for care, support and staffing – the second best of six possible ratings.“Children had nurturing and respectful relationships with staff,” said the report.It added: “Staff and children worked very well together with staff being responsive to children’s needs and wishes.“Children told us that staff listened to them and took on board their suggestions.“Children were happy during their sessions in the service.“They told us they enjoyed coming to the club, playing with friends and taking part in a range of activities on offer such as sports, arts and crafts, construction equipment and car tracks.”One parent told inspectors: “My child gets the care and social interaction that I am looking for after being in school all day.“She enjoys attending the club and is happy there.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon to visit turriff show to meet farmers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe First Minister was due to visit the north-east today as she urged farmers to air their views in a consultation that ends in nine days.Nicola Sturgeon was to attend the Turriff Show to demonstrate her backing for the rural economy amid concern Brexit could have a big impact on the livelihoods of north-east farmers.She said: “The rural economy is vital to Scotland’s economic prosperity but Brexit remains the biggest threat to the industry and our interests are best served by remaining within the EU or single market and customs Union.“Scotland’s farmers and rural communities receive valuable support from the EU and, in the absence of any clarity from the UK Government on future funding, the Scottish Government has published the most comprehensive Brexit paper on farming anywhere in the UK.“The paper proposes that, in the short term support schemes for active farming, food production, environmental improvements, forestry and rural development fundamentally stay largely the same.“It is important we hear directly from those working in the rural sector so we can support them through transition.”Visit tinyurl/ruralconsult to take part in the consultation, which ends on August 15.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/5b026386b2dc8-940x528.jpg ","title":"public to name new space","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTime is running out for people to have their say on the new name for an Aberdeen community hub.Aberdeen City Council has organised a competition to name the new Tillydrone Hub Operational Group’s community space and rooms within it.The council is reaching out to community members for ideas on what should be hidden as part of a time capsule burial.Work on the £6 million project on Hayton Road is under way and will bring together a range of services including a library, creche, IT area, cafe, retail space and a business start-up.Foundations for the new project were laid at an event on April 23, marking the start of construction for the state-of-the-art hub.

Apart from the technical information, which went a little over my head, it felt the same as before. The ground is uniformed, neat and tidy and it is so peaceful you feel like you are soaring in the air. It was simply stunning.”With nerves of steel, Chris piloted the plane and even had a back seat passenger, daughter Lesley.Lesley, 54, who works as a receptionist at Saks Hair \u0026amp Beauty in Union Square, said: “I knew my mum would definitely go for it and I was more than happy to go up with her then and will be happy to do so again.”Flying instructor Bill Anderson, who operates with Buchan Aero Club, declared Chris had “the knack” and she received hundreds of likes on daughter Lesley’s social media page for her efforts.So will Chris be seeking out her pilot licence anytime soon?“No,” she exclaimed. “But I can’t wait for my next lesson.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f4096fedf-846x564.jpg ","title":"students are driving force at legendary silverstone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn Aberdeen university motorsport team has raced its way to take 9th place in a prestigious competition.TAU Racing, run by Aberdeen University students, took home the accolade at an international competition held at the historic Silverstone race track in Towcester, home of the Formula One British Grand Prix.TAU, along with other teams from across the world including America and Europe, took to the track at Silverstone for the Formula Student UK event, celebrating the weekend’s 20th anniversary.Arran Strutt, the 21-year-old project manager, said: “We’re absolutely ecstatic to have placed where we did, especially given the obstacles put in front of us.“We worked out that it took our 60 members a total of 11,000 hours to put this car together from the ground up.”The cars themselves, which cost TAU between £20,000 and £30,000, are built and rebuilt from scratch every year, using the knowledge of the students.Arran admits that some of the pricier parts may be kept, but the majority is all brand new.He said: “Each car is built from scratch. We manufacture the chassis ourself, and fully design the car from the ground up.“Sometimes we might even use systems that we’ve designed as part of our course.“Things are held over, in terms of expensive components, but the whole design is fresh.”The team overcame a setback on its Aberdeenshire test track to take part in the competition, which took place between July 13 and 15. The day before the competition, during test laps, a wheel assembly collapsed, prompting the skeleton crew to replace it with one used on a previous car.Arran said: “It was a very tense atmosphere, we had a skeleton crew of about five or six there, and it took a really big push to get everything sorted.“It’s fair to say that they all did a great job.”Far from being an engineering-only event, Arran also spoke of how multi-faceted the competition is, with each team having to submit a business case, including costings to judges, as well as securing sponsors to cover the costs of the car.The mechanical engineering student said: “We have business students as part of the team, who are tasked with putting together a business case, as if we were going to mass produce the car.”Arran also mentioned the positive impact the team has on students.He said: “There’s a huge student development side.“Engineering students can apply theoretical knowledge that you learn in class on to the car, and you can learn other skills that you might not, like the manufacturing side.”Professor Igor Guz, head of the university’s school of engineering, said: “I am delighted that TAU Racing has achieved another great result in this year’s Formula Student competition. The result is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the team, and demonstrates the opportunities open to students when they come to study at one of the UK’s top universities for engineering.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b63f3d2cef31-796x564.jpg ","title":"worries about low uptake of council benefit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFewer than 40 young people in Aberdeen have taken advantage of a benefit that could see them avoid having to pay council tax.A new law, introduced by the Scottish Government on April 1, means care leavers aged between 18 and 25 can apply to be exempt from paying council tax.It was expected there would be between 6,000 and 7,000 eligible young people in Scotland.However, the uptake in Aberdeen has been just 35.The exemption is open to care leavers between 18 and 25 if they live on their own, if they live with other care leavers and those who have been looked after in some capacity by a local authority.If the care leaver lives with someone else who isn’t a care leaver then they may also qualify for a discount.MSP Kevin Stewart, who represents Aberdeen Central, has now written to Angela Scott, chief executive of Aberdeen City Council, to find out what the council will do to make sure all eligible care experienced young people are claiming the exemption.In his letter to the chief executive, Mr Stewart said he found the “extremely low” figure “deeply worrying”.He said: “The life chances of care-experienced young people was shamefully ignored for too many years.“The Scottish Government has grabbed this issue by the scruff of the neck and announced a review into the care system here in Scotland.“We await the full findings of the review but already the SNP Government has taken action and earlier this year announced a council tax exemption for care experienced young people.“Care-experienced young people leave care on average between 16 and 18, which is much younger than the average of their peers.“The transition to independent living is a major challenge for young people who have been in care.“The council tax exemption should help alleviate some of those difficulties and I’m alarmed that the uptake has been so poor in Aberdeen.“Aberdeen City Council is a corporate parent to all care-experienced young people and for that reason alone, it should be doing all it can to ensure uptake of this exemption.”A spokesman for Aberdeen City Council said: “We have received and acknowledged Mr Stewart’s letter and will respond to him in due course.“We are aware that, despite the exemption scheme being advertised in council tax letters to all residents earlier this year and a social media campaign, that take-up has been low.“We are currently looking at ways to further promote take-up of council tax exemption among care-experienced young people to help them live independently in the community.”City council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said: “It’s somewhat surprising that a government minister isn’t aware of the various campaigns highlighting his own Government’s change in policy.“Having sent letters to over 100,000 residents to raise awareness of the exemption, as well as a high-profile social media campaign, the council is fully committed to ensuring as much take-up as possible.“Once again, we have another press release from Kevin Stewart but no attempt at meeting with council leaders to finding solutions together. It seems while Kevin has the time to meet the mayor of Manchester, he isn’t as interested in meeting with us to bring forward his own ideas.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b6150949115d.jpg ","title":"cooper waits on smith","story":"\t\t\t\t\tInverurie Locos boss Neil Cooper is hopeful a knee injury to new signing Jonny Smith is not too serious.The striker had to be stretchered off in the first half of Saturday’s 6-1 win over Huntly at Harlaw Park.Cooper said: “Jonny took a knock early on to a knee and had to be stretchered off.“We’ll have to wait and see how serious it is, we’re hopeful it’s not too serious and we’re keeping our fingers crossed, but we’re not sure.”The Railwaymen fell behind to a Michael Clark goal, but Joe McCabe’s strike, Neil Gauld’s hat-trick and efforts from Stuart Duff and Chris Angus made it 6-1.The Black and Golds responded with Clark and Gary McGowan netting and Kai Ross being red carded.Cooper added: “It was a good three points and probably a fair reflection.“Huntly started better and went ahead, but we came back.“We were disappointed to concede at 6-1, we were a bit sloppy.“That was the frustrating thing for us.“But it’s great to follow up the win against Buckie last week with another three points.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mckenna good enough to star in england","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSkipper Graeme Shinnie has no doubt wanted man Scott McKenna could cut it not just in the Championship but the English top flight – although he hopes the defender stays at Pittodrie.Swansea have already approached Aberdeen to inquire about the availability of the 21-year-old centre-back.The Championship outfit are lining up a £2 million bid for the Scotland international before the transfer window closes in England on August 9.McKenna will face Rangers in the Premiership opener at Pittodrie tomorrow as the Reds aim to bounce back from their Euro exit.Aberdeen suffered massive disappointment when losing 3-1 after extra-time to Burnley at Turf Moor to exit the Europa League 4-2 on aggregate.Shinnie reckons the way McKenna shackled the Clarets big-money strikers, including £15m signing Chris Wood, proves he can hack it in England’s top flight.He only hopes that move comes a long way down the line and that tomorrow’s clash with Rangers at Pittodrie is not McKenna’s last for the Reds.Shinnie said: “Scott McKenna and Mikey Devlin were brilliant again in what was a tough task with the physicality of the two Burnley boys up front.\u0026#8220But they dealt with it brilliantly and that gave us the platform in the game.“Scott could go to a Premier League team (in the future), as he showed what he can do against a Premier League team in Burnley.“However, he is a level-headed guy as well and wants to rack up as many games as he can, which is really positive for a young player.\u0026#8220He wants to get the experience and wants to get the games.“There is no doubt he will probably end up going at some point but we will hold on to him as long as we can.”Aberdeen rejected an offer in excess of £1 million from Hull City for Scotland cap McKenna during the January transfer window. Since then he has made his international breakthrough and captained Scotland in a 1-0 summer friendly loss to Mexico.McKenna will be at the heart of the defence in a game against Rangers that marks new Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard’s first domestic game.After the disappointment of losing at Turf Moor, skipper Shinnie challenged the Reds to bounce back with a victory.He said: “Pittodrie will be packed for Rangers and it is a good game to have off the back of the Euro tie.“We need to put that (loss to Burnley) at the back of our minds.“It is a massive game but that is what it is like at Aberdeen – big games come thick and fast.“We know the crowd will be there in their numbers so it is another game where we have to step it up.”Aberdeen were up against a side with an immensely superior budget in Burnley, who have a £37m players’ wage budget.Tomorrow the figures may be smaller but there is still a gulf between the budget of Rangers and that of Aberdeen.The Ibrox club have backed Gerrard’s rebuilding by sanctioning transfers in excess of £5m during the summer.There have also been high-profile loan deals that will require high wages.Shinnie does not care about the cash the Ibrox club are splashing out, though.On the disparity between the two club’s budgets, he said: “That is out of our control and we just focus on ourselves.“The games against Burnley have been positive for us and we look to take that momentum into the league.”Aberdeen may have been knocked out of Europe but Shinnie reckons they regained some pride for Scottish football.It is a tie he believes the Dons deserved to win over the two legs to book a third qualifying round clash against Istanbul Basaksehir of Turkey.He said: “In Scotland teams know what we are all about – we have proved that over the last couple of years.“Maybe we have now shown people down in England what Scottish football is all about.“It is not as bad as what the English make it out to be.“But in Scotland, in terms of us, we have shown what we are all about.“We have got a big season ahead of us again to show that.”Aberdeen may have been underdogs against Premier League Burnley but, make no mistake, there was a belief in this squad they could progress.It was this confidence which made losing out in extra time all the more difficult to take for the Aberdonian, particularly as the Reds had opportunities to win the tie.He said: “We are gutted that we did not get through because that is what we wanted and what we set out to achieve.“No matter who it was against, we wanted to get through and we had the opportunities to do that.“It is disappointing but we will take the positives.“We can be proud of what we did… but it wasn’t good enough.“At the start of the game Burnley were good, although we didn’t start great in the first half.“Once we got to grips with the game, we got right into it.“In the second half, again, we didn’t start overly great but went on to be the better team and create the better chances.I thought, over the two legs, we were probably the better team but we didn’t take our chances and, in the end, that kills you.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinally in call to the blue toon","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeterhead boss Jim McInally says they need to improve after starting the League Two season with a 1-1 draw against Queen’s Park.The Blue Toon fell behind early on at Balmoor with Scott Gibson scoring for the Spiders.Rory McAllister restored parity before half-time but neither side could find a winner.McInally hopes he will see an improvement from his side over the next few weeks as they look to make a good start to the season in the pursuit of promotion from League Two.He said: “We do need improvement. At home I think your full-backs have a big part to play in opening the game up.“And because of injuries Callum Home was at right-back and he probably prefers playing at centre-back.At home he gets a lot of the ball, but he’s not used to having it in advanced positions.“That can affect the balance of the team. Our young centre-halves in Jason Brown and Cameron Eadie had a tough time against the strikers, but they came through it.“We need to get on with it and try to do our best and improve.”McInally added: “I thought 1-1 was a fair reflection of the game.“We lost a goal from a set-piece which gave us some work to do.“We played not too badly in the first half and created some opportunities and made it 1-1.“But the second half just developed into a nothing game to be honest.“It was really hard fought and we didn’t show enough quality to break them down and I don’t think they had many efforts at goal.“Queen’s Park are well organised.“In the League Cup they drew with St Mirren and were narrowly beaten by Kilmarnock which shows they’re not easy to play.“It was a game we might have lost last season so we have to move on and build on it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 1:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On the afternoon of July 2, my car overturned in Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig.Fortunately, I was not injured but I would like to thank the emergency services \u0026#8211 ambulance and police \u0026#8211 neighbours and workmen who pulled me out of the car after smashing the glass.Everyone was so helpful.I didn’t get your names but appreciate your help.We have a wonderful community here in Argyll.Anne Lavelle, Ardrishaig.Sir,I would like to thank everyone who made last Friday\u0026#8217s quiz night in aid of the Lochgilphead Celtic and Pictish Festival such a success.Thanks to Stan at the Stag Hotel for providing the room and a round of drinks for the winners.

With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing.

A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/07/18, 6:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe pages of the July 6 edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser contain too many stories of sadness and pain.

He played for two seasons at Murray Park, taking part in tournaments at Turin in Italy  and in Russia at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ralston, where he signed for St Mirren FC and had an enjoyable two seasons before returning to Lochgilphead Red Star YFC.Proud dad Dougie also happens to be the Red Star manager, and he said: \u0026#8216As a manager, it is always sad to lose your best players, but after the team\u0026#8217s success last year we had rumblings that something may happen at the end of the season.\u0026#8216As a club, we are delighted that one of our players has been given the chance to go and make an impact at senior level and just goes to show the hard work put in by the volunteers at the soccer centre, youth and amateur teams that there will be chances if players show the right attitude and commitment, whether at our level or at the youths.\u0026#8216Locally there are a number of youngsters who are with Partick Thistle, Hamilton, Rangers and others, which is great for such a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8217Taking off his manager\u0026#8217s hat, Dougie added: \u0026#8216As parents, both myself and Fiona are delighted.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine. Rally journalist John Fife was prompted to comment: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s like watching two spoilt weans scrapping over one tube of smarties.\u0026#8217Sunday saw a complete change in the weather and crews continued to battle it out in some very wet and slippy stages. Donald Bowness finished 11th overall and first in class two, followed by Michael Harbour in second. Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever. We need the evidence from these surveys to highlight the action we all need to take for the sake of Scotland’s seas.To volunteer visit www.mcsuk.org/greatbritishbeachclean or call 01989 566017.Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland Conservation Officer.Sir,The Tories’ hypocrisy on MoD wages has been exposed – after it was revealed that around 220 staff in Scotland don’t receive the Real Living Wage, just days after the Tories topped up the pay of some of the best paid MoD staff.An MoD Freedom of Information response revealed that 220 staff in Scotland earn below the Real Living Wage of £8.75 an hour – yet they are not in line to receive any pay boost from their employers. The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 3","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 30/07/18, 6:22 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Robin Morton provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features a popular subject \u0026#8211 the Paps of Jura.

In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

Inveraray had plenty shots but didn’t hit the target as often as they would have liked.They did get a fourth goal though when Allan MacDonald scored on 64 minutes.Bute 5 Kilmory 0Bute stay in the title race after they beat Kilmory 5-0 on the island.Bute attacked from the start and a combination of dogged Kilmory defending and wastefulness in front of goal meant the hosts only had a good Steven Dunn finish on 30 minutes to show for their first half efforts.When referee Des McNulty pointed to the penalty spot on 54 minutes, Iain McDonald stepped up to slam the ball home.Robert Walker scored on 63 and 85 minutes, either side of a 70th minute Craig MacKay goal, to complete the 5-0 victory.Aberdour 0 Inveraray 1Inveraray\u0026#8217s second team moved off the bottom of the table after a \u0026#8216smash and grab\u0026#8217 job on fourth-placed Aberdour.The Royal Burgh side travelled with only 12 players. Despite having a hand injury, 16-year-old Gregor Mather returned between the sticks after missing the previous week’s defeat to Col Glen and he would go on to turn in a man-of-the-match performance. Coll Mackay and Calum MacDonald, both aged 15, started up front.Aberdour started the brighter, creating many chances, but a combination of wasteful shooting and superb goalkeeping prevented Lisa MacColl’s side taking the lead.Inveraray’s centre line grabbed a hold of the game towards the end of the first half, with wingers Campbell Watt and Steven Cameron adapting well to their unaccustomed roles.Aberdour dominated large chunks of the second half but struggled to break down the visitors.Inveraray, though, have Gregor Mather to thank for some heroic saves to keep the scoreline blank.Aberdour goalkeeper Tom Bowerman had a quiet afternoon until 89 minutes when he picked the ball out of the net. Young Calum MacDonald, the smallest player on the park, ran through several challenges to push the ball into the back of the net and give Inveraray the lead.There wasn’t much time for referee David Mitchell to add and his final whistle signalled an Inveraray victory.Photo: Stephen Lawson\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters week 31","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 03/08/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,On behalf of local walkers I would like to thank the Forestry Commission for mowing the path between the Mealdarroch water tank track and The Kintyre Way.It is a beautiful forest walk and one of the least muddy in the area during the wet weather.Ann Thomas, TarbertThanks to the separatist\u0026#8217s tax hikes, Scotland has seen a 12 per cent rise in personal insolvencies.There were 3,208 bankruptcies and protected trust deeds from April to June this year, up from 2,869 in the same period last year.More and more Scots are struggling with debt yet the SNP has chosen to hammer families with higher income taxes.While taxes continue to rise in Scotland the revenue generated is being wasted \u0026#8211 a recent bullying claim probe into a police chief has wasted almost £100,000 of public money. The Scottish Police Authority disclosed the money spent on lawyers during the probe.Taxpayers have footed the legal fees of investigating the claims against former police chief Phil Gormley, who quit earlier this year amid multiple bullying allegations.The public was angry enough at how this case has been handled by the SNP Government and SPA, so it is even more frustrating to find out that tens of thousands were wasted on this fruitless task.It seems that the separatist\u0026#8217s wastefulness and incompetence which we have seen so much of in their mishandling of our economy also extends to their mismanagement of Police Scotland matters.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,With the Edinburgh Festivals about to start, can I remind your readers to helpfully inform visitors to our city that, unlike the made-up and damaging \u0026#8216tradition\u0026#8217 of rubbing Greyfriars Bobby\u0026#8217s nose, it is a genuine Edinburgh tradition to pause for a moment in the Royal Mile beside St Giles to lick the Heart of Midlothian.John Hein, EdinburghSir,I am writing to invite your readers to join me in hosting a World Tea Party this summer in support of working animal charity SPANA.Holding a Moroccan, Indian, British, Kenyan, or another world-themed party, is the perfect way to get together with friends and try out exciting and exotic new recipes, while also raising vital funds to help the world’s most hardworking animals.In many developing countries, working animals transport food, water, goods and people, and make it possible for millions of the poorest families to earn a small income. However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"jenny celebrates 90 years","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 04/08/18, 7:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowJenny Speirs of Inveraray recently celebrated her 90th birthday.She celebrated the milestone in style with a lunch party for family, friends and neighbours including cousins from Australia.Jenny thanks everyone for the lovely cards, flowers and gifts given to her during the celebrations.Donations in lieu of presents, at Jenny\u0026#8217s request, raised £300 for Cancer Research.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sheep and showers in high quality blackface show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 04/08/18, 8:01 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA high quality show of sheep was held at Cairndow amid heavy showers interrupted by fiery sunshine.The annual Cowal Blackface Sheep Breeders\u0026#8217 Association show at Clachan \u0026#8211 right beside the Loch Fyne Oysters complex \u0026#8211 drew curious (if slightly bemused) tourists and seasoned hill shepherds in almost equal measure.The sheep show has, in recent years, been supported by a display of vintage tractors and other machinery, and this year Cowal Vintage Transport Club and Bute Vintage Club provided the gleaming hardware for visitors to enjoy.You can find pictures of the vintage machinery show on page 34.In the show ring, the overall champion came from Dyke Farm, Milton of Campsie, with a young ewe by £24,000 Elmscleugh out of a ewe by a son of Travis.The reserve overall was a ewe by Buffalo out of a dam by a £4,000 Midlock from Messrs MacPherson, Balliemeanoch, Loch Awe.In the section confined to the district of Cowal, the champion was from Pole Farm, Lochgoilhead, with a gimmer by Spectre out of a ewe by a £5,200 Allanfauld sire.The confined reserve champion \u0026#8211 and best sheep of the opposite sex to the overall champion \u0026#8211 was from Messrs Campbell, Drimsynie, Lochgoilhead, with a shearling tup by Allanfauld Pogba out of ewe by a 40k Nunnerie sire.

The coach kit will also bear Ardrishaig Community Trust’s logo.The funding will also see more than £2,000 per annum set aside to allow teams to take part in football festivals throughout Argyll and further afield, and also to pay for festivals to be held locally.This will allow local youngsters to benefit from the experience of playing in festivals against a wide range of teams from all over Scotland, and help to tackle remoteness and exclusion.As part of the funding agreement, the Soccer Centre will display a banner recognising the role of Ardrishaig Community Trust as its main sponsor.The player of the year award for each age group at the annual awards evening will be dedicated to the Ardrishaig Community Trust.And, finally, the Soccer Centre will look to encourage, support and participate in the work of Ardrishaig Community Trust.

Before the roads were made these were important links- the sea unites and the land divides.Arguably the most important ferry followed the Inveraray \u0026#8211 St Catherines route, connecting with coach services to Loch Goil and the onward steamer to Greenock or Glasgow.At one time a large sailing boat carried horses and cattle. A rowing or sailing yawl conveyed pilgrims, pedlars, travellers and soldiers. Pilgrims and blind persons were carried free.From the 17th Century the ferry and ferryman\u0026#8217s house were auctioned annually by Inveraray Town Council to the highest bidder, with the burgh providing the two vessels. The ferryman kept the fares, and part of the deal was that the minister and magistrates would travel free of charge.When Inveraray new town was built in the 18th Century the Ferry Land housed the ferrier, who supplemented his income by running a dram shop. The Ferry Inn was a popular pub until 1917, when its licence was revoked.In 1827 David Napier, later a famous shipbuilder, introduced two steamers, the Thalia and Robert Bruce, from Inveraray to St Catherines and other ports on Loch Fyne. In 1836 the Lochgoil and Loch Long Steamboat Company became tenants of the ferry with a small paddle steamer, though the rowing/sailing boats were still available for a lower fare.From St Catherines their horse-drawn coach conveyed passengers to Lochgoilhead, from where they joined a steamer to the central belt.In 1856 the company introduced a new steamer, the Argyle. She was not a success, with author Alexander Smith describing her as \u0026#8216a small wash-tub of a steamer that carries you across Loch Fyne in an hour\u0026#8217.In 1865 the Inveraray Ferry and Coach Company took over with their beautiful little steamer, the Fairy.The route did not pay, however, and in 1892 the town council set up the ferry as a municipal enterprise with Fairy II, a little steel paddle steamer. When to town council gave up running the service in 1909, Mr John Dewar continued until the Fairy II was wrecked in the great storm of November 1912.Thereafter there were a number of ferriers. James Douglas used a Loch Fyne skiff fitted with a motor and Hope MacArthur operated launches called the Happy Return and the Jean.The car and bus rendered the sea link unnecessary and the service ended in 1963.A winter trip across Loch Fyne is recorded in the following song, sung to the tune \u0026#8216Kitty of Lochgoil\u0026#8217. Here are some of the verses:The Fairy in the Fog\u0026#8216Twas in the year of \u0026#821781On Januar\u0026#8217 the fourth dayThe steamer Fairy crossed Loch FyneTo Sweet St Catherines bay.Our Captain Bold was Duncan BellOur pilot Donuil DhuThe engineer Shon GilliesAnd Dugal Piobair was the crew.The passengers were soon aboardThat Coachy Jock had broughtAnd then again through blinding fogOur homeward way we sought.The day with fog was thick and darkYou could neither hear nor seeBut Donuil Dhu just kept her noseStraight from St Catherines quay.The pilot at his stemmy postStood firm as any rockThe compass true before his eyesJust like my grandfather clockAs we came near the Newtown bay.Our reckoning scarce could failSaid Dougal Piobair to himself\u0026#8216I wish we saw the jail\u0026#8217.The captain stood upon the deckA few feet from the funnelAnd to the pilot passed the word\u0026#8216Keep clear of Mackenzie\u0026#8217s tunnel\u0026#8217.Already we were sheering offOur course we knew quite wellWhen through the fog some lengths awayThere came a dismal yell.\u0026#8216Now what was that?\u0026#8217 the captain cried\u0026#8216I ne\u0026#8217er heard the like before\u0026#8217Said Dugal Piobair: \u0026#8216Sure it is a Pochkan on the shore\u0026#8217.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"crunch meeting on ardrishaig club future","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/08/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA meeting is to be held next month to gauge interest in reviving a Mid Argyll sailing club.Disquiet has been growing in Ardrishaig while weeds grow up around sailing boats and canoes belonging to Mid Argyll Water Sports Club.The boats, bought with the help of grant funding from Ardrishaig Community Trust, are lying on the Ardrishaig waterfront, unused in 2018.The Argyllshire Advertiser spoke to Peter Hogbin, who was involved in the club for many years.

The marquees provided shelter from the showers and a chance to browse the stalls.As well as classics like the bottle stall and guess the weight of the cake, there were representations from local businesses, voluntary groups and organisations, including the RNLI, Friends of the Sound of Jura, Heart of Argyll Wildlife and the 19th Argyll Scouts.After a break for lunch of paella, barbecue, sandwiches and home baking, the sun came out in time for the fabulous dog show, which featured novelty classes such as best six legs, fancy dress and the dog and handler race.Events moved into the hall on Saturday evening for the family ceilidh, where the fantastic Argyll Ceilidh Trail band kept the dancers on their feet into Sunday morning. The morning after, the focus moved to Tayvallich village pontoon for the world crab fishing championship.There are now 12 months of peace for people, pooches and partan until the next Tayvallich Weekend on July 26-28 next year.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13025651.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_lhr_ayp_300718ayr.jpg","title":"ayr united daft musician set","story":"NewsAyr United-daft musician set to donate cash raised from song to clubHonest Man Jason Skimming, who fronts the Seaside Sons, is getting prepared to hear his band’s new song United With Pride being belted out against Partick Thistle.Share\u0026nbspByLochlin Highet10:11, 3 AUG 2018NewsSeaside Sons (Image: unknown handout)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn Ayr-daft musician is giving something back to his beloved team.

Much the same reaction as when food is about and the hungry gulls swoop. South Ayrshire Council has just introduced tough metal bins in Ayr High Street that gulls cannot peck rubbish and scraps out. At the moment with starving fledglings about, some of the birds are highly aggressive. Former air traffic control staffer Dave Kennedy,65, of Ayr said: “Some people feed gulls and that encourages them back. They are a nuisance, feral and these bins are a good idea.” Christopher Cooper,32, is a care home worker who lives in the town centre and said: “I cannot even open my windows as they are too noisy and seem to go mental at 4am. I took a video and put it on Snapchat. Yesterday one stole a chip from my pal’s butty. More effort should be made.” Former council worker David Nichol,63, of Kilmaurs, said: “I don’t know much about ornithology but gulls they are so aggressive. “These bins are a great idea but if the gulls get worse here it will affect tourism. They are lovely looking birds, but they even fight in mid-air.” Retired council clerical officer Anne Russell,69, of Auchinleck, added: “The bins are great but the council needs to be more aggressive and take action against folk feeding them. “They have notices up about not feeding them - but people are still doing it. “We need a gull patrol like a traffic warden.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilKilmaursAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields two things must","story":"NewsBob Shields: Two things must happen at the Station HotelEmergency committee must be set upShare\u0026nbspByGary Fanning07:00, 5 AUG 2018NewsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“Ding dong . . . this is a Scot Rail passenger announcement . . . the next arrival at platforms one, two, three and four will be the 2018 death of Ayr Station. “This is due to Ayr Station Hotel deteriorating on South Ayrshire Council’s doorstep and no heads being on the line. “We apologise for any inconvenience and the loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds of your money. “The next train from a functional Ayr Station will the 2020 to Glasgow Central”. Yes dear readers, if all of the above was improbable – it might even have been amusing. But the demise and ultimate destruction of South Ayrshire’s busiest transport hub isn’t improbable – it’s inevitable. Last weekend, most of the United Kingdom was looking skywards for a glimpse of a “blood moon”. But on Saturday, I looked skywards as I walked across the Station Bridge . ... and all I saw was a bloody disgrace. Belts and straps have now been attached to Ayr Station Hotel’s chimney stacks in a bid to safely secure them. New areas at the Smith Street end of the station have been declared unsafe. The “no-go area” fencing that once cordoned a section of the front car park has been extended to barricade the entire building. If this was 1945, we could probably keep Rudolph Hess banged up in there! The harsh fact is that Ayr Station and its hotel have moved on from being a giant embarrassment to becoming the biggest threat to public safety, the local economy and the environment in South Ayrshire’s living memory. And what are South Ayrshire’s elected members doing about it? Er .... they’re all on their summer recess! On safety – is the Station Bridge REALLY safe for cars and pedestrians? A single lane was closed for “scaffolding work” – but it’s been scaffold-free for five weeks. If the gable-end chimneys need belts and buckles, is it prudent to allow the public to pass barely fifty yards below them? On the economy – I know my own business has been affected by the railway chaos. Many of my Ayr racecourse regulars by-passed the town centre and headed straight to the track from the station’s east side. And if I’m feeling it – God help the shops, bars, eateries and taxi drivers based around Smith Street and Burns Statue Square. On the environment – has anyone contemplated the dust, fumes and noise pollution that will surely come with demolishing a giant sandstone structure that’s visible from the Kilmarnock by-pass? MP Bill Grant was in my boozer last weekend – but on the first week of his hols, I extended the courtesy of letting him socialise with his friends. But I know he reads this page – and I hope he and MSP John Scott will be in agreement that two things must happen soon: 1) An Ayr Station Emergency Committee be set up involving all stakeholders – including structural and civil engineers, Scot Rail, South Ayrshire Council, road traffic management and local businesses. Its remit would be look at the entire station issue – and how best to fit all future works into the community. And if they can get Ayr Station Hotel’s owner to show up – a bit of public flogging wouldn’t go amiss either. 2) An independent investigation be set up to demand the facts from South Ayrshire Council on what they did – and didn’t do – as they watched an iconic town centre building fall into ruin right in front of them. And it has to be root and branch – every correspondence, every conversation, every e-mail – involving everyone from the Malaysian owners to our own Council executives and elected members. The council tax payers of South Ayrshire deserve the truth. And they certainly deserve better management of local resources than this current shambles .Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentTaxesAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket runs out 10p bags","story":"NewsSupermarket runs out of 10p bags in AyrWorkers had to resort to giving out more expensive bag-for-life style carriers in a bid to appease grocery laden shoppers.Share\u0026nbspByStephen Houston15:24, 1 AUG 2018Updated15:25, 1 AUG 2018News (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMorrisons in Ayr ran out of 10p plastic bags after bosses forgot to order them in. . . . that’s the claim by under-pressure staff.

The store is said to be among the most profitable Morrisons supermarkets in Scotland.

But vehicles needing access to Old Cumnock Old Church for weddings or funerals will continue to have access. These vehicles will have to show a permit to access The Square. Any other vehicles will be hit by a fixed-penalty notice if they flout the new traffic regulations. The move is designed to improve safety to pedestrians and cyclists in the Square. One community councillor said it would stop parking outside the hairdressers and takeaways at the Square: “Traffic in the Square will be limited,” he added. “From the beginning of August anyone driving a car would need to have a permit. “It will be limited to funeral cars, wedding cars for church services “The main thing is they are going to block off pedestrian crossing outside the Royal Hotel. “So the cars are going to have to come in and go back out into Lugar Street. “It is going to be mayhem in Lugar Street. “I suggested reversing the one way system at Hamilton Place and make it street pedestrian only.” Another community councillor asked how it would be implemented.

This will enable a Parking Attendant employed by the Council to issue a Penalty Charge Notice to any vehicle within The Square contravening the restrictions.  “Exemptions to the waiting  and loading restrictions are exactly the same as the access restriction.  “I do not anticipate traffic congestion on Lugar Street as a result of this Order. “The Order was promoted to prevent danger to pedestrians and cyclists in The Square. “The Order was advertised on Wednesday March 28 and received no objections. “The Order is fully supported by Police Scotland and they will be responsible for enforcing the restrictions.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPolice ScotlandCumnockAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kelso-woman-accused-of-being-involved-in-two-bust-ups","story":"A KELSO woman has been accused of being involved in two bust-ups.\nNicola Turnbull, 31, of Abbotseat, denies behaving in a threatening or abusive manner at the Vibe Night Club\nin Kelso on May 6, knocking over a drink, threatening another person with violence and struggling and fighting with another.\nShe also pleaded not guilty to assaulting a female at The Square in Kelso, by pulling her hair and repeatedly punching her on the face to her injury.\nA trial date has been fixed for October 4 with an intermediate hearing on September 3.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-borders-council-to-mark-merchant-navy-day","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council is to host a special reception to honour the services of Merchant Navy personnel.\nAnd Borderers who have previously or currently serve are being asked to come forward to attend the event.\nMerchant Navy Day is held on September 3 every year to honour the brave men and women who kept Britain afloat during both World Wars, and also celebrate the importance of modern day merchant seafarers.\nA civic reception will be held on the same day at Newtown St Boswells to mark the occasion.\nCouncil convener, Councillor David Parker, said: \u0026ldquoThe Merchant Navy was given its name 100 years ago at the end of World War I, with King George V acknowledging their efforts in providing supplies to Britain.\n\u0026ldquoWith this special anniversary, we felt it was appropriate to mark the efforts of our local personnel and would request any Borders seafarers to get in contact with us so we can invite you to the reception.\nAny Merchant Navy personnel from the Borders wishing to go should email CorporateMgtSupport@scotborders.gov.uk or phone 01835 826571 or contact councillor Sandy Aitchison \u0026ndash saitchison@scotborders.gov.uk.

An inn sprang up here known as the Brighous Inn and it was at this site that the famous Linton markets were first held.\nRobert Burns would visit Linton where he had a friend named Graham, the innkeeper at the Brighous. Twice he came but didn\u0026rsquot find his friend at home, so he scratched these words on a window pane of the inn: \u0026ldquoHonest Graham, aye the same, never to be found at hame.\nThe old inn was considerably enlarged in 1862, becoming Medwyn House, the home of William Forbes, a great benefactor of the village, who spent large sums in draining and improving the land. A new turnpike road between Carlops and Dolphinton had been built in 1831, and, as a result, a way-side inn appeared on the east side of the road called Rutherford Castle Inn.\nThe owner, James Greig, considerably improved the property and transformed the inn, which faced west, into the present dwelling house which faces south and is approached by an avenue from the main road.\nA later owner, Andrew Webster, extended the planting and enclosed a mineral spring, \u0026ldquoHeaven Aqua, less than two miles from Carlops.\nNot all the fine local houses around West Linton survived. Coldcoat or Macbiehill was one. It had a long pedigree, being built about 1600, but was demolished about 1950.\nIt was owned by the Hamiltons of Coldcoat and Grange the last of the Hamiltons being Alexander who died in 1697. Before he died he managed to repair the house and in so doing contrived that there were exactly 15 sleeping places in the house, so that he might have it in his power to accommodate the whole of the 15 judges of the Court of Session without the necessity of putting two in one bed.\nThe Coldcoat estate was then acquired by William Montgomery of Magbiehill in Ayrshire, who transferred this name which later became Macbiehill. Three of this family are buried in a mausoleum on the estate.\nAnother house that did not survive was Broomlee House. It was originally the manor house of Broomlee estate until it was acquired by Sir William Fergusson and absorbed into Spitalhaugh estate. After his death it continued to be occupied by his three spinster daughters until after their deaths when it was demolished and became part of the grounds of Broomlee Camp.

The Bustler was called in to coordinate 17 other tugs in a successful action to re-float her.The outcome was to try to find more of the human side of the life and times of Bustler and its crew, especially as we knew that many of its 45 crew were Campbeltown and Kintyre natives.The objective I had in mind is a shorter document that might be of considerable interest to visitors and readers of the Courier.During the months since our visit, I have gathered a wealth of material from RN service records, family photos, official books, The Campbeltown Book, newsletters and my father’s curriculum vitae.I have also found that another Bustler model is on show in the National Museum in Edinburgh.Most of my father’s papers are with family in Australia. He died there in 1981 \u0026#8211 and the family have some that should be of interest, so I am arranging  to bring them over here.One book stands out: \u0026#8216The Tattie Lads,\u0026#8217  by Ian Dear, published by Bloomsbury in 2016, available from Amazon at £22.50 hardback, also on Kindle.It tells \u0026#8216the untold story of the Rescue Tug Service in two World Wars and its battles to save cargoes, ships and lives.\u0026#8217Chapter one tells the history and background of the Rescue Tug Service (RTS).Chapter two is simply named \u0026#8216Campbeltown.\u0026#8217 Its 40 pages tell how the town became the world centre for rescue tug boats in the First World War and reopened in the next war.The chapter charts the rise of the U-Boats and the threats from aircraft, the re-establishment of the Royal Naval base from six tugs in 1939 to 85 world-wide by the end of the war.Campbeltown became the national training base and was responsible for naval discipline, including pilfering, looting and even a minor mutiny.Incidents, some amusing and others not so give a flavour of what life was like in those days, especially the anecdotes of the actual rescues that were attended round the world.The rest of the book recounts the feats and some failures of the RTS worldwide and RTS’s eventual closure at the end of the war. The only  direct  reference to my father, Lt Archie Leckie, is at pages 153/4 while stationed at an outstation of RTS at St John’s, Newfoundland.In March 1942, he had strongly reported after a tricky rescue with a tanker there that his then tug, Tenacity, should have had a modern towing winch.Shortly afterwards he was promoted to Lieutenant-Commander and appointed maintenance officer, rescue tugs base at St John”s.There is also a photo of \u0026#8216Bustler\u0026#8217 towing a conundrum used to lay the fuel pipeline Pipe Line Under The Ocean (Pluto) to Cherbourg after the Normandy landings.My father was mentioned in despatches for this action. I have donated a copy of the book to the museum and Elaine has placed it beside the model.I think there should, be a much bigger project to tell this story.My sister and I have many happy childhood memories of Bustler, and have even sailed on her but there are gaps as we were children at the time.We were shielded from the dangers my father faced and, of course, he was unable to tell us where he was going.Another of our difficulties is that having left school and Campbeltown in 1953, we also lost touch with Kintyre people.We are interested in any written experiences, or details of any surviving sailors.Donald Leckie,North Berwick.donaldleckie7@gmailHMRT Bustler in Campbeltown museum.

This year it was reprinted by Comely Bank Publishing as Russain Doll.In a strange synchronicity, at virtually the same time as last week’s talk, former SNP leader and MP Alex Salmond, who now broadcasts for Russian television, was dumped as a potential chairman by the investor trying to takeover Johnston Press.Drawing on her own seven years BBC radio experience, Ms Lloyd’s heroine, Anna, is a radio producer at the Scottish Broadcasting Corporation as it has been renamed after independence.The book’s blurb states: ‘In an independent Scotland, Russia attempts a soft occupation under the noses of the novice government.‘Against her best intentions, she finds herself falling for a Russian diplomat tasked with delivering Scotland into Moscow’s hands.‘As war looms, will this relationship save, or destroy, Anna?’Ms Lloyd, a scientist, runner and skier says she was on the river or pitch more than in a lab.This description fits Anna who is often described as ‘out for a run’ and Ms Lloyd says is: ‘Feisty, smart, sporty and spouting opinions.’‘When I wrote the book, the Brexit vote had not happened and Donald Trump was a bad television games show host,’ said Ms Lloyd. ‘It was written before the concept of fake news.‘It is more of a love story than a political novel. I remembered looking at photos from when Paris was liberated in 1945 after the German occupation and wondering what happened to the collaborators.‘It is written in a post-independence parallel world, so much has happened since 2014.‘Russia presents an amazing enigma of tremendous wealth but is their relationship with the West more about posturing?’One member of the dozen who attended the talk asked: ‘Do you think Scots would prefer Euros to Roubles?’Ms Lloyd said she glossed over the question of Europe but did imagine that Scotland would have to renegotiate its seat at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Ms Lloyd is working on a second book and said: ‘I have young children so I can indulge myself.’Russian Doll is available for £9.99 from Amazon and booksellers or direct from the author, who also sells a natty line in sports socks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter sea photos wanted","story":"Photographers across the UK have just two weeks to enter their best images of the sea in an annual photography competition run by national maritime charity, the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.The competition, which closes on Monday, August 13, encourages amateur and professional photographers to submit pictures that best encapsulate Britain’s enduring connection with the sea.It celebrates the nation’s proud maritime heritage and our reliance on seafarers.The competition’s prestigious judging panel includes experts from the Sunday Times, the I, and Amateur Photographer Magazine, alongside the charity’s chief executive, Captain Justin Osmond.The overall winner of the competition will be presented with a voucher for photographic equipment.The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society provides financial assistance to fishermen, mariners and their dependants who are suffering hardship, whether due to accident, ill health, unemployment or in retirement after a life spent working at sea.In the last year the charity received 560 new applications for assistance and distributed £1.4 million in more than 2,000 cases of need.To enter the competition go to: www.shipwreckedmariners.org.uk or  www.facebook/shipwreckedmariners and @ShipwreckedSoc.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lotto draws 4","story":"The draw for Dunaverty\u0026#8217s three number lotto was made on July 19.The winning numbers were five, seven and 17.There were no winners and the next draw for a jackpot of £200 will be held on August 12.Tickets are available from committee members, the club steward, Muneroy tearooms and the Burnside bar.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"caledonia way cycling companion guidebook","story":"A comprehensive pedaling plan to the cycle route from Campbeltown to Inverness was published last week.The 118 page handlebar bag sized spiral bound book, to guide cyclists on National Cycle Route 78, is so far available at Machrihanish Holiday Park, Patersons Bakery Carradale, Skipness Smokehouse and Argyll Backpackers at Inverneil.Independent publishers, The Offcomers \u0026#8211 Janet Moss and Pete Martin, visited Campbeltown last Thursday, from their Cumbria base, to launch the book\u0026#8217s first edition.It was the pair\u0026#8217s second visit since May when they put finishing touches to the production which started about 18 months ago.Mr Martin said: \u0026#8216The Caledonia Way covers some of Scotland\u0026#8217s best scenery with plenty of emptiness.\u0026#8216The guide has full listing sections including complete Ordnance Survey maps of each section, a comprehensive accommodation guide and locations where cycle spares might be found.\u0026#8216We have cycled the route at least once in both directions although much of the research has been during the winter months.\u0026#8216Some of the toughest bits of the route are between Campbeltown and Oban.\u0026#8217The route is split into six sections and includes fully Ordnance Survey maps detailing each day\u0026#8217s ride.Travel to Campbeltown is more complicated than to Inverness, for the bike borne tourist, but the Offcomers suggest the ferry as a good option particularly as the fare is £7.90 and the bike goes free.Apart from some slight niggles, such as the second line, describing Campbeltown as being at the southern end of the Kintyre Peninsular (sic), it is a fine guide to the route.There are ominous omissions in the accommodation listing and places to eat.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.

Eileen, 31, will return to the country where she was born as part of a team including Mercury-nominated artist, producer and collaborator Jon Hopkins and neuroscientist Mendel Kaelen, as well as photographers, architects and filmmakers.  Eileen said: \u0026ldquoAfter a 10-year solo adventure into the depths of the Legend of Tayos and my father\u0026rsquos work, it is a real honour to be joined in this quest to protect the caves by such an inspiring group of fellow explorers with a collective knowledge and talent beyond anything I could have imagined was possible.  \u0026ldquoI am excited to be part of the efforts to continue what my father and Neil Armstrong started back in the 1970s and have renewed hope in the efforts of protecting these precious, beautiful and fragile environments from devastating destruction.  The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020. It is hoped the exhibition will shine a light on a drive to make Cueva de los Tayos\u0026rsquo unique and endangered ecosystem a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

A report presented to East Lothian Licensing Board as a tool to help it set its policy placed East Lothian as 18th out of 30 local authorities for alcohol availability, but that figure rose to 13th out of 30 for number of on-sales and fell to 21st out of 30 for number of off-sales.  It also found that alcohol-related death rates were four times higher in neighbourhoods with the most outlets when compared to areas with the fewest in the county and crime rates were also two-and-a-half-times higher.

More than 620 entries were received from across the county, elsewhere in the UK and even as far afield as the USA and New Zealand.  Four flag designs\u0026nbsphave been shortlisted to go forward to a public vote.  The voting process is now open and runs until the end of this month, with final votes being accepted no later than 5pm on Friday, August 31.  The result will then be kept under wraps while the winning design is made into a flag, which will be launched around St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day.  Run jointly by East Lothian Council and the Scottish Flag Trust, in association with the Lord Lyon and the Courier, the competition was open to anyone and was free to enter.  The judging panel comprised the Lord Lieutenant of East Lothian, Michael Williams Lord Lyon Joseph Morrow East Lothian Council Provost John McMillan and chief executive Angela Leitch David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust and Courier editor Robbie Scott.  The four designs are below:  Design A    This saltire design on blue reflects the local birthplace of the\u0026nbspnational flag, with the cross in gold signifying the wealth of \u0026nbspEast Lothian\u0026rsquos farmlands and reputation as the granary of \u0026nbsp Scotland. The lion rampant is a traditional emblem of the county \u0026nbsp\u0026ndash it appears in many local coats of arms while King William the \u0026nbspLion was born in the royal palace in Haddington. The blue\u0026nbspstripes through the gold represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.  Design B    Using three horizontal bands in strong colours, this design\u0026nbsp depicts the key industries of the county \u0026ndash blue for the sea\u0026nbspand fishing, above yellow for the county\u0026rsquos beaches and\u0026nbsptourism, above green for the farming. And in the centre,\u0026nbspa fluttering saltire reflecting the birthplace of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag, within a map outline of East Lothian\u0026rsquos territory.  Design C    This design employs two distinctive curved bands of colour\u0026nbsp\u0026ndash the blue upper band representing the importance to East\u0026nbspLothian of the sea, and the lower green band representing\u0026nbspthe rolling countryside and the Lammermuirs. In the first quarter is a white saltire, one of which is like a beam of light,\u0026nbspto acknowledge the county being the birthplace of the national flag.  Design D    The centrepiece of this design is a gold lion rampant \u0026ndash a traditional emblem of East Lothian appearing on the council\u0026rsquos coat of arms and on the arms of many of the\u0026nbspcounty\u0026rsquos ancient families. It sits over a white saltire\u0026nbsprepresenting the local origins of Scotland\u0026rsquos flag. The field\u0026nbspof the flag comprises three horizontal bands \u0026ndash blue for the sea around the county\u0026rsquos coastline, yellow for its beaches, and green for its rich farmland.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoIt was a very difficult decision for the judges, having to choose four final designs from the huge number of high-quality submissions we received.  \u0026ldquoI hope that East Lothian residents will get involved again and let us know what their favourite design is.  \u0026ldquoHaving a distinctive new civic flag for East Lothian will allow individuals and groups across the county to express pride in their local community, to celebrate their heritage and help raise recognition and awareness of East Lothian nationwide.  \u0026ldquoI will be very excited to see the outcome of the public vote.  David Williamson, chairman of the Scottish Flag Trust, said: \u0026ldquoExperience elsewhere suggests that involving the public in choosing a civic flag is by far the best way to progress, and the hope is that the interest already shown in the East Lothian competition will continue into the voting stage.  \u0026ldquoVoting on the four shortlisted flag designs has been held back until after the main holiday period so that people don\u0026rsquot miss out on the chance to participate.  Lord Lyon Dr Joseph Morrow added: \u0026ldquoThere was a wealth of talent expressed in the entries which reflected very positively on the area.  \u0026ldquoI now look forward to the vote of the people and the taking of the ownership of a flag to be a symbol of pride in East Lothian.

A meeting of Cockenzie Community Forum yesterday evening (Wednesday), was told that the company had also contacted Prestonpans Community Council about its plans, with the former Cockenzie Power Station site seen as a possible home for the work.  It has also been suggested that East Fortune Airfield could be a potential home for the company\u0026rsquos site.  Skyrora describes itself as a launch vehicle development company with aims to cater for the growing demand to send small satellites into space.  It is developing rockets which it hopes to launch from a UK spaceport.  The engine testing would not involve the launching of rockets but would require fuel to be stored on-site to fire up the engines.  The UK Space Agency announced it was investing millions of pounds in a site in Sutherland as the new home of the UK\u0026rsquos first spaceport for launching rockets.  Skyrora said it was looking for an engine test site within an hour of its Edinburgh offices to give it a local base.  Presenting the proposals to the forum yesterday evening, Prestonpans community councillor Calum Miller said that the engine testing would sound no louder than a jet engine to those within 500 metres and the benefits the site could bring would outweigh the \u0026ldquominor inconvenience.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe can bring top scientists and engineers into East Lothian, there is potential for localised manufacturing and supply of goods and services, to interest local schools in engineering, science and the next space race.  He added that the community council had not taken a view on the proposals and was looking for feedback.  Earlier this year it was revealed that Glasgow produced more space satellites than any other city outside of the USA.  Robin Hague, lead engineer with Skyrora, said that the company was designing a new Scottish launch vehicle and looking at a number of locations around Edinburgh, the Lothians and Fife to ground test its engines.  He said: \u0026ldquoEast Lothian has some excellent possibilities and we look forward to seeing if we can find a home there.  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe would always be interested in finding out more about projects which have the potential to grow the local economy and support jobs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8153016.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"a-host-of-local-acts-to-perform-at-fringe-by-the-sea","story":"  An array of entertainment is on offer during the festival, which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary with a bumper 10-day programme of events.

But it showed that residents who both live and work in East Lothian earn 15 per cent less each week, taking their pay packets well below the national average.  East Lothian Council says the gap in pay reflects the nature of the county\u0026rsquos economy, with many jobs traditionally low paid such as part-time or seasonal roles.  But one community councillor said the problem was \u0026ldquolow ambition and called for East Lothian to learn to compete with Edinburgh rather than providing employees for the Scottish capital.  Calum Miller, who supports the ambitions of Prestonpans Community Council \u0026ndash of which he is a member \u0026ndash for a cruise terminal to be built at the former Cockenzie Power Station site, said: \u0026ldquoIncreasingly, East Lothian sees itself as an appendage to Edinburgh rather than an independent entity.  \u0026ldquoGraduates are almost expected to leave once qualified for a better paid job in Edinburgh or elsewhere. Workers who can\u0026rsquot move have their horizons limited to jobs in the social care sector, manual labour and/or part-time.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian needs to learn how to compete again with Edinburgh and pull employers here rather than push employees into the city.  \u0026ldquoTo do that, the infrastructure needs to take a big leap forward housing needs to be cheaper and more accessible, fibre broadband needs to enter houses and businesses directly, and East Lothian Council needs to allocate land for enterprise plus foster a hunger for new business.  The community council has produced a brochure outlining its vision for a Port of Prestonpans which it says would bring in new income and employment.  Mr Miller said it was just one of the new ideas which could benefit the county.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Port of Prestonpans would not only transform the tourist potential of East Lothian, it would bring in new local companies that we haven\u0026rsquot even imagined.  The latest report from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) found workers who lived and worked in East Lothian have gross weekly earnings of \u0026pound517 on average \u0026ndash well below the \u0026pound595 for residents working outwith the county.  The number of households in the county which are classed as \u0026ldquoeconomically active is also above the national average, with over 81 per cent of residents employed in some way.  The number of men of working age living in the county who were not employed was considered too low to count by ONS.  East Lothian Council said it was looking at ways to develop the local economy.

The charge Stokes faces states that their \u0026ldquoconduct was such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his personal safety, contrary to section 3(1) and (7) of the Public Order Act 1986.  A 27-year-old man allegedly suffered a fractured eye socket in the incident, at which fellow England cricketer Alex Hales was also present.  Wearing a blue suit and red tie, Stokes was driven to the city\u0026rsquos Crown Court in a silver people carrier and walked straight into the building flanked by the media.  A potential jury of 16 people were brought into courtroom one to be asked a series of questions about their knowledge of the defendants.  Judge Peter Blair QC, The Recorder of Bristol, asked them: \u0026ldquoLastly, I ask you this question.  \u0026ldquoIf will be for you to make a judgment. Are any of you an extremely committed cricket follower? Particularly in the sense of following a national team\u0026hellip England, India\u0026hellip particularly going on tours, following them around the place.

At the beginning of proceedings they were all asked by the clerk to confirm their names, and each replied \u0026ldquoYes.  Gordon Cole QC and Anu Mohindru are representing Stokes Stephen Mooney is representing Hale and Anna Midgley is representing Ali. The trial is expected to last between five and seven days.  Stokes missed the Ashes after being suspended from playing for England. Without him, England lost the Ashes to Australia 4-0.  He has since played in the Test series against New Zealand, Pakistan and, last week, starring as England beat India at Edgbaston.

Opposition parties said he was trying to blame others for a mess of his own making, and warned it would be a disaster for the UK to crash out of Europe without a trade and customs relationship with the continent.  Official contingency plans suggest a no deal Brexit could choke ports, create food and medicine shortages, lead to social unrest and torpedo the economy.  Downing Street said it was \u0026ldquoconfident of a good deal, but did not disown Dr Fox\u0026rsquos remarks, which chime with its effort to sell Theresa May\u0026rsquos Chequers plan for a soft Brexit in Europe.  Last week, as part of a Cabinet drive to concentrate minds across the Channel, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned the UK and EU were heading a for no deal \u0026ldquoby accident.  Mrs May also interrupted her holiday to meet France\u0026rsquos President Macron to discuss it.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos top negotiator, last week trashed key parts of the Chequers plan, saying it tried to cherry pick parts of long-standing trade and customs arrangements.  Dr Fox said Mr Barnier\u0026rsquos had dismissed the proposal, which has split the Tories, simply because \"we have never done it before\", making \u0026ldquothe chance of no deal greater.  He told the Sunday Times: \u0026ldquoI think the intransigence of the [European] Commission is pushing us towards no deal. We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen.  \u0026ldquoBut if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it\u0027s a bureaucrats\u0027 Brexit - not a people\u0027s Brexit - then there is only going to be one outcome.\"  He said that if the EU didn\u0026rsquot like the Chequers plan it was down to them to offer one \u0026ldquoacceptable to us.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos up to the EU 27 to determine whether they want the EU Commission\u0026rsquos theological purity to be maintained at the expense of their real economies.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos essential that no deal looks creible to the EU.  In July 2017, Dr Fox said EU-UK legal and regulatory alignment made a deal easy.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We don\u0026rsquot want to have no deal. It is much better that we have a deal than no deal. We can of course survive with no deal.  Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned on Friday the odds of no-deal were \u0026ldquouncomfortably high, sparking a fall in the value of the pound.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said no deal would be \u0026ldquoa catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive, and MPs had a duty to prevent it.  He blamed Mrs may\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoreckless red lines on leaving the single market, customs union and European Court of Justice, Tory divisions and \u0026ldquofantasy Brexiteer promises.  SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell tweeted about Dr Fox: \u0026ldquoIt is not astonishing (given his political track record) but it is deeply worrying that he understands so little about the EU.  SNP foreign affairs spokesperson Stephen Gethins MP said: \u0026ldquoFirst it was Jeremy Hunt, then Mark Carney, and now Liam Fox is saying we are likely facing a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo scenario when the UK leaves the EU.  \u0026ldquoThe Tory government\u0026rsquos chaotic handling of the Brexit negotiations, and its ideological red lines, have resulted in small and large businesses already having one foot out the door.  \u0026ldquoWith eight months left before the self-imposed Brexit date, the UK government must commit to remaining in the single market and customs union. There is still time for the government to take a step back and work with the business community and devolved governments to pursue an outcome that safeguards our economy, jobs and living standards.\"  Former Tory minister Priti Patel said Mrs May may should ditch the Chequers plan, which would maintain a \u0026ldquocommon rule book on goods and agri-foods.  The Brexiter MP said it did not fulfill the referendum result and would \u0026ldquoleave us half-in and half-out, still bound to EU regulations and constraints.  In a swipe at the PM, she said \u0026ldquopolitical courage, the kind of courage that appears to have been lacking over the past two years, was required to deliver a loose frade trade deal.  Ina newspaper article, former Labour Home Secretary Lord Blunkett said people who voted Leave over immigration concerns were not \u0026ldquoracist, but had been issuing a \u0026ldquocry for help about the state of the political system and the aftermath of the financial crash on their lives.

These days, it\u0026rsquos the railway that runs past the site of the former Perthshire forest that for many has come to symbolise inertia on a dramatic scale.  In 2008, the First Minister Alex Salmond promised to cut 35 minutes off the train journey between the Central belt and Inverness in four years.  Today, exactly ten years later, campaigners will highlight times have been reduced by an average of just four minutes, and two-thirds of the 118-mile Highland Main Line between Perth and Inverness remains single track.  Meanwhile, over the same decade, work has started on a \u0026pound3bn upgrade to the A9 that follows the same route.  The government quango Transport Scotland says the current aim is to deliver an average rail service lasting three hours, and a \"fastest\" of 2hrs 45 mins, by 2025.  Transform Scotland, which campaigns for sustainable transport, says the government should now make doubling and electrification of the Highland Main Line, a key connection for the far north, a top priority in its new Strategic Transport Projects Review.  The gorup\u0027s Paul Tetlaw said: \"In 2008, Alex Salmond said that within four years the rail journey time would be cut to 2 hrs 45 mins, but a decade later it averages around three and a half hours \u0026ndash yet A9 journeys are getting faster as road dualling.  \u0026ldquoThe public were told that there would be additional rail passing loops and double-tracking, but all that is being delivered is resignalling of two crossing loops.  \u0026ldquoHourly passenger trains and an average journey time saving of 10 minutes are promised but with no additional track it\u0027s highly likely we\u0027ll see more delays and cancellations as more trains are squeezed onto the single track railway.  He said the Borders Railway was a reminder single track sections meant poor performance.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government now needs to deliver serious investment in the railway to ensure there is a level playing field between road and rail.  Ian Budd, of Friends of the Far North Line, said: \u0026ldquoThe Highland Main Line is key to the whole regional rail network. Slow journey times and unreliability between Perth and Inverness have a knock-on impact on connecting trains to the Far North Line, Kyle and Elgin, and discourage people from switching from car to train.  \u0026ldquoRail travellers are entitled to see the Scottish Government deliver on its manifesto promises and make the step-change improvements which Alex Salmond announced 10 years ago.  \u0026ldquoWhat we have at the moment in no way equates with the government\u0027s stated policy.\"  David Spaven, from the Rail Freight Group, added: \u0026lsquoEveryone wants to see fewer 44-tonne trucks on the A9, but the current very limited upgrade to the Highland Main Line offers little or nothing for rail freight.  \u0026ldquoIndeed the worry is that rather than freight shifting from road to rail - the Government\u0026rsquos policy objective - we will see the loss of existing rail traffics, as the A9 gets faster and the single-track railway increasingly congested. That\u0026rsquos economic and environmental madness.  \u0026ldquoWe need longer crossing loops, so that freight trains 40 per cent longer than at present can compete much more effectively with road hauliers.  The Scottish Government said Phase 1 of the Highland Main Line improvements, increasing services from 9 to 11 per day and shaving six minutes off average trips, had been delivered.  However UK cuts meant spending was restrained.  A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoPhase 2 is well underway and aims to deliver an hourly service between Inverness and Perth (continuing to Glasgow or Edinburgh), further journey time reductions of around 10 minutes, and more efficient freight operations by Spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoOur ongoing future investment is truly transforming the rail network and giving passengers and freight users across rural and urban Scotland the best railway they\u0026rsquove ever had.  She blamed the UK Government for a shortfall in funding for 2019-2024 of \"at least \u0026pound460 million short of early industry estimates of costs to deliver the improvements required to meet forecast future demand for services. This means our future investment decisions will need to reflect the financial climate we are faced with as a consequence of decisions taken by the UK Government."},{"url":null,"title":"grandmother-61-is-britains-longest-serving-swimming-lifeguard","story":"  Now 61, it is thought that Joy Cunningham is Britain\u0026rsquos longest serving active lifeguard.  Still working 37 hours a week over five days, the mother-of-one and grandmother of two has no plans to leave the pool, saying she intends to keep working right until she retires at 65.  Mrs Cunningham, of Rotherham, Yorkshire, said her only major scare came in November 2016, when she saved the life of an off-duty police officer who collapsed and went into cardiac arrest.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe alarm went off and I thought it was someone having an epileptic fit but it was someone having a heart attack.  \u0026ldquoI had to turn him over \u0026ndash he was blue \u0026ndash and gave him CPR and the defibrillator.

After 45 years\u0026rsquo experience, you just know.  \u0026ldquoI can\u0026rsquot see many others doing it as long as I have.  I never expected to do it this long myself.  She first became interested in swimming after obtaining a life-saving certificate as part of her Duke of Edinburgh Award.  She then saw a job advert for a recreation assistant in a local newspaper and that\u0026rsquos how she got the job.  \u0026ldquoAt the interview, they said \u0026lsquocan you start on Monday?\u0026rsquo but I hadn\u0026rsquot even left school, she added. \u0026ldquoSo I went to school in the morning and started work in the afternoon.  \u0026ldquoI never really set out to be a lifeguard, I wanted to be a swimming teacher. When I saw the advert for a recreation assistant I thought at least I\u0026rsquom getting into pool work.  Mrs Cunningham, who has been married to Stephen, 62, for 41 years, must also do regular timed swims to prove her lifeguarding proficiency \u0026ndash including a 20-metre swim and a 20-metre tow in 65 seconds, followed immediately by another 20-metre swim and a 10-metre tow in 45 seconds.

As climate change is causing alpine plants to grow at higher altitudes, Dan Watson and Paul Thomson need to take extreme action to make sure they keep their botanical knowledge up to scratch.  They are part of the National Trust for Scotland\u0026rsquos intrepid countryside experts and have just received specialist training in rope access, so they can reach never-before accessed areas and get a better understanding of the plant life that\u0026rsquos found there.  Between them they scour some of the Trust\u0026rsquos most mountainous terrain at Ben Lawers, Glencoe and Mar Lodge Estate and have recently undergone rope training and abseiling in a bid to access more inaccessible areas.  Mr Thomson said: \u0026ldquoThe main target for this work is for botanical surveys of inaccessible areas. For example, we are planning to access crags and gullies in Coire nam Beitheach at Glencoe National Nature Reserve. I monitor a number of rare plants there, but I am certain that there is much to be discovered in even more remote locations.  \u0026ldquoThere are many other locations at both of these properties that we will look at in coming years, but requests are also starting to come in from elsewhere too.  The move is seen as necessary as NTS research shows Scotland\u0026rsquos rare mountain plants are disappearing at an \u0026ldquoalarming rate.  Monitoring has revealed many fragile alpine species are vanishing from areas they used to inhabit and retreating to higher altitudes in response to global warming.  Conservationists say milder, wetter winters, drier springs and a decrease in lying snow are having an impact on plants growing on peaks. Studies at some of the country\u0026rsquos famous beauty spots have revealed major declines.  In some cases, plants have vanished from lower level locations where they had previously thrived. The tiny but fragile Arctic plants, such as Iceland purslane, snow pearlwort and Highland saxifrage, are found only in a handful of locations in the Highlands and islands, clustered in north-facing gullies, coires and crevices, frequently protected by the last pockets of late-lying winter snow.  The move into extreme monitoring comes after a large group of botanists, geologists and mountaineers spent time on ropes surveying unexplored areas of the exposed and often sheer north face of Ben Nevis in a search for similar species.  The survey on the 1,346m mountain led to the discovery of Alpine saxifrage in new locations. The plant had not been detected on Ben Nevis until a survey in 2014.  They also found new populations of Highland saxifrage, as well as the white-flowered Arctic mouse-ear, a plant native to Greenland, Iceland and Norway, and starwort mouse-ear, plus a mystery grass.  But a survey on the Burg peninsula of Mull had found the tiny annual plant was being severely hit by warmer springs, which had also led to increased growth by other plants competing for space.  On Bidean nam Bian next to Glencoe in Argyll, the latest field surveys also found a 50 per cent decline in Highland saxifrage at lower altitudes compared to the numbers detected in 1995.  Mr Watson added: \u0026ldquoOur monitoring shows climate change is affecting Scotland\u0026rsquos mountains at an alarming rate. When you see mountain plants either retreating up the hill or disappearing from their niches, it\u0026rsquos clear evidence that things are changing. The evidence is unequivocal to me that the climate is changing in the mountains."},{"url":null,"title":"geography-no-longer-just-about-books-and-maps-says-michael-palin","story":"  The veteran traveller said the \u0026ldquomagic appeal of the subject lies in exploring your surroundings and being able to \u0026ldquosee and touch and feel what the land is like.  In an interview with the Press Association, Palin said geography is a vital subject in the modern world, \u0026ldquobroadening minds and encouraging an understanding of different countries and cultures.  \u0026ldquoThe world is much more accessible, and I think it is hugely important that we understand the world and why countries are where they are, why live they how they do, what the climate is, what they produce, he said.  \u0026ldquoGeography is no longer just something which you learn from a book and a map and that\u0026rsquos it. It\u0026rsquos very much now a collaborative thing.  \u0026ldquoThe world is out there, you can go and see for yourself, very often now for very small amounts of money, what the world looks like, and I think that\u0026rsquos a great opportunity.  \u0026ldquoI think it broadens the mind \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos one obvious thing, but it also, I think it just helps us to understand how other countries are the way they are, and this is really very important in just helping us to realise that we all share the same planet and we should know more about what makes us different as well as what makes us similar.  Palin\u0026rsquos comments come as Press Association analysis shows that A-level and GCSE geography entries have risen in recent years.  In England alone, GCSE geography entries rose by more than a third (36%) between 2012 and 2017.  The increase is likely to have been fuelled by the introduction of the English Baccalaureate \u0026ndash a government measure which recognises teenagers who study English, maths, science, history or geography and a language at GCSE.  At A-level, the analysis shows that geography entries in England have risen by a fifth (21%) over the same five years.  Palin said field trips are \u0026ldquovery important, adding that this is what first got him interested in the subject.  \u0026ldquoI looked at books, I looked at maps, I looked at atlases, I enjoyed that, but the thing that inspired me most of all was being taken from the school into the local area to look at nature, to look at the way the land looked, to understand the geography, to walk up little hills and streams and see how the ecological system worked, look at the environment.  He added that he believes getting outdoors is \u0026ldquowhere the magic appeal of geography lies, it\u0026rsquos being out there, it\u0026rsquos being able to see and touch and feel what the land is like.  The writer, broadcaster and Monty Python star suggested that the reason for the rise in the popularity of the subject may be partly down to modern technology which allows people to talk to others \u0026ldquoin Argentina, or Sri Lanka, or Norway all in the same morning.  \u0026ldquoI think that helps, that stimulates the curiosity, which is a very important part of learning about the rest of the world.  He added: \u0026ldquoI think people are travelling more, and younger travellers, I think, are demanding something which I think is quite admirable, which is to go to more difficult places and very often to places where they can help in the local communities, which I think is a really important thing, because that\u0026rsquos the human side of geography which is very important."},{"url":null,"title":"which-airline-has-the-worst-punctuality-record","story":"  The Hungarian carrier\u0026rsquos UK departures were an average of 23 minutes late in 2017, according to Press Association analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.  Norwegian Air Shuttle has the second worst performance, followed by Vueling Airlines, Thomas Cook Airlines and BMI Regional.  The ranking features the 44 airlines with at least 2,000 scheduled flights from UK airports last year.  Average delay figures take into account every flight that operated, including those that were on time. Cancelled services are excluded from the CAA data.  Scandinavian Airlines is the most punctual, with aircraft typically taking off just seven minutes behind schedule.  Aer Lingus has the second best record, followed by Air France, Alitalia and Delta Airlines.  The average delay across all flights was 15 minutes.  A spokeswoman for Wizz Air said: \u0026ldquoA number of issues specific to the UK, including airport infrastructure, airspace congestion and slot restrictions contribute to a significantly worse on-time performance of our UK routes compared to the rest of our network.  She noted that disruption was caused by \u0026ldquoparticularly severe winter weather last year and added that the airline is taking measures to improve its punctuality, such as basing eight aircraft in the UK to reduce its exposure to inbound delays.  Norwegian Air Shuttle\u0026rsquos UK flights mainly consist of short-haul services from London Gatwick, Manchester and Edinburgh. Its average delay of 22 minutes does not take into account the majority of Norwegian\u0026rsquos long-haul flights from UK airports, which are operated by a British subsidiary.  A Norwegian spokesman said frequent air traffic control (ATC) strikes across Europe and adverse weather \u0026ldquoinvariably impact punctuality and are beyond the control of airlines.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe do everything possible to ensure that flights operate to allow passengers to reach their destination as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoNorwegian is committed to keep improving punctuality, and where factors are within our direct control we have introduced new measures to continue delivering a smooth, efficient experience for our passengers.  The CAA said punctuality \u0026ldquoclearly matters to airline passengers and it publishes the performance of carriers to allow people to \u0026ldquomake informed choices about which airline to fly with.  Dale Keller, chief executive of airline association BAR UK, said delays are \u0026ldquoextremely costly to carriers.  Passengers on delayed flights from UK airports are entitled to assistance and compensation depending on the cause and length of the disruption.  When flights are delayed for more than two hours, airlines have to provide free access to phone calls or emails, meals and refreshments, as well as hotel accommodation if an overnight stay is required.  Passengers can also claim compensation when flights are delayed by more than three hours unless there are \u0026ldquoextraordinary circumstances such as severe weather or a security alert.  Payouts range from 250 euro (\u0026pound223) to 600 euro (\u0026pound535) depending on the length of the flight and how long it was delayed.  Editor of magazine Which? Travel, Rory Boland, advised delayed passengers to \u0026ldquomake sure you make a claim for the compensation that you are entitled to.

Acting Director of Nursing Caroline Hiscox said: “We are delighted that we’ve been able to put together such a comprehensive, advanced level course. “This work has been developed over the past 18 months by two of our Nurse Consultants in Advanced Practice in collaboration with RGU. “Their support and enthusiasm has been invaluable. “Being able to offer a formal paid trainee programme for Advanced Nurse Practitioners demonstrates the value that NHS Grampian places on training and developing its workforce.”                                                                                                        The course is expected to commence in November.

The bench, which would have been used by many a passenger at the old station before its closure in 1964, was recently discovered at auction and has now been secured for the project by Aberdeenshire Council and regional transport partnership Nestrans.                                                    It is hoped that following its refurbishment the bench will form part of the new station, providing a tangible link to the station’s history which was a strong theme from earlier consultation with the community.                                                    The project team are also keen to involve local organisations in the restoration work, with support already provided by haulage firm ARR Craib who assisted with transport of the bench.        The news comes soon after plans for the wider Kintore Rail Station project took a significant step forward with planning permission now granted for the platform, car park and access road. Councillor Peter Argyle, who is chair of Nestrans, deputy leader of Aberdeenshire Council and chair of their Infrastructure Services Committee, said: “I am very pleased to see the progress that has been made on the development of the station. “The discovery of the bench is most opportune and a fantastic way to involve the community and recognise their desire to see local history reflected in the new development. I look forward to seeing the bench renovated and on site at the new station.”Councillor Martin Ford, who is a member of the Garioch Area Committee and a substitute member for the Nestrans board, had highlighted the historical find at auction and added: “I am delighted that the bench has been secured and will form a point of historical interest at the new station.                                                                                                         “The area where the new station is sited has deep historical roots in transportation, going back prior to the 1800s, and you can see various signs and markers of its time as a Turnpike Road and a canal route. Whilst we do not know the exact age of the bench, it seems fitting that we can continue this tradition and link the new station back to the former site, which opened in the 1850s.” The station project is jointly funded by Aberdeenshire Council, Nestrans, and Transport Scotland via the Scottish Stations Fund, with support from Network Rail and ScotRail. It will see the construction of new station platforms, lifts/overbridge, passenger waiting shelters, a new access road, a 160 space car park, a pedestrian and cycle path and secure cycle parking facilities. The new station, which accompanies Network Rail’s Aberdeen to Inverness Improvement Project, is due to re-open to passenger services in late 2019.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Monday 6 Aug 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116893.jpg","title":"Decision on Premier Inn to be made in September","story":"A DECISION on a budget hotel chain\u0026rsquos bid to build a three-storey complex on vacant land in Thurso is expected to be made next month.The proposal for a Premier Inn was originally criticised by Caithness Chamber of Commerce, but an avalanche of comments online appears to suggest a majority of people in the area would be behind the move.A Highland Council spokeswoman said the application will come up for consideration in September.\u0026ldquoBut there is a lot of outstanding information our planners are awaiting from the agent, she added.The application is to be decided by the council, but notice is taken of objections submitted to the planning authority \u0026ndash both in document form and online.According to the Highland Council\u0026rsquos website, just two documents objecting to the building of the hotel had been submitted to planning by the end of last week and one organisation was backing it.One of the objections is from the chamber of commerce, which claimed that the hotel would have \u0026ldquoa significant negative impact on other businesses and the town centre. Another is from Sandra Gow, of Lybster, who stated that the plan would be detrimental to the \u0026ldquoexisting, privately owned hotels, B\u0026ampBs and self-caterers in the surrounding areas with the potential of closure to many small businesses during the winter months.The chamber, however, has since sought to clarify its stance, stating in a post on the planning department\u0026rsquos website that the original objection was \u0026ldquomade specifically on behalf of our members in the hospitality industry.Of the documented cases submitted to planning, the Caithness Disabled Access Panel has written in support of the hotel plan.It says it accepts the development could impact on other hotels, but adds: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only hotel in the county with completely disabled bedrooms and showers and adhering to the laws on discrimination.The organisation says it has had \u0026ldquonumerous complaints from visitors in the county on the lack of disabled rooms in the area.Since the chamber\u0026rsquos objection was first reported on July 13, social media users have voiced their feelings.Those posting online generally have fallen onto two sides \u0026ndash those in support of local hoteliers, and an opposition accusing them of self-interest.\u0026ldquoWe need more beds.

But we are aware that this could cause difficulties for some community groups and we are asking for views on the sort of events where we should consider waiving a kitchen charge. An example of this might be an event to raise funds for the local community.”The council has said the budget simulator exercise they carried out in 2016 demonstrated a willingness among the public for an increase in charges for services if this helped reduce the need for cuts to frontline services.Initial discussions on the possibility of charging for the use of community school kitchens have been held with the chairs of many of Orkney’s community associations, who will be contacted again and asked for further feedback — including suggestions for the types of events that should be excluded from a kitchen hire charge.Other groups and individuals can also provide views and ideas by sending an email to education.leisure@orkney.gov.uk  or writing to Community Learning and Development, Council Offices, School Place, Kirkwall, Orkney KW15 1NY.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ONWP is keen that people come along to find out more, and specifically what will be happening in Orkney.The events are open to the public, and it’s hoped that Orkney’s landowners will attend. Additional events will be held on the islands that Macca and Angela will be working on.The ONWP, which is a partnership between Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and RSPB Scotland, aims to protect Orkney’s native wildlife by removing stoats, an invasive non-native predator that was first recorded in Orkney in 2010.Since 2010, stoats have spread and established across Mainland Orkney, Burray and South Ronaldsay.There have also been a handful of sightings reported on other islands including Hoy and, most recently, Shapinsay. Traps and motion-activated cameras have been used to try to determine whether stoats are present on these other islands following possible sightings. However, the presence or absence of stoats on all “high-risk” islands must be determined before the eradication programme to remove stoats can commence.Stoats are notoriously difficult to detect particularly when they are at low densities. Therefore, the only way to be certain that stoats are not present is to use specially-trained dogs to systematically search for signs and scent of stoats.Plans are in place to train six dogs as part of the main project, but, as they take years of training, Macca has been brought in from New Zealand to help confirm the presence or absence of stoats on islands that are at high-risk from stoat invasion due to their proximity to Mainland Orkney.High-risk islands are those that are within a swimmable distance of islands where stoats are established. Stoats can swim considerable distances (at least 3 km) over open water.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

track","story":"\u0026nbspMULTI-million pound efforts to improve water supplies in Ross-shire have been welcomed by a local MP.Jamie Stone visited a Scottish Water site near Evanton this week to view progress on a \u0026pound5.5 million project to improve security of the water supply for customers across much of Easter Ross and beyond.Work at the site has been underway since February this year and is expected to be complete in early 2019.A new tank is being built with a capacity to store up to eight million litres of drinking water, improving security of supply for around 30,000 customers across Easter Ross, Dingwall and the Black Isle.The work is being carried out by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD, in partnership with contractor Coffey Construction.After seeing the work in progress and receiving an update on Scottish Water\u0026rsquos current work across his Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, Mr Stone said: \"The long period of dry weather this summer is a reminder that, even in the Highlands, water is a precious resource that we all rely on in countless ways.\"The work currently taking place will help to improve the security of water supply for Easter Ross in the event of any future issues at the water treatment works or disruption to the local water network.\u0026nbsp\"At the same time, it is good to hear of the work Scottish Water\u0026rsquos operational teams are currently carrying out across the north to maintain supplies and protect the local environment.\"Despite some recent rainfall, it is still important that we use water wisely to help lochs and reservoirs recover so that supplies can be maintained through the rest of the summer and beyond,\" he added.ESD project manager Kevin Williamson said the works remained on track for completion next year.He said: \"The work we are delivering reflects a significant investment for one of the key water supply areas in the Highlands, which serves communities right around the Cromarty Firth.\"Work on site is going well and we anticipate it will be complete early next year.\u0026nbsp\"Once in place, the new storage tank will give Scottish Water improved ability to carry out important maintenance work at the water treatment works, and deal with any short term issues affecting the local water network, without impact on customers\u0026rsquo water supply.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMeanwhile, Scottish Water has urged customers to do what they can to conserve water amidst this year\u0026rsquos very dry summer.Its strategic customer service planning team Leader for the north, Jim Briggs, said: \"Separately from this longer term investment, we are continuing work in consultation with Sepa to manage water resources across the north following the prolonged period of dry weather.\"Despite some rainfall in many areas over the past week, our frontline teams are continuing to work hard to ensure we can maintain supplies to all of our customers.\"We continue to need customers to help us by using water wisely, for example by using a watering can instead of a hose in the garden and only using dishwashers and washing machines when fully loaded.\u0026nbsp\"The support of thousands of customers with these small and simple steps can make a big difference to maintaining water supplies for everyone and allowing water resources to recover when rainfall occurs.\"He added that the Evanton project will help to provide \"clear, fresh-tasting drinking water to our customers in a wide range of circumstances\".Monday 6 Aug 2018 12:37

I spoke to Cockburns and they came forward and agreed that we could have the kit fitted.\"Cockburns was the first business that we approached because we were looking for somewhere in the West End.\"The timing was just great because literally the day after they agreed to do it a nationwide campaign was launched for butchers to do the same thing \u0026ndash so Cockburns have spearheaded things.\"He added: \"This equipment is so valuable.\"Somebody that collapses outside of hospital has a six per cent chance of survival but when you have one of these kits available it can go up to around 70 per cent.\"The bank\u0026rsquos generous donation is also expected to pay for kits to be fitted in Inverness, Thurso and Kirkwall.Lucky2BeHere has a strong network of volunteer defibrillator trainers across the Highlands and Islands.It has fundraised for around 200 units so far and Dingwall now has one at the primary school, outside Castle Street Church of Scotland and Highland Council\u0026rsquos Ross House building in High Street.There are other kits in various places around Ross-shire including Contin Village Stores.And another unit is due to be fitted outside Alness Pharmacy within the next month.A nationwide campaign called \"Butchers at the Heart of the Community\" is now encouraging butchers to display collection tins in their shop in an effort to raise money for a local defibrillator.More than 30 Scottish butchers have signed up to the scheme so far, with hopes that further shops will follow suit in the future.Monday 6 Aug 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The disastrous roll-out of universal credit that was piloted in the Highlands has resulted in vast swathes of unnecessary suffering.\"Folk, many of whom are working, are being driven into destitution and families are being left with no choice but to rely on foodbanks.\u0026nbsp\"These are political choices and it\u0026rsquos high time those in power in Westminster took responsibility for the unnecessary suffering they are causing to folk in the Highlands, and indeed across the UK.\"Ms Todd and fellow SNP MSP Kate Forbes have now opened up their office for use as a food drop-off point in a bid to encourage more Ross-shire residents to donate as organisations struggle to keep up with demand.The kind-hearted pair said constituents will be able to leave food parcels, containing non-perishable items including pasta, rice and coffee, at their office in Dingwall High Street.And they have teamed up with Blythswood Care, which runs the Highland foodbank network, in response to the news that the number of children using the Dingwall site has risen by more than 50 per cent. The facility has also been appealing for extra donations to meet demand.\"When we saw the recent plea for food bank donations, we thought this was something we could do to help,\" Ms Forbes said. \"For the first six months of the year, 40 children have received food parcels from the Dingwall food bank, which is more than a 50 per cent increase on the previous year.

Local business figures have warned that caution should be taken when analysing the figures.David Richardson, Highlands and Islands development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses, believes the area\u0026rsquos vast size and sparse population must be taken into account.\"Before discussing the Highlands position in the rather grisly league table one must first ask whether deaths per 10,000 people is a fair measurement,\" he said.\"The Highlands\u0026rsquo enormous size, tiny and highly dispersed population, and relatively poor public transport provision means that people here are more dependent on cars than in many other parts of the UK.\"If comparisons are being made then deaths per mile of road should perhaps be given too.\"Moreover, for much of the year the local population is massively boosted by visitors. I understand that visitors are included in the road death figures but not in the population figures, and presumably this significantly skews the results.\u0026nbsp\"Whatever the case, all deaths and injuries on roads are tragedies and it is of the utmost importance that our road network is fit for purpose for all: locals, business users, and visitors alike.\"FSB has called for increased investment for many years now, and while Highland Council\u0026rsquos recent announcement that it is allocating an additional \u0026pound1.5 million to road upgrades is extremely welcome, one has to ask if it is enough.\"Monday 6 Aug 2018 12:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Some said the test had prompted otherwise confident five-year-olds to burst into tears and one child had “soiled itself due to the extreme distress”.             Children said things like “I’m no good”, “I can’t do this”, and “Why are you making me do this?” Others were “shaking and crying.” One teacher branded the tests ‘completely useless’ and ‘cruel nonsense,’ saying pupils could get high scores simply by guessing answers.            But the reaction has been strangely hostile. Commentators, experts and some parents have ­dismissed the evidence, insisting that teachers and pushy parents are transmitting their own uncertainties to the kids and traumatised children will quickly recover. Why so harsh?Some SNP supporters treat problems uncovered by political rivals like Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie as manufactured criticism of the Scottish Government. But there’s more.Scots have long experienced and endured hurt at an early age and although smacking’s been banned, a belief still remains that early, tough life lessons “never did us any harm”. This sits beside a deep-seated cultural belief that the three Rs should be hammered into children as ­early as humanly possible.Such withering disbelief flies in the face of the facts. Britain stands alone in ­forcing five year-olds into formal education at all. In 1870, the UK parliament chose an early school starting age so ­mothers could ­provide cheap labour in ­factories. Only 12 per cent of countries worldwide share British practice and they are all are former parts of the British Empire.Malta and Ireland, however, recently joined 66 per cent of the world’s ­countries, which start school at six. Meanwhile 22 per cent of countries including Finland, Estonia and Switzerland have a play-based kindergarten from 3-7. Perhaps that’s why they topped a recent OECD ­international review into education achievement.             According to child psychologist Dr David Whitbread of Cambridge University: “Play is an adaptation which evolved in early human social groups. It enabled humans to become powerful learners and problem-solvers. “Neuroscientific studies have shown that playful activity leads to synaptic growth, particularly in the frontal ­cortex, the part of the brain responsible for all the uniquely human higher mental functions.” In short, if you stifle play you stunt personal growth.Scotland has long talked the language of play, but remained firmly wedded to what’s ae been, with disappointing results. In 2016 Durham and York university academics found Scottish pupils from the most deprived areas were 14 months behind more affluent peers entering primary school. No amount of national testing will change that, but a move away from early “schoolification” just might. Evidence suggests that children taught literacy skills from the age of five do no ­better in the long run than those who start at seven. On the other hand, an early start at school is linked to social, emotional and mental health problems in children forced to begin formal learning before they are ready. This is why the national standardised test at five does such ­damage.Some innovative Scottish teachers have introduced a play-based approach to Primaries 1 and 2. Children’s confidence is slowly built up and a close, trusting relationship develops with the teacher. Then one day the children are handed a tablet and told to do things they have never done, for reasons they can’t understand.             The children can’t step back, as they can in the rest of their play-based lives but must sit for 40 minutes until the task is completed – no matter how they feel. Some are fine. But some are conscious of what they cannot do for the first time, trust with the teacher is broken and confidence collapses. The P1 test forces a clash between two government-backed systems – non-confrontational play and formal, rule-based education. For what?The result may not be traumatic for the majority of children but it isn’t productive either. “Baseline” tests on English five year-olds were introduced twice in the noughties and abandoned because they had “no meaningful value at such an early developmental stage”. Now Theresa May plans to introduce Scottish-style, baseline tests again, prompting the British Educational Research Association to label them “a baseline without basis”. That verdict applies to Scotland too.This is not to say all forms of testing are bad. In world-leading Finland, there is constant observational assessment by teachers who undertake individual, informal tests if there’s a problem. But they are not standardised, not national and not made before the age of six or seven because Finnish five-year-olds are still in kindergarten enjoying play-based learning. In Australia, testing has been conducted for a decade with youngsters of seven and eight – not with five-year-olds.             Professor Sue Palmer, founder of Upstart Scotland, says “after ­primary four there are evidence-based arguments both ways about the value of testing. In primary one there are none at all. National standardised testing runs totally counter to the Curriculum for Excellence and nips in the bud the growing move towards play in the early years. It encourages teaching to the test, ­narrows the curriculum and changes the relationship between teachers and children – particularly damaging for disadvantaged children.” The urge to stuff education into five-year-old brains may be understandable but it’s not rational, helpful or kind. Willie Rennie wants to abolish P1 tests. He concludes: “If [this policy] continues it will be because ministers are more interested in saving face than giving children the best start to their schooling.”It’ll be hard for the Scottish Government to admit its mistake – but harder still if progressive parents and teachers conclude that Willie Rennie is right."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4779067.1533481712!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotland s weather summer could stretch into october","story":"        Summer could last into October this year in Scotland with longer spells of \u0026#8220dry and fine\u0026#8221 weather making it a record breaker, according to the MET office.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"we are underdogs in milne cup clash says shetland manager main ","story":"Shetland football team\u0026#8217s coaches Kevin Main (on left) and Robert Geddes at a training session at the Gilbertson Park last Wednesday.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"37 bruce crescent lerwick ze1 0pb ","story":"Offers over £167,000\n\n Externally: Off-road parking, a large front, side and back garden and an outside bin store.\nThe property is in move into condition.

The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nMonday 6 Aug 2018 12:38 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116804.jpg","title":"Beauty spot gets the all clear from SEPA","story":"Gavin Musgrove\n\u0026nbsp\nBadenoch and Strathspey\u0027s most popular bathing spot has been given the all-clear from blue-green algae which can make humans very ill and potentially be fatal to dogs.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Team attended at Loch Morlich at Glenmore on Tuesday following reports of an outbreak at the beauty spot which is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people every year.\nSigns had been erected at key locations around the loch warning visitors of the potential presence of the algae.\nIt is understood that a concerned local vet raised the possibility of the algae being present after a dog took ill showing symptoms of having been in contact with blue algae following a visit to the beauty spot.\nA SEPA spokeswoman said: \"A member of our team went to Loch Morlich on Tuesday to take a sample of the algae and none could be found.

Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

a great way to save money.\nA spokeswoman for Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council this week refuted the claims, saying: There have been no instances lately of bins not being collected other than due to local access issues and these are always followed up the next day.\u0026#160 \nStaff in the Waste team have flexible job roles and are employed where needed across cleansing, waste and recycling centres.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06.jpg","title":"65378  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship has taken place.\nEleven international teams are making Antrim their home for this week\u0027s event. \nTwo hundred young people from USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain,\u0026#160 Republic of Ireland,\u0026#160 France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nSpectators will have a great view from the Lough Shore of the 11 picturesque gigs as they race on Lough Neagh.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05.jpg","title":"65379  ","story":"    \nTHE 2018 MCE Insurance Ulster Grand Prix is less than a month away and anticipation is certainly building. \nFollowing a TT that saw Peter Hickman demolish the outright lap record to win a thrilling Senior TT finale ahead of Dean Harrison, the 7.4011 miles of Dundrod tarmac is the next meeting ground for these road-racing heavyweights. \nPeter, UGP Man of the Meeting in 2017 and now the world\u0027s fastest rider, secured podium finishes in four classes, three of which were as race winner.\nUlster Grand Prix Bike Week runs from August 5-11 and is gearing up to be the perfect climax to the international road-racing season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a03.jpg","title":"65381  ","story":"    \nA SECTARIAN killer has appeared at Antrim Magistrate\u0027s Court charged with escaping lawful custody.\nStanding handcuffed in the dock, 32-year-old Christopher Kerr spoke only to confirm that he understood the four charges against him.\nIn addition to an offence of escaping lawful custody, Kerr is also accused of three drugs offences.\nThe alleged offences arose after he allegedly ran away from prison officers in Victoria Square shopping centre while out on day release.\nKerr, who is currently serving a life term for the shocking and horrifying sectarian attack which claimed the life of 15-year-old Catholic schoolboy Michael McIlveen, was arrested at Antrim Area Hospital the following day. \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f2.jpg","title":"65382  ","story":"    \nA CRUMLIN family has again been hit by tragedy after the sudden death of a teenager, just weeks after his father passed away.\nHenry Turley (14)\u0026#160 fell from a hotel balcony in the beach resort of Playa de Muro on Majorca in the early hours of last Wednesday (July 18).\nSpanish Civil Guard said his mother Claire was holding on to his hand and attempting to save him after he overbalanced on the second floor balcony before he fell at around midnight.\nHenry\u0027s death comes less than seven weeks after his father Stephen, who ran the Ten Storey tattoo parlour in Crumlin, was discovered dead at a friend\u0027s house.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f-jpg.jpg","title":"65469  ","story":"    \nWITH last weekend\u0027s downpour bringing Antrim to a standstill, it was no surprise that rain also stopped played at Muckamore Cricket Club!\nAfter weeks of fine weather, normal service was finally resumed with one of the most dramatic downpours in living memory.\nMuckamore Firsts were taking on North Down at the time, but the players soon beat a hasty retreat to the clubhouse when the skies opened.

open to sign for six weeks, until 19 September.\n\nThere will also be evening signings – something required by the legislation governing recall petitions – on September 6 and 13, when the petition can be signed up until 9pm.\n\nNorthern Ireland’s Chief Electoral Officer, Virginia McVea – who is responsible for the process – had discretion under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 to designate up to 10 locations within the constituency for the petition to be signed.\n\nMeanwhile, the DUP has clarified that Ian Paisley has not left the party after some confusion yesterday in the wake of Parliament redesignating the North Antrim MP as an independent.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe party confirmed that Mr Paisley remained suspended, rather than having been expelled, and as part of that the party had withdrawn the whip from him.\n\nThat puts him in the same category as MPs such as Ivan Lewis, who is suspended by Labour and is listed as an independent.\n\nThe recall process was automatically triggered when Mr Paisley was given a suspension of 30 sitting days – the longest on record since at least 1949 – over “serious misconduct” relating to taking free luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then lobbying on behalf of the regime without declaring that they had given the valuable gifts to himself and his family.\n\nThe DUP veteran apologised for not declaring the holidays but insisted to Parliament’s standards commissioner that his letter asking the prime minister to change UK policy at the UN to that favoured by Sri Lanka did not amount to lobbying for the regime.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe petition to remove Mr Paisley will have to be signed by 7,547 people – 10% of the eligible North Antrim electorate – if there is to be a by-election.\n\nUnlike the situation with an election, any voter – not just those who can provide a legitimate reason for not being able to vote in person – will be able to apply to sign the petition by post.\n\nThat rule, about which DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has expressed concern, is in place because, unlike an election, it will be known that anyone going into the signing place will be there to sign the petition, reducing the typical anonymity around an election.\n\nParties wanting to campaign for people to sign the petition will have to register if they are planning to spend more than £500.\n\n

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Loughbrickland Branch looks forward to proudly representing Loughbrickland area at the event.”\n\nAs local champions of Remembrance, the Loughbrickland Branch of The Royal British Legion is looking to work in partnership with their community to bring their unique Remembrance message to the Menin Gate, on their wreath, where it will be displayed in a wreath installation for viewing by the general public until the end of August. Two schools Scarva Primary and Bronte Primary have written messages that will be attached to the wreath\n\nThe parade will start at midday and we encourage the public to make the trip across to Ypres for the August 8 and fill the Market Square to watch the parade, One Hundred Days ceremony and then enjoy an afternoon of musical entertainment including The Central Band of the Royal British Legion.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIf you want to find out more about GP90 or your local Royal British Legion branch, then visit www. britishlegion.org.uk/branches/loughbrickland or contact Loughbrickland.Secretary@rblmunity\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8529070.1533295653!/image/image.jpg","title":"remains of joint was found in the driver s seat of vehicle","story":"\nWhen police noticed the smell of cannabis coming from a car they found the remains of a joint in the driver\u0026#8217s seat, Craigavon Magistrates Court heard last Wednesday.\n\n                \nJustin Henderson McGowan, whose address was given as Clare Road, Tandragee, admitted unlawful possession of cannabis and herbal cannabis on May 13 this year.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe court heard that at 8.45pm a police mobile patrol in Meadow Lane, Portadown, noticed a strong smell of cannabis coming from the defendant’s vehicle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe remains of a joint were found on the driver’s seat and he accepted he had a grinder with a small amount of cannabis in it.

Through their images the artists strive to provide a shared unique view of our ever changing world. The connections to be found in the paintings have their origins in the subsequent years of collaboration and friendship and in the mutual understanding of contemporary art which has been formed.\n\nOn opening night a painting by Tommy was presented by the collective to the permanent collection of the Gallery. It is hoped this will provide a lasting reminder of the event and be enjoyed by visitors for many years to come. It adds to an already impressive body of Tommy’s work held in significant international collections. \n\nTommy was quick to thank all those involved, in particular curator Marijana Ramov and organiser Jasna Barisic. The whole celebration was planned with an eye to detail and on opening night the gallery was absolutely stunning. Music by Croatian duo Lucija Grabovac and Tony Vlasic provided a melodic soundtrack and complimented the occasion perfectly.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTommy believes that exhibiting internationally and presenting our artistic culture is important and it is a challenge which he relishes. We are all becoming more connected, something which we can all enjoy. Croatia is fast becoming a popular holiday destination, something which he finds completely unsurprising. Dalmatia is an area of outstanding natural beauty.\n\nHe considers the combination of clear blue seas, historic villages and natural cuisine a compelling mix. It is a region which he enjoys and which he hopes to visit again.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kerri ann in limbo as she faces long wait","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA YOUNG\n Newtownabbey woman who suffers from suspected multiple sclerosis (MS) has said that “nothing in her future is certain” as she faces a possible two-year wait for treatment.\n\n24-year-old Kerri Ann Flanagan had suffered from bouts of paralysis and pain for around five years before optic neurosis claimed the sight in one of her eyes in April.\n\nAfter years of misdiagnosis, Kerri Ann was eventually referred to a neurologist and an MRI scan showed a number of symptoms linked to MS.\n\nThe MRI uncovered 10 lesions on Kerri Ann’s brain and instances of demyelination – where the cover on the nerve cells on the brain is worn away, leaving them exposed to further damage.\n\nDespite the severity of her condition, Kerri Ann could be faced with a two-year wait for treatment, and she said she’s  “absolutely terrified”.\n\n“That worry and that fear has caused me so much extra stress and anxiety,” she said. \n\n“The waiting lists are adding pressure to people who are already dealing with so much. I just feel like nothing in my future is certain any more. I had so many ideas of things I wanted to do, I was planning on getting married to my fiancé, and now I just feel like my life is on hold. I’ve been suffering from the symptoms for about five years. It has gotten worse in the last two years, especially with the pain.\n\n“When I went to A\u0026#038E with the paralysis they told me it was a migraine and sent me home.\n\n“It was awful because I knew that it wasn’t the case – I knew there was more to it. You know your own body. It was really frustrating and I felt that because of my age I was constantly being dismissed. \n\n“They were saying things like ‘Somebody your age wouldn’t have’ whatever, but there are plenty of young people who suffer from things like MS. It’s really important that they start to realise that. It was frustrating to be treated that way.”\n\nAs well as suffering some of the most debilitating symptoms linked to MS, Kerri Ann told how her condition impacts on her mental health.\n\n“It’s hard,” she said. \n\n“Since I took really ill in May and lost my sight it’s gone really downhill from there. So many symptoms keep flaring up. There are days I can’t get out of bed. It’s very unpredictable. I don’t even want to leave the house because things can change so fast. I could be fine one minute then in and hour I could lost the ability the to walk, I could fall, or my speech could be slurred. It makes me very self-conscious as well. I have had people ask if I’m drunk or on something else. I shouldn’t be embarrassed, but it’s so difficult to explain. It has just made my life so hard. My mental health has suffered terribly, not just because of the MS, but because of the pressure of the wait on an appointment. There are lots of people with different health problems, serious health problems that are in a similar situation. It’s not acceptable.”\n\nKerri Ann’s mum, Kim Flanagan, said that underfunding of the NHS was exacerbating her daughter’s condition. \n\n“In 2016 there was an MS specialist in the Royal [Victoria Hospital] who has come out on a number of occasions and said that his patients were waiting 16 months to be seen, that it was unacceptable and that it was endangering they’re health,” she said. \n\n“He said that it was down to cuts in budget. Kerri Ann will wait 12 months to see a neurologist, and then it could be a further six months or more for and MS clinic. That’s almost two years before you get a treatment plan. She has been paralysed in both legs and one arm. She has had trouble swallowing, chewing and talking, feeling like she’s on a boat or that she’s drunk. They are all symptoms of MS. She ticks so many of the boxes. We’re talking one to two years by the time a treatment plan is in place, during which time that demyelination in the brain will continue to wear away at the covers on her nerve cells – it’s more irreparable damage. Why can’t the government get back together and do something? Northern Ireland has one of the highest rates of MS in the UK, especially amongst women, and the Assembly aren’t even sitting. They are failing the people. We don’t want this publicity, but it has to be done.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said: “The patient is waiting for an urgent appointment at the MS Clinic where there is currently a five month waiting time. She will see a Consultant Neurologist specialising in Multiple Sclerosis at this clinic. The patient will not have to wait 12 months to see a Neurologist before that appointment.” \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"photographer thomas is the pride of belfast media group","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nAN intimate\n retrospective of photographs chronicling 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement is set to come under the spotlight at St Mary’s University College as part of Féile an Phobail’s 30th celebrations.\nDuring his 20-plus years as a photo journalist with the North Belfast News, Thomas McMullan has captured seminal photographs depicting the darkest days of the conflict, the “early mornings and even longer days of the peace process talks” and “the lighter moments during that period”.\nHaving always had an interest in “striking images” Thomas explained how it wasn’t until his early 20s that he picked up a camera hoping to “make a living out of it”.\n“I first started off with a wee magazine in Ardoyne called Horizon, it was a community magazine and it was there that I decided I want to make a career out of taking photographs. I really loved it and I would’ve tried to take photos out of anything newsworthy,” he said.\nThomas spoke of how he approached Andersonstown News founder Basil McLaughlin and Belfast Media Group managing director Máirtín Ó Muilleoir at their West Belfast offices, who after going through his portfolio “gave me a start and that was 20 years ago.”\n“At the North Belfast News we were capturing the moment of the peace process, it was a very fraught, fragile time,” he said.\n“We were talking to prominent republicans, loyalists, peacemakers at that time. I wanted the photos to reflect on why we were going through a peace process, why we were going through a struggle for peace.”\nThomas spoke of how trying to condense 20 years worth of work down to “15, 20 photo’s” was a tough ask. “It was extremely hard to whittle down the photos, you have to be critical of your own work but I got there,” he laughed.\nThe multiple recipient of NI Provincial Press Photographer of the Year says it will be a fantastic opportunity to see his work up alongside his fellow artists when the St Mary’s Visual Arts exhibition goes live on Thursday evening.\n“This is a piece of history for me coinciding with 30 years of Féile. I’m really looking forward to seeing all the other work. I was always a member of the Christian Brother’s camera club on the Antrim Road and owe them a lot.\n“I hope those who are coming will appreciate the work.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37184302.ece/7cf68/AUTOCROP/w140square/Belfast_Pride-006.jpg","title":"belfast pride parade","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Grammar schools dominated the top of the league tables for GCSE results achieved in 2017, taking the top 54 places.\n\n\n\n\nRevealed: Budgets for every Northern Ireland school 2018-19\n\n\n\n\nThe Belfast \u0027s league tables include data on every secondary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe top non-grammar school at GCSE in 2016/17 was St Patrick\u0027s High School, Keady (91.3%), followed by St Colm\u0027s High School in Draperstown (87.7%), and St Patrick\u0027s College, Maghera (85.9%) - just ahead of the top performing controlled non-grammar, Castlederg High School (83.3%).Overall across Northern Ireland in 2016/17, some 70.3% of year 12 pupils achieved five or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (or equivalent) including English and maths.\n\nThis was up 2.4 percentage points from 2015/16.\n\nPeter Dobbin, principal of Assumption Grammar, described its joint topping of the latest league tables as a surprise 85th birthday present for the Co Down school.\n\n\"I am delighted with the phenomenal achievement of our Assumption girls at both GCSE level and A2 level,\" he said.\n\n\"The girls and the staff of Assumption have worked so hard and fully deserve this public recognition of our academic success.\n\n\"However, it is the school\u0027s \u0027Fully Alive\u0027 ethos which underpins every aspect of why Assumption Grammar is such a unique educational establishment and has been since we were first established by the Missionary Sisters of the Assumption 85 years ago this year.\n\n\"This is a surprise birthday present which will bring a smile to all our Assumption girls, past and present.\"\n\nDown High principal Maud Perry said the school was very proud of its results and she paid tribute to the hard work of pupils.\n\n\"We celebrate the many talents and achievements of all our pupils at Down High and we\u0027re very proud of the 100% pass rate at GCSE in both mathematics and English,\" she said.\n\n\"Our motto \u0027nothing is achieved without effort\u0027 reflects our belief that there is no limit to what can be accomplished through hard work.\n\n\"This hard work of staff and pupils, alongside the support of our parents, produced these fantastic results in the 2017 summer exam season.\"\n\nToday\u0027s tables also represent a triumph for south Belfast grammar school Wellington College, which scored 94.7%, significantly above the Northern Ireland average, as it works to be removed from formal intervention.\n\nPrincipal David Castles said: \"We are very proud of the excellent GCSE outcomes our students have attained. This significant improvement is part of our drive at Wellington College to raise standards, engage students and build pathways to success.\n\n\"Excellence in exams is a result of students, staff and parents working together, and these GCSE results give a great foundation for success at A-level and beyond.\"\n\nHow we did sums for the latest league tables\n\nThe Belfast  is the only source of comprehensive league tables showing the results of every post-primary school in Northern Ireland.\n\nWe obtained the data from the Department of Education for A-level and GCSE examinations sat in the 2016/17 academic year and compiled the figures into easy-to-read league tables, ordered from top to bottom. In the GCSE league tables, the Belfast  has used the percentage of pupils in the final year of a level 3 course who achieved five or more GCSEs - including English and Maths -between an A* to C grade in each school as the standard measure.\n\nThe Department of Education does not produce A-level or GCSE league tables and said it does not endorse them.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed transfer test grade intake for northern ireland schools","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

In the 2016/17 academic year 11,570 applications were made for the 8,743 available places at our 63 selective grammars.\n\n\n\n\nNI Transfer Tests: 2017 Grammar Schools’ intake and grade information\n\n\nThis is out of a total of 21,763 pupils who obtained Year 8 places at Northern Ireland\u0027s 199 post-primary schools in September 2017.\n\nToday the Belfast  can reveal what grades or scores it took to get into each of our selective grammars last year.\n\nThis exclusive data was obtained over several months by sending Freedom of Information Act requests to each of the selective grammars.\n\nCurrently there are no official figures provided by the Department of Education, because both the Post Primary Transfer Consortium\u0027s GL assessment and the Association of Quality Education\u0027s (AQE) Common Entrance Assessment are unofficial tests.\n\nOur data for tests sat in the 2016/17 academic year reveal:\n\n\nFive schools which use the AQE system did not accept a score below 100 in September 2017.\n\nFive schools which use the GL system did not accept a grade below an A in September 2017.\n\n30 schools accepted AQE scores, while 26 accepted GL scores, and seven took either.\n\nLagan College, which is partially selective, was the most popular first choice by far, with 456 applications for 200 places.\n\nFriends School Lisburn was one of the toughest schools to get into last September - the lowest score it accepted was 106 (AQE).\n\nThree of the 63 selective grammar schools were not oversubscribed.\n\nThe AQE and GL tests received a total number of 14,491 entries in the 2016/17 academic year - 7,725 sat the AQEs and 6,766 sat the GL tests. An unknown number of pupils sat both tests.\n\nThere are 199 post-primary schools in Northern Ireland, of which 63 are grammars that use academic selection for all or some of their Year 8 intake.\n\n\nLeaders in the AQE and GL organisations told the Belfast  that their entry rates have been steadily increasing over the last decade following the abolition of the old Department of Education-administered 11-plus by former Education Minister Caitriona Ruane in 2008.\n\nAQE chief executive Stephen Connolly said the number of entrants to the test is continuing to rise, with 8,169 pupils registered for the 2017 AQE tests, a rise of almost 6% on 2016 (7,725).\n\nMr Connolly said he can only speculate on the increase, but said he believed it may partly follow a decision by former Education Minister Peter Weir to allow primary schools to prepare pupils to sit transfer tests. That reversed a ruling by his predecessor John O\u0027Dowd, which saw schools receive warning letters from the department over preparing pupils for tests within school hours.\n\n\"That reflects a number of things, that is the steadily increasing primary school age population, also a backwash from the former minister taking the shackles off primary schools and allowing them to openly prepare pupils for transfer tests, and also word of mouth from parent to parent,\" he said. There was also an increase in the number of pupils who sat the PPTC\u0027s GL test, from 6,766 in the 2016/17 academic year to 7,150 in 2017/18.\n\nCarol McCann from the PPTC said parents remained very supportive of the tests.\n\n\"More than 30 schools use the GL test and it is used by a variety of types of school, including grammar and bilateral,\" she said.\n\n\"A number of PPTC schools also register pupils for the AQE test. Regarding the increase in the number of pupils sitting the test in 2017 for entry to post-primary in 2018, it is most likely as a result of a rising primary school population in a number of areas.\n\n\"It is very evident that the transfer test continues to be supported by parents in Northern Ireland who believe in educational choice.\"\n\nMeanwhile, talks between the two transfer test providers to create a single system of assessment remain \"ongoing and positive\".\n\nThe AQE and PPTC aim to have a common test in place by November 2019. Mr Connolly said that talks are continuing but the end goal is very complex, and they want to ensure any new single system is robust, will have the confidence of parents, and is of an international standard.\n\n\"The two negotiating teams made a very good decision at the outset to keep it confidential to not raise expectation or increase pressures and making sure the goodwill between us in this difficult process is maintained,\" he said. \"Trying to put together a single system is very difficult.\n\n\"I think it is very important that both groups think it is a matter of principle there should be one system.\n\n\"That principle has been agreed, but getting there is tricky simply because of the complexity of the two systems. People need to have confidence in schools, but also in the testing system.\n\n\"It needs to be reliable, robust and meet international standards. It isn\u0027t just a race to cobble together any old compromise, we are engaging in careful negotiation.\" Results for both tests are due to be released to pupils this Saturday.\n\nHow the figures are compiled\n\nUnder the Freedom of Information Act (FoI) legislation we asked the grammar schools in Northern Ireland which use academic selection to determine their Year 8 intake to provide the breakdown of the AQE/GL grades/scores achieved by the pupils they admitted in September 2017.\n\nThe data gives schools’ name, location, the highest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted and the lowest grade/score/quintile/band it accepted.\n\nOther information included is the number of first preference choices it received and total applications (which includes first, second, third choices etc).\n\nSeveral schools have provided bands for the lowest and highest scores they accepted, as this is the method they used to select pupils. Some schools accept both AQE and GL scores.\n\nNot all schools use academic selection to determine their entire intake. Wallace High School in Lisburn admits around 90% of its Year 8 intake on test results Campbell College in Belfast admits 70%, while Lagan College in Belfast and Slemish College in Ballymena select 35% of their pupils using test scores. Some other schools also use additional criteria to separate students with the same score vying for the final places. Two voluntary grammar schools, Loreto College in Coleraine and St Patrick’s Grammar in Armagh, no longer use academic selection.\n\nTotal pupil figures do not tally for a number of reasons, which can include pupils with a statement of special educational needs not being included in enrolment figures, and some pupils being accepted through special circumstances or on appeal.\n\nIn some schools pupils were admitted without using academic selection and some schools were undersubscribed.\n\nWhen comparing schools, the size should be taken into account. For example Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor has an annual Year 8 intake of 157 pupils. Its principal Mr W E Thompson pointed out that the 157th pupil they accepted in September 2017 scored 85 in the AQE test, but in the North Down area there are smaller selective grammars which accepted only 100 pupils.\n\nHe has asked us to point out that the 100th pupil Glenlola accepted scored 98 in the AQE tests.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"75m rooftop running track plan for old belfast","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There will also be shops and food and drink options on the site, which has been renamed \u0027The Sixth\u0027 in a reference to Belfast\u0027s  evening edition, \"the sixth late Tele\".\n\nWork is due to begin by the end of the year if the plans get the go-ahead.\n\nStephen Surphlis of Bel Tel LLP said: \"Offices and workspace are evolving and UK and international companies are looking to Belfast and the wealth of talent we have on tap from our universities and within our professional, creative and technology sectors.\n\n\"These firms are placing a premium on employee satisfaction and are seeking working environments that facilitate team interaction, innovation and creativity. \n\n\"Our plans for The Sixth emphasise quality, heritage-led design that makes a contribution to both user wellbeing, and the fabric of our city.\"\n\nArchitecture firm Allford Hall Monaghan Morris (AHMM), winner of the 2015 RIBA Stirling Prize for its work on Burntwood School in London, has been enlisted to work on the scheme.\n\nPaul Monaghan, founding director of AHMM, said: \"The Sixth is a bold project, focused on the experience of its users and mindful of the site\u0027s landmark status and importance as part of Belfast\u0027s built heritage. We have taken cues from the surrounding buildings and the city\u0027s lost Victorian arcades, and will restore features removed or lost from the original listed building.\n\n\"For example, we\u0027re planning to reinstate the building\u0027s main access onto Royal Avenue and reintroduce dormer windows removed from the original roofline.\n\n\"New features such as the roof-top running track, roof-top terraces and break-out spaces complement the building\u0027s focus on the user.\n\n\"A new public atrium space serves as walkway through the building, which alongside a range of ground floor retail and food and beverage offers will enliven the street level space around Royal Avenue and Donegall Street.\n\n\"The Sixth will contribute to the rapid regeneration of the area and with its close proximity to Ulster University, it will be at the centre of an emerging creative district serving the education, culture, media and technology sectors.\"\n\nCouncillor Aileen Graham, deputy chair of Belfast City Council\u0027s City growth and regeneration committee, said: \"The partnership is pleased to have submitted its full planning application for The Sixth. \n\n\"We\u0027ve made a commitment in the Belfast Agenda to growing our city\u0027s economy and positioning the city to compete internationally. Quality, innovative workspaces like The Sixth will attract the high-value jobs necessary to grow our economy and help our people reach their full potential. \n\n\"Not only will The Sixth boost the city centre\u0027s vibrancy as part of an emerging creative district, it\u0027s going to breathe new life into one of Belfast\u0027s most loved and iconic buildings.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"asbos to tackle nuisance behaviour ineffective","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They aim to tackle underlying causes of the offender’s anti-social behaviour.\n\nPublic Space Protection Orders place restrictions on those using the space, such as surrounding the consumption of alcohol.\n\nA Closure Power is “fast and flexible” and designed to allow the police or council to quickly close premises being used to cause disorder or nuisance, the consultation document said.\n\nIn Scotland, any person who plays any musical instrument, sings or performs, or operates any radio or television, or other sound producing device so as to give another person reasonable cause for annoyance and fails to stop on being asked to do so by police will be guilty of an offence.\n\nNiacro said early intervention provided a solid foundation for tackling anti-social behaviour in the long term.\n\nIt added: “Whilst there is a need for faster, short-term solutions, it would be remiss to suggest that this would be the solution to existing issues arising from anti-social behaviour.”\n\nA DoJ spokesman said it was currently considering responses to its public consultation, which closed on July 24, on potential legislation that may help prevent and tackle anti-social behaviour in Northern Ireland.\n\n“A number of views were received and these will help inform how legislation linked to anti-social behaviour is developed in the future,” said the spokesman.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37188107.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Landing%20%202_Lewis.jpg","title":"belfast airport emergency declared on flybe flight plane lands with one engine","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

However, in a second clip, taken outside the airport, Novo is seen approaching the man and asking him why he “disrespected” him, saying he had done nothing to deserve the abuse and that he “was not scared of him”.\n\nLast night the Celtic fan said he wanted to apologise unreservedly to Novo for his “indefensible behaviour”. He said: “I had been over to watch football and had returned on the same day and I was the worse for drink. That is not an excuse but it is true. I’ve let myself down.\n\n“Since the incident went viral, I’ve had an insight into the effects of abusive behaviour. Threats have been made online and I can appreciate how upsetting the original incident was.”      \n\nNovo, posting on social media later that evening, said: “Arrived at Belfast International Airport tonight to support the local community for all sides of the divide.\n\n“As soon as I walked out of the airport I was surrounded by Celtic supporters that hurled abuse and tried to attack myself.

One of the best parades I\u0027ve been to. Very positive.\"\n\nMr Beattie also paid tribute to party colleague Jeff Dudgeon, whose determined campaigning was crucial in forcing the liberalisation of Northern Ireland\u0027s anti-gay laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper/PA Wire\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he said he looked forward to the day when the party would itself take part in the Pride event. \n\n\"We\u0027ve been slow,\" but we\u0027ve changed,\" he added.\n\nOrganisers said they had noticed a rise in corporate bodies wanting to associate themselves with the festival.\n\nMr Nesbitt said Belfast Pride had become more self-assured than ever.\n\n\"It was a very positive day with a huge number of people taking part,\" the former UUP leader said. \"I haven\u0027t witnessed a Pride event for a long time and I sensed a huge change in the atmosphere.\n\n\"A long time ago it was a lot less confident, with organisers and participants feeling they had to be a lot more in your face.\n\n\"Saturday was just a celebration and I felt everyone taking part were beyond having to prove themselves.\"\n\nHe added: \"The other big difference I noticed was the number of private companies and public bodies throwing their support behind it all.\"\n\nThe first Belfast Pride parade held in 1991 attracted a small crowd of just around 100.\n\nTaking part for the second year in a row were officers in uniform from both the PSNI and An Garda Siochana.\n\nMembers of the NI Ambulance Service also took part in the celebrations.\n\nA Marks \u0026 Spencer employee in Bangor called Steven was congratulated on social media by his employers after proposing to his partner Sam at the event, surrounded by his colleagues.\n\nAs Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK and Ireland not to legalise same-sex marriage, many campaigners still view Pride as a protest.\n\nThe Love Equality campaign has called on the Prime Minister Theresa May to change the law. Patrick Corrigan, NI director of Amnesty International, said: \"Pride is always the most colourful day of the year in Belfast. This year it is bigger and brighter than ever.\n\n\"People on the streets of Belfast today are sick of a second-class citizenship based on who they are and where they live.\n\n\"Theresa May and (Secretary of State) Karen Bradley should be ashamed that 18 months after the collapse of devolution, same-sex couples in Northern Ireland are still waiting to be treated as equals. This is now in their hands.\"\n\nAround 50 Christian anti-Pride campaigners staged a protest outside Belfast City Hall. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"time drawing near for ireland border poll sinn feins mcdonald tells hunger strike event","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The march in Castlewellan was attended by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald.It marks the anniversary of the deaths of 10 republican hunger strikers, including Bobby Sands and Raymond McCreesh in 1981.In previous years tens of thousands of republicans have attended the event, which changes location annually.Relatives of IRA victims have accused Sinn Fein of \"insulting\" their loved ones memories, saying the commemoration compounds their grief.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latter, she continued, had a responsibility to take a lead on the process.\n\n\"Political leaders must begin practical preparations for a new, inclusive Ireland beyond partition,\" she added.\n\n\"We are entering a defining period in Irish political history.\n\n\"Change is coming and it must be managed, sensitively and imaginatively.\n\n\"A process of national reconciliation must be central to any genuine effort to unite the people of this island.\"\n\nAddressing the ongoing Brexit fallout, Ms McDonald said Remainers within the unionist community would be increasingly attracted to being part of a \"new and outward-looking Ireland\" as the UK continues to \"turn away from Europe\".\n\nShe also reiterated Sinn Fein\u0027s commitment to forging a united Ireland that would accommodate unionists and their culture.\n\n\"British identity can and must be accommodated in a united Ireland and I believe nationalist Ireland is open to constitutional and political safeguards to ensure this,\" insisted the party leader.\n\n\"The right of unionists to celebrate their history and tradition, to recount their experiences and suffering, and to remember and honour their dead must be, and will be, respected.\"\n\nAnd to claps and cheers, she added: \"Just as our right to remember, to commemorate and honour our dead will be respected.\"\n\nMs McDonald also stressed that the party would continue to build on its equality agenda in the event of Irish unity as she laid out Sinn Fein\u0027s vision.\n\n\"It will be an Ireland united and at peace with itself. It will be a successful, prosperous Ireland of opportunity for all, regardless of class, colour, religion, gender or sexual orientation,\" she told the crowd.\n\nReasserting her party\u0027s commitment to seeing the Executive and Assembly restored, Ms McDonald said the political stalemate could only be overcome if progress is made on a number of social issues, such as the extension of same-sex marriage legislation to the North, which the DUP is strongly against.\n\n\"Marriage equality, the right to inquests and language rights are for everyone,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Fifty years on from the civil rights movement, sections of political unionism still resist equality and rights, but they will not succeed.\n\n\"It is not sufficient for the two Governments to only call a talks process. They must bring something to the table. They need to make clear that agreements must be implemented in full.\"\n\nMs McDonald added that the DUP\u0027s \u0027confidence and supply\u0027 agreement with the Tories continued to be a sticking point in getting the Assembly\u0027s institutions restored.\n\n\"We are dealing with a British Government that is dependent on DUP votes and sees Ireland as collateral damage in their desire to remain in office,\" she added. \"That is why we need a strong Irish Government leading on these issues.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"15m euro boost for irish olympic preparations after","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

There was applause from mourners as she arrived for the funeral of Martin McGuinness last year.\n\nIn a memorable image from the funeral, Mrs Foster and Sinn Fein\u0027s Michelle O\u0027Neill were photographed reaching out to shake hands among a sea of mourners.\n\nIt is not known if Mrs Foster will attend the papal Mass as no one from the DUP was available for comment yesterday.\n\nMeanwhile, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he will express his concerns to the Pope about the Catholic Church\u0027s involvement with sexual and physical abuse during his visit.\n\nThe Taoiseach also said he intended to tell Pope Francis that Ireland accepts gay parents. As part of his visit, the pontiff will go to the Capuchin Day Centre for the homeless in Dublin and Knock Shrine. However, it is not yet clear whether he will meet victims of clerical abuse.\n\nMr Varadkar said that while his meeting with the Pope at Dublin Castle could be short, he will express his concerns about issues such as the Catholic Church\u0027s involvement in Magdalene Laundries.\n\n\"I\u0027m really glad the Pope is visiting Ireland, the visit is very welcome,\" Mr Varadkar said.\n\n\"I will certainly want to express to him the real concerns that Irish people have on the legacy of the past, in relation to issues such as the Church\u0027s involvement in Magdalene Laundries, in mother and baby homes, and sexual and physical abuse, and relay that to him.\n\n\"And also our views in society and the government\u0027s view that families come in all sorts of different forms, and that includes families led by same-sex parents, and one-parent families as well.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"irish hockey team praised after loss in world cup final","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Dewa Wijaya, West Nusa Tenggara Marine Police via AP)\n\n\n\n\nA subsequent tsunami warning sparked panicked scenes and tourists flocked to beaches in a bid to be rescued.\n\nYoung families and couples on their honeymoon were among those stuck on the islands.\n\nAlso affected were celebrities including Take That singer Gary Barlow and model Chrissy Teigen.\n\nBarlow wrote on Twitter that he had been involved in seven earthquakes, but “none have felt more deep and raw” as Sunday’s in Bali.\n\n\nThis morning I bumped into so many British families leaving Bali. How lucky we are to have that choice. I’ve had the misfortune of being in 7 earthquakes but none have felt more deep and raw as last nights. Followed by numerous after shocks.

quake would be followed by a tsunami.\n\nMr Kelsall, from Woodford Green in London, said: “There were lots of injuries and pain on the island from buildings that had collapsed on to people.\n\n“All the locals were frantically running and screaming, putting on life jackets.\n\n“We followed them up to higher ground, which was a steep, uneven climb to the top of a hill in darkness.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTourist James Kelsall said Gili Trawangan had been devastated by the quake (James Kelsall/PA)\n\n\n\n\nHe added: “It was literally the most terrifying thing I have experienced and the uncertainty of the tsunami, I had pictures of Thailand in my head from when it happened there.”\n\nSwathes of Thailand were destroyed in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.\n\nPower had still not been restored to the island by Monday morning, Mr Kelsall said.\n\nTourists flocking to the coast in search of rescue were confronted by mayhem.\n\nFootage from Monday morning showed crowds scrambling aboard a boat in a frenzied bid to escape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChaotic scenes were reported at the beaches as a rescue effort was mounted (James Kelsall/PA)\n\n\n\n\nAsh Flay, whose sister Katy was stuck on Gili Trawangan with her partner Stef, said the rescue effort had been a “disgrace” and authorities were demanding money from tourists.\n\nHe said: “I received a phone call from Katy whilst the earthquake was happening, she was distressed – crying and screaming.\n\n“All I could hear was crashes, she then called again and said a tsunami warning is out and she’s climbed a tree, doesn’t know what’s happening and then she was uncontactable for two hours.\n\n“Katy climbed up one of the trees and then somebody kicked her out of it so she had to climb another one, and injured her foot when she was running to high ground during the tsunami warning.\n\n“It was the worst two hours of my life.”\n\nIn a message to her brother, Ms Flay, from Leeds, said: “Boats (are) leaving half empty as you need a ticket… no boats for everyone just selected people.\n\n“People are punching and hitting each other.”\n\nOthers stuck on the island included a family of four from Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe group included two children, aged five and seven, according to a relative, who asked to keep their identities anonymous.\n\n\nBritish nationals affected by the \n#Lombok\n

and very scared – frankly they just want to come home,” he said.\n\nThe Foreign Office advised tourists to “monitor local media, exercise caution and follow the advice of local authorities”.\n\nSunday’s earthquake came after Lombok was rocked by a series of similar quakes on July 29.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"potential jurors in ben stokes affray trial asked if they are

Are any of you an extremely committed cricket follower?

couple of screens. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(EA Sports)\n\n\n\n\nNow, Fifa is giving players the power to introduce unique rules to these matches – including next goal wins and headers and volleys only, long-range goals counting double and a new Survival mode where each time a team scores they lose a player. \n\nAs part of the new House Rules, players can now also create a “best of” series of either three of five matches to decide a winner, as well as removing all game rules including offside and fouls. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(EA Sports)\n\n\n\n\nThe new Kick Off mode will also enables players to play one-off matches as though they were finals, complete with post-match trophy ceremony – should players want to add a bit of pomp and ceremony to their games. \n\nDeveloper EA Sports said it wanted to give players more options and ways to play after seeing gamers getting creative on social media using the mode – with hand-drawn league tables and tournament wall charts for groups of friends. \n\nBuilding on the idea of longer running competitions among friends, the game is also introducing stat tracking to Kick Off mode for the first time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(EA Sports)\n\n\n\n\nPlayers will now be able to see their complete record in Kick Off matches – wins, losses and draws – as well as win percentage, types of goals scored and where from, average possession and pass completion rate across their matches. \n\nThe feature will also support cloud saving, meaning that players can access their stats on any console – for example, when they go to a friend’s house to play – by logging in with their new Kick Off Name. \n\nEA Sports said it wanted to give single players as broad a scope of gaming choices as their prominent multiplayer mode. \n\n\nFifa 19 is out on September 28 for PlayStation, Xbox, PC and Nintendo Switch.\n \n"},{"url":null,"title":"this guys name was spelled out by the leeds v stoke scoreboard and its superb","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC
