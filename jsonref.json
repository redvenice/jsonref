As many as 700,000 end up littering the streets across Britain every day.By contrast, recycling rates of more than nine in ten are achieved in other European countries with full deposit return schemes, such as Norway and Germany.Scotland\u0027s Environment Secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, said: \u0027There is a global climate emergency and people across Scotland have been calling, rightly, for more ambition to tackle it and safeguard our planet for future generations.          Campaigners called on the Environment Secretary Michael Gove (pictured in Westminster on Tuesday) as well as the authorities in Wales and Northern Ireland, to follow suit\u0027I am therefore delighted to confirm that I intend to implement a system covering PET - the most common form of plastic packaging - aluminium and steel cans, and glass, with a deposit refund set at 20p.\u0027Our plans for Scotland\u0027s Deposit Return Scheme are gathering pace with widespread consensus demonstrating that a well-run, appropriately-targeted scheme could improve the environment, change attitudes to recycling and litter, and support a more circular economy.\u0027 Significantly, the Scottish government has rejected lobbying from the plastics and retail industry to limit its DRS regime to small, \u0027on the go\u0027, plastic bottles and cans.         Pubs, hotels, cafes and fast food chains which sell drinks by the bottle or can will have to pay the 20p deposit and it will be up to them whether they pass it on to the public.The Chief Operating Officer of Zero Waste Scotland, Jill Farrell, described the DRS plan as a \u0027game changer\u0027.\u0027By giving people an extra incentive to do something good for our environment...we are confident it will be easier for all of us to do the right thing. This will improve the volume and quality of recycling and help tackle litter in the process,\u0027 she said.The news is a vindication of the Daily Mail\u0027s efforts to highlight the dangers of plastic waste dating back more than ten years, including the Take Back Your Bottles and Turn the Tide on Plastic campaigns.The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said the Westminster government, which is consulting on introducing DRS in England, should use the Scottish plan as a template and, potentially, go even further.Its litter programme director, Samantha Harding, said: \u0027By introducing a deposit return system for glass, plastic and metal drinks containers it has taken a significant step in tackling the problem of packaging pollution - one that has resulted in devastating consequences for our countryside and environment for far too long.\u0027 Oceans expert for Greenpeace, Willie Mackenzie, said: \u0027This is a practical solution to stop material like plastic being thrown away and ending up in our rivers and oceans.\u0027Crucially Scotland\u0027s scheme will be far-reaching and include glass bottles, which is what the public supports and will drastically boost recycling collection rates. The government in Westminster must now follow suit without delay.\u0027 The decision by the Scottish government to include glass in the scheme is controversial because it will drive up the costs. However, campaigners were worried that drinks firms might try to escape the new 20p fee by switching to using glass.The decision means that the cost of dealing with all the drinks containers is passed to manufacturers and retailers, rather than being carried by local authorities and the public through council tax bills.Polling by the Marine Conservation Society shows that 72 per cent of people think the DRS should cover all sizes of drinks container and 60 per cent believe it should include plastic, glass bottles and aluminium cans.Its chief executive, Sandy Luk, said: \u0027Michael Gove must listen to what consumers want.\u0027The rest of the UK must follow the Scottish Government\u0027s lead to ensure we have the best systems in place across the UK. \u0027We need to have compatible schemes so that there is no confusion among consumers and so that we can increase recycling and help reduce the tide of glass and plastic bottles and cans blighting our shores and seas.\u0027 The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: \u0027A successful DRS, working within a wider comprehensive strategy to reduce waste could herald an opportunity to drive further increases in recycling and reduce litter, over and above the existing kerbside system.\u0027 However, the organisation as well as the Wine \u0026amp Spirits Trade Association argued against including glass in the scheme on the basis it would increase costs and create a health and safety risk. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/06/19/13163490-0-image-m-5_1557168328414.jpg","title":"Britain goes week without burning coal electricity","story":"Share this article Sean Kemp, a spokesman for the National Grid, told The Daily Telegraph: \u0027We broke the record this weekend for the longest period of time without coal.

He appeared to be in denial, telling people that he wasn\u0027t shaking so he couldn\u0027t have Parkinson\u0027s.His attitude changed as the condition took over his body and he began to think that God gave the disease to him for a reason.Ali said: \u0027The Quran says that you have to be humble to enter the gates of heaven.

This will improve the volume and quality of recycling and help tackle litter in the process,\u0027 she said.The news is a vindication of the Daily Mail\u0027s efforts to highlight the dangers of plastic waste dating back more than ten years, including the Take Back Your Bottles and Turn the Tide on Plastic campaigns.The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said the Westminster government, which is consulting on introducing DRS in England, should use the Scottish plan as a template and, potentially, go even further.Its litter programme director, Samantha Harding, said: \u0027By introducing a deposit return system for glass, plastic and metal drinks containers it has taken a significant step in tackling the problem of packaging pollution - one that has resulted in devastating consequences for our countryside and environment for far too long.\u0027 Oceans expert for Greenpeace, Willie Mackenzie, said: \u0027This is a practical solution to stop material like plastic being thrown away and ending up in our rivers and oceans.\u0027Crucially Scotland\u0027s scheme will be far-reaching and include glass bottles, which is what the public supports and will drastically boost recycling collection rates. The government in Westminster must now follow suit without delay.\u0027 The decision by the Scottish government to include glass in the scheme is controversial because it will drive up the costs. However, campaigners were worried that drinks firms might try to escape the new 20p fee by switching to using glass.The decision means that the cost of dealing with all the drinks containers is passed to manufacturers and retailers, rather than being carried by local authorities and the public through council tax bills.Polling by the Marine Conservation Society shows that 72 per cent of people think the DRS should cover all sizes of drinks container and 60 per cent believe it should include plastic, glass bottles and aluminium cans.Its chief executive, Sandy Luk, said: \u0027Michael Gove must listen to what consumers want.\u0027The rest of the UK must follow the Scottish Government\u0027s lead to ensure we have the best systems in place across the UK. \u0027We need to have compatible schemes so that there is no confusion among consumers and so that we can increase recycling and help reduce the tide of glass and plastic bottles and cans blighting our shores and seas.\u0027 The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: \u0027A successful DRS, working within a wider comprehensive strategy to reduce waste could herald an opportunity to drive further increases in recycling and reduce litter, over and above the existing kerbside system.\u0027 However, the organisation as well as the Wine \u0026amp Spirits Trade Association argued against including glass in the scheme on the basis it would increase costs and create a health and safety risk. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/06/19/13163490-0-image-m-5_1557168328414.jpg","title":"Britain goes week without burning coal electricity","story":"Share this article Sean Kemp, a spokesman for the National Grid, told The Daily Telegraph: \u0027We broke the record this weekend for the longest period of time without coal.

Photograph: iStockTrinity College Dublin’s graduation ceremonies are steeped in cherished tradition: the Latin ceremony, the front square procession and the strict black or white dress code.But one particular tradition is attracting criticism and, for some, turning graduating into a day of “dread” or even “ humiliation”.In Trinity College Dublin, graduands - those about to graduate - are lined up and paraded in descending order of academic achievement.Students with the highest grades - such as a 1.1 - parade first, followed by 2.1., 2.2s and, lastly, those with pass gradesOther colleges call out names alphabetically, with everyone treated with equal jubilation and privacy.For reasons of tradition, however, graduands at Trinity are groups into academic bands of achievement.A number of students and graduates who spoke to The  feel the result can end up as a\u0026nbspkind of public shaming that can feel “horrendous” or “totally unncessary.”“It’s always in the back of your mind”, says one post-graduate student, who adds another layer to what is already a stressful final year.Another former student with a pass grade remembers the ceremony as “humiliating”, while another describes it as “totally unnecessary”.With final year already a stressful time, and with mental health becoming more of a focal point in education, is it time to change Trinity graduation ceremony?‘Degrading’“I would support any move Trinity makes to end this degrading tradition,” says Lynn Ruane, an independent senator and former president of Trinity College’s student union.“In Trinity it is the goal of many to get that 1st class honours and fair play to them, but it wasn’t for me... I just wanted to get through my degree, develop academically and do the best I could with the situation I was in.”While she says she loved her time at the university, she ended up fighting through many difficult situations.“I lost my Da, I was a single Ma, I had very little second level schooling and I was trying to find my way through a whole new world. Is my 2.2 degree less than anyone else’s? No, I don’t think it is,” says Ruane.“I was just as capable, intelligent and hard working as the students I shared a class with. Yet I had to fight what I felt was an embarrassing tradition of being one of the last people to be called during the graduation ceremony, as though my achievements were lesser than the person beside me with a 2:1.”“I got average results, but I was a good student, studying like many others in exceptional circumstances.“I would support any moves Trinity made to end this degrading tradition,” she says.Eoin O’Donnell, writing in the latest edition of Trinity News, says it is common for some to skip the ceremony because they don’t want to be presented in a “condescending and diminishing manner”.“On a day that’s supposed to be a celebration of the collective accomplishment of an entire class, Trinity’s graduation ceremony turns that joy and satisfaction into something more akin to a public shaming for some,” he writes.TraditionA spokesperson for Trinity College Dublin said its graduation ceremony was a positive experience which is enjoyed by many graduands based on feedback received.“The ceremony has not changed its format significantly over time it maintains its traditional format for the presentation of candidates as prescribed in the Statutes of the University,” the spokesperson says.“We have never received negative feedback but we would consider reviewing and proposing revisions if we felt it had negative effects on our graduands and graduates and especially in relation to their mental health.”“Trinity is committed to promoting equality and inclusivity among our student body and the mental health of our students is of utmost importance to us,” they added.Trinity’s students’ union president Shane De Rís says the union has not received a mandate or been requested to push for such reform, but always remain open to such calls.“The Trinity graduation ceremony is one steeped in tradition but that does not mean that it cannot be changed,” he says.“Excelling academically in a chosen field of study is a feat which must be recognised, achieving a first class degree requires an incredible amount of work and determination.“This does not mean, however, that someone who gets a third class degree should be subject to humiliation or singled out.”De Rís suggests a compromise where students who finish top of their group be recognised without segregating other graduants.“Everyone who is awarded a degree, regardless of the class, has earned something to be proud of, and the graduation ceremony is how that is done,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3886221.1557391605!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"finally summer on the cards as temperatures set to soar next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople enjoying the sunshine in  Sandymount, Co.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins Officials from the Government department charged with delivering the national broadband plan were accused in the Dáil of “cooking the books”.Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said senior officials in the Department of Public Expenditure made the accusation over the figures produced by the Department of Communications in its cost benefit analysis of the project.He said they noted “this project may never be delivered because the department doesn’t have capacity to oversee. The cost benefit analysis is not credible.“They’re saying that they were cooking the books, that the bidder doesn’t have the capacity and that there’s no incentive for the bidder to deliver after a number of years if further losses are incurred.”In the ongoing row over the Government decision to announce a preferred bidder to deliver high speed broadband to 540,000 households, farms and other businesses, he also highlighted questions about the capacity of the preferred bidder Granahan McCourt, the sole remaining contractor in the process to deliver the project and concerns it could abandon the project.“There is so little skin in the game from the investor,” Mr Doherty said.“He will have recouped all of his investments before the project has been delivered.”Senior officials questioned the bidder’s capacity to deliver the project and questions were raised about the bidder abandoning the project, which had not been addressed. And he said questions about alternative options had also not been properly addressed.But Tánaiste Simon Coveney said all the options had been looked at. Alternative have been assessed through the process but also before it. He added that the bidding process had taken three years.The argument had been made that technology may change and it could be done through mobile phones and wireless.But he said “the private sector is investing in fibre today because that is what is being demanded”.He said there would be 147,000 km of fibre on existing poles and he pointed to the bidding process taking three years.Mr Coveney stressed that there had been appropriate due diligence to actually test the capacity of the remaining bidder.Fianna Fail communications spokesman Timmy Dooley also raised concerns that the project may never be delivered.Mr Dooley said the Government announcement was aimed at boosting Fine Gael in the local and European elections on May 24th.The Clare TD said the Government claims were “bizarre” since no contract had been signed with the bidder, Granahan McCourt. The Government said the contract would be signed in six months’ time - but there was considerable doubt about that.“In fact there are real concerns that this contract will never be signed,” Mr Dooley said.He added that the announcement was effectively an admission that the deadline of 2020 for delivery had now been delayed to 2027. Could it really mean 2030 or even 2040, he asked.Mr Dooley also said the contractors would make back their investment inside eight years and own the network after 25 years, holding a monopoly of supply to people in the country.Mr Coveney said that if the Government had not made its announcement this week, they would have been accused of “delay and indecision”.This was the biggest ever Government investment in rural Ireland. The Cabinet had publicised everything right now and would continue this policy of openness.He could not say what the bidder’s investment in the project in which the State is investing €3 billion would be.That would emerge in due course, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Victim was on his way to work when his vehicle was hit by truck and forced under cabinN Korea launched number of rockets into the ocean last week, sharply raising tension on peninsula\u0026lsquoDemocratic front\u0026rsquo alliance claim they were robbed of majority in first election since 2014 military coupAsia Bibi arrives in Canada after spending eight years on death row over false chargesPM Imran Khan condemns attack claimed by splinter group of Pakistani TalibanNews Corporation attacks on Labor leader Bill Shorten widely condemned ahead of electionPair released under presidential amnesty after spending more than 500 days in jailCountry of 1.3 million struggles with infrastructure despite revenue from petrolRights groups and celebrities had called for boycott of Sultan\u0026rsquos hotels in response to lawState news reports operation involved multiple rocket launchers and guided weapons fired into East SeaDonald Trump says Kim Jong Un is \u0026lsquowith him\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquodoes not want to break his promise\u0026rsquoKing Vajiralongkorn inherits nation in political turmoil since army coup in 2014Federal elections are on May 18th but early-voting polls show Labor is slightly aheadWinds of up more than 190kmh uprooted trees and electricity poles in the state capitalNews of engagement broke after journalists noticed Jacinda Ardern wearing ring at public eventSuspects linked to bombings that killed over 250 last month believed to still be at largeKing Maha Vajiralongkorn\u0026rsquos fourth marriage comes ahead of coronation ceremony on SaturdayMeteorologists predict the severe storm to generate sustained winds of 170-180kmhRanjan Gogoi is accused of sexual harassment by former supreme court employeeSome of the militants behind Easter Sunday bombings still at large, says US ambassador"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3885212.1557334897!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"america s young have little interest in the world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tForeign policy: The Democratic presidential hopeful  most steeped in such policy, former vice-president Joe Biden, hardly brings it  up. Photograph: Ethan MillerGetty Towards the end of an almost-great career, which did not include his dream assignment as secretary of state, the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke confided in his diary. “The question constantly arises,” he wrote, after failing to win the ear of president Barack Obama, “how long do you want to do this?”The biography in which the quote appears, Our Man by George Packer, published this week, is meant as an elegy for the “American century”. It is too early for that. Relative decline is real but it is slow. Britain lost its economic primacy in the later 19th century but did not fall out of the first rank of powers until the middle of the 20th. The US should remain the most influential nation for a while yet.Instead, the book works better as an elegy for a certain type of Democrat. Holbrooke was outward-looking, diplomatic but open to the use of force, and restless to fix even the bits of the world that did not touch on American interests. The type has been familiar from Harry Truman’s time to Hillary Clinton’s. Much of the world is counting on its return if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election. In place of narrowness and paranoia: global leadership. To judge by the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, those expectations should be tempered.Diplo-waffleSeveral months into the race, almost none of the 20-plus hopefuls has said anything of note about foreign policy. The one candidate to define himself by the subject, congressman Seth Moulton, is trailing badly. The one most steeped in it, former vice-president Joe Biden, hardly brings it up. The party is as rich with ideas as it has been for a generation – universal healthcare, plans for climate change abatement – but they are either domestic or only tangentially international. There is plenty of diplo-waffle about respecting allies and recovering lost honour, but it all feels pro forma. It is not the pacifism or the isolationism or the realpolitik that is striking here. Those, at least, would count as policies, or at any rate impulses. What stands out is the indifference.US allies will find comfort in precedent. It is not as if the Democratic primaries of 1976 or 1992 were international relations symposia. Yet the first threw up Jimmy Carter, who struck the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, and the second produced Bill Clinton, who negotiated, via Holbrooke, the Dayton peace accord for the Balkans.Still, something deeper, more generational, seems to be at work this time. A new survey of public attitudes by the Center for American Progress, a think tank, finds that 59 per cent of baby-boomers – those born between 1946 and 1964 – and their elders believe the US should take a “leading role in the world”. Just 45 per cent of millennials and their juniors do. That will change as they age, you might think, but the number for the middle group of Generation X is just 46. In fact, lots of millennials and people born after them “hold no strong views whatsoever about any foreign policy or national security issue”.Triple fiascoIn other words, the Americans who are most keen on global burden-bearing will, to put it tactfully, stop voting over the coming decades. Governments must increasingly answer to an electorate that prioritises the domestic. Foreign policymakers might rather their craft take place in a Kissingerian bubble, sealed off from the mob, but such nuisances as the universal franchise will tend to get in the way. It matters, then, that millennial views of US leadership are so jaundiced by the triple fiasco of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. This generation will soon be the largest segment of the US electorate. It is already setting the tone in the Democratic Party. The “liberal international order” (a phrase lost on voters, says the Center for American Progress research body) is not, despite the way it is sometimes discussed, a product of nature. It is the product of circumstances that have obtained for not all that long. One of these was a generation of willing Americans. That will has been slipping for a while. Now romanticised as a global citizen, Obama was at the time thought tentative and parochial, as was Clinton and, before the attacks of 911, George W Bush, too.At some point, it will register on the critics that inidual politicians matter less than the popular constraints on them. By skirting foreign policy, the Democratic candidates are being, well, democratic. If Trump loses to one of them, US allies can certainly count on a more gracious and predictable successor. But on not much more than that. In the end, the question Holbrooke asked himself is for voters at large, the ultimate underwriters of Pax Americana. “How long do you want to do this?” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignBrexit latest news: ​Philip Hammond says Tory leadership contest must conclude \u0026#39as quickly as possible\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Theresa MayPrimary school Sats are necessary to show that taxpayer money is being well spent, Ofqual chair saysComment: My fellow Remainers should be terrified of the Brexit Party\u0026#39s mercurial riseDavid Beckham banned from driving for six months after using mobile phone whilst driving Bentley through West EndArcheologists find secret chamber decorated with centaurs and a sphinx inside Nero\u0026#39s palace in RomeArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor: the meaning behind the new royal baby\u0026#39s nameRoyal baby Archie: first picture and everything we know about Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s baby boyControversial airline ‘protection’ tax could add 50p to the cost of all flightsComment: David Gauke may be too late to stop the next Tory leader going gung-ho for a no-deal BrexitGirlfriend of London Bridge victim had \u0026#39premonitions\u0026#39 of terror attackUniversities risk \u0026#39damaging\u0026#39 students by giving them unnecessary counselling, report findsDanny Baker fired by BBC for tweeting royal baby chimpanzee pictureBullocks called Ally and Noel cause a storm in Hamish Macbeth village Warning over global failure to act on deaths from drug-resistant TBRural lifestyles drive the global obesity epidemic, report warns Prince Charles criticised by official sex abuse inquiry over \u0026#39misguided\u0026#39 relationship with Bishop BallBerlin park sets up designated spots for drug dealers in real-life \u0026#39Hamsterdam\u0026#39African swine fever vaccine shows promise in wild boar, study findsNorth Korea launches two ballistic missiles amid stalled talks with USWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/09/TELEMMGLPICT000196457071_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqVV3O4fliYhybKGByz6q2IJEcrI_P6D6vD2jxmt7La_s.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"archeologists find secret chamber decorated centaurs sphinx","story":"The chamber has been dubbed the Sphinx RoomArcheologists have chanced upon an underground chamber decorated with images of panthers, centaurs and a sphinx in the remains of a vast palace built by the Emperor Nero in Rome.The room, which was part of the huge Domus Aurea palace built by the emperor in the first century AD, had remained hidden for nearly 2,000 years.It was discovered by accident during restoration of an adjacent area of the palatial complex, which was built on by subsequent emperors, including Trajan, and now lies interred beneath a hill next to the Colosseum in the historic heart of Rome.Paintings on the walls of the chamber included this centaurThe colours of the frescoes, which depict mythical water creatures as well as a crouching sphinx, a panther leaping at a man armed with a sword, the god Pan and a centaur, are remarkably bright given their age.The chamber has been dubbed by archeologists the Sphinx Room. The discovery was of “immense artistic and archeological value,” said Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum archeological park, which includes the Domus Aurea.The images were probably painted by imperial Roman craftsmen between 65AD and 68AD, said Alessandro D’Alessio, the official in charge of the Domus Aurea, or Golden Palace.Much of the 15ft-high chamber is still filled with dirt, which will be excavated in the next few months. That could bring to light further discoveries.“We hope to finish the work by the end of the year,” said Prof Russo. “The room is well preserved but it needs cleaning and restoration.”The palace was built by Nero after the great fire of AD64, which devastated Rome. He is famously said to have fiddled, or played a lyre, while the city burned – a story that historians dismiss as fable.The paintings discovered included a man, armed with a sword, being attacked by a panther Nero’s palace was so large, with its courtyards and landscaped gardens, that it covered three of Rome’s seven hills.It even featured a revolving dining room, according to the historian Suetonius. “There was a circular banquet hall, which revolved incessantly, day and night, like the heavens,” he wrote.But after Nero’s death, much of the palace was obliterated by his successors.The Colosseum, where gladiators fought each other and wild animals, was built on the site of a vast ornamental lake that Nero had created.The Emperor Trajan built baths on top of part of the complex.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: ​Philip Hammond says Tory leadership contest must conclude \u0026#39as quickly as possible\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Theresa MayPrimary school Sats are necessary to show that taxpayer money is being well spent, Ofqual chair saysComment: My fellow Remainers should be terrified of the Brexit Party\u0026#39s mercurial riseDavid Beckham banned from driving for six months after using mobile phone whilst driving Bentley through West EndArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor: the meaning behind the new royal baby\u0026#39s nameRoyal baby Archie: first picture and everything we know about Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s baby boyControversial airline ‘protection’ tax could add 50p to the cost of all flightsComment: David Gauke may be too late to stop the next Tory leader going gung-ho for a no-deal BrexitGirlfriend of London Bridge victim had \u0026#39premonitions\u0026#39 of terror attackUniversities risk \u0026#39damaging\u0026#39 students by giving them unnecessary counselling, report findsDanny Baker fired by BBC for tweeting royal baby chimpanzee pictureBullocks called Ally and Noel cause a storm in Hamish Macbeth village Warning over global failure to act on deaths from drug-resistant TBRural lifestyles drive the global obesity epidemic, report warns Prince Charles criticised by official sex abuse inquiry over \u0026#39misguided\u0026#39 relationship with Bishop BallBerlin park sets up designated spots for drug dealers in real-life \u0026#39Hamsterdam\u0026#39African swine fever vaccine shows promise in wild boar, study findsNorth Korea launches two ballistic missiles amid stalled talks with USPrince Harry leaves royal baby Archie just three days after birth to head to the NetherlandsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"danny baker apologises unthinking gag deletes royal baby monkey","story":"The BBC described Danny Baker as having made \u0026#39a serious error of judgment\u0026#39Broadcaster Danny Baker has been fired by the BBC after he tweeted a joke about the Duke and Duchess Of Sussex\u0027s son using a picture of a chimpanzee.Harry and Meghan revealed on Wednesday that their new arrival was named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.Radio DJ Baker made a joke about the birth, tweeting a black and white photo showing a well-dressed man and woman holding hands with a suited chimpanzee.Baker captioned it: Royal baby leaves hospital. Following a backlash and allegations of racism given the Duchess of Sussex is mixed race, he deleted the post and apologised.On Thursday morning, he posted another message on social media, saying he had been fired by the BBC, later saying he had made a grotesque mistake.A BBC spokesman said: This was a serious error of judgment and goes against the values we as a station aim to embody. Danny\u0027s a brilliant broadcaster but will no longer be presenting a weekly show with us.Speaking outside his Blackheath home, he admitted his relationship with the BBC has always been tense, and said he did not know the royal baby was Meghan and Harry\u0027s.When a follower pointed out to him that baby Archie\u0027s mother is mixed race, Baker said he immediately took the tweet down.Baker later hit back at his former employers, and tweeted: The call to fire me from BBC 5Live was a masterclass of pompous faux-gravity. Took a tone that said I actually meant that ridiculous tweet and the BBC must uphold blah blah blah.Literally threw me under the bus. Could hear the suits knees knocking. Baker added: For the record - it was red sauce. Always, in reference to the regular feature Sausage Sandwich Game on his Saturday morning Radio 5 Live show.  The segment takes a celebrity and gets two guests to guess which condiment the famous person would ask for if handed a sausage sandwich - brown sauce, red sauce or no sauce at all.Defending his actions on LBC, he accused the BBC of being weasly, adding that he made an innocent mistake.Speaking to his friend James O\u0027Brien, the presenter said: I used to do it on my show a lot, monkeys dressed as famous people with fairground music.Danny Baker\u0026#39s tweet, which he later deletedHe added: The BBC suddenly decides it\u0027s going to throw me under the bus, and that\u0027s the thing that stings. I mean, there\u0027s a tremendously weasly thing to do again. He accused them of giving credence to the idea he was revealed as a racist after all these years.Baker said he gave the BBC staff member who fired him short shrift: I was given a lecture - which I must say I terminated after about 30 seconds with a couple of words I can leave you to fill in. He said there were other broadcasters they wouldn\u0027t have done that to and that the broadcaster was siding with the vampires who didn\u0027t like me anyway.Many pointed out that Lord Sugar was not sacked from his BBC job after making a similarly ill-advised Twitter post comparing the Senegal football team to beach hawkers in Spain. After revealing he had been sacked, he updated his followers to say there were journalists knocking on his door. He further tried to explain himself and the choice of photograph, saying: Would have used same stupid pic for any other Royal birth or Boris Johnson kid or even one of my own. It\u0027s a funny image. (Though not of course in that context.)Enormous mistake, for sure. Grotesque. Anyway, here\u0027s to ya Archie, Sorry mate.He had earlier said: Sorry my gag pic of the little fella in the posh outfit has whipped some up. Never occurred to me because, well, mind not diseased.Soon as those good enough to point out it\u0027s possible connotations got in touch, down it came. And that\u0027s it.The 61-year-old, who presents a weekly show on BBC Radio 5 Live, had apologised on Wednesday evening, saying the joke was intended to poke fun at the Royal family.He said: Once again. Sincere apologies for the stupid unthinking gag pic earlier. Was supposed to be joke about Royals vs circus animals in posh clothes but interpreted as about monkeys \u0026amp race, so rightly deleted.Royal watching not my forte. Also, guessing it was my turn in the barrel.Lifelong Millwall supporter Baker appeared on I\u0027m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2016. It is not the first time he has been in hot water with the BBC.In 2012, he delivered an extraordinary on-air rant criticising BBC bosses for dropping his afternoon show and asking him to stay quiet about it.He has also been sacked by 5 Live before. In 1997, he was fired for encouraging listeners to heckle a referee.Baker took several months out of radio after announcing in November 2010 he had cancer. He started chemotherapy and radiotherapy the following January and was given the all clear in June 2011 and returned to radio shortly afterwards. Blue Peter presenter Richard Bacon was sacked in 1998 after he admitted taking cocaine. Addressing his departure from the popular children\u0027s show, the then head of BBC children\u0027s programmes Lorraine Heggessey said: It is sad that such a talented presenter as Richard Bacon has not only let himself and his colleagues down but, most important of all, he has let down the millions of children who watch Blue Peter.Bacon, who was 22 at the time, said: I have been stupid and regret making a silly mistake experimenting with drugs.But I have learned the lesson the hard way and I hope it serves as a lesson to lots of other young people. I would also like to apologise to all loyal Blue Peter viewers.The TV and radio host eventually left the BBC under a cloud after the fallout of his and Russell Brand\u0027s lewd messages to Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs. A pre-recorded edition of The Russell Brand Show aired on Radio 2 in October 2008Sachs was scheduled to be interviewed over the phone on the show. Shortly before he was called, Brand told listeners: “In a minute we\u0027re going to be talking to Andrew Sachs, Manuel actor. The elephant in the room is, what Andrew doesn\u0027t know is, I\u0027ve slept with his granddaughter.”When Brand and fellow Radio 2 DJ Jonathan Ross, who was co-hosting, tried to call Sachs during the pre-record, he does not pick up.Ross and Brand left Sachs four voice messages on the then 78-year-old’s home phone, during which Brand joked about the fact that both he and Sachs had appeared on The Bill.Ross is recorded shouting: “He f----- your daughter”, much to the ribald laughter of everyone in the studio. This sparked a run of messages that were, nominally, Brand and Ross trying to apologise for the outburst, but swiftly became increasingly offensive. Later in the show, Brand joked about Sachs committing suicide in the wake of the revelations, saying: “The main news again. Manuel Andrew Sachs hung himself today . . .\u0027”Despite the fact the show was pre-recorded, producers and executives at the BBC greenlit it to be aired on the radio, and didn’t cut the recording of the voice messages left on Sachs’s phone. The Corporation later said that “a senior editorial figure signed off the programme, including its strong language, before it was broadcast”.Lesley Douglas, Controller of Radio 2, resigned within two weeks and Ross was suspended without pay from all BBC shows for three months.Ross later left the BBC in January 2010, saying: I think it\u0027s not a bad time for me to move on. It\u0027s possibly not a bad time for them either. On March 25, 2015,  Jeremy Clarkson was told his BBC career was over and that Top Gear would continue without.The presenter had failed to maintain standards of decency and respect at work, Lord Hall said.Clarkson was found guilty of a physical altercation accompanied by sustained and prolonged verbal abuse of an extreme nature that left his victim, Oisin Tymon, in need of hospital treatment at an A\u0026ampE department.Announcing the news, previously reported in the , Lord Hall said: “It is with great regret that I have told Jeremy Clarkson today that the BBC will not be renewing his contract. It is not a decision I have taken lightly.“I know how popular the programme is and I also know that this decision will ide opinion.”It was the straw that broke the camel\u0027s back for the broadcaster, having sparred with the controversial presenter for a number of years. A month after his Radio 2 colleague Chris Evans announced he was leaving, Simon Mayo followed suit after a backlash from listeners over his pairing with Jo Whiley.The DJ announced on October 22 he would depart to spend more time writing novels, after a troubled few months for the drivetime show.BBC bosses decided earlier in 2018 that Whiley would share presenting duties, in part to address concern over a lack of female voices on the airwaves.Simon Mayo on why \u0026#039two old white guys\u0026#039 wouldn\u0026#039t get on the radio todayBut listeners soon complained at a lack of chemistry between the new pairing. An online petition called Bring back Simon Mayo and the dream team gathered more than 10,000 signatures. The presenter himself admitted that the upheaval had been “difficult and upsetting”.Within weeks of the relaunch the BBC was forced to issue a response, asking fans to let the show settle and to give it a chance. Radio 2 controller Lewis Carnie pledged changes, insisting “no show ends up where it starts”.But listeners were not reassured, and the complaints kept coming.The BBC faced calls to drop Lord Sugar after he tweeted a joke comparing the Senegal football team to beach hawkers in Spain.The businessman, who has appeared in The Apprentice since 2005, posted a doctored image of the team posing with sunglasses and counterfeit handbags last summer, and wrote: I recognise some of these guys from the beach in Marbella. Multitasking resourceful chaps.Embarrassingly for the BBC, his tweet coincided with the publication of the corporation’s ethnic ersity report, which called for a substantial culture change and recommended that managers be given compulsory cultural awareness training.The cross-bench peer and former chairman of Tottenham Hotspur was initially bullish when Twitter users called his comment offensive, saying: “Frankly, I can’t see that. I think it’s funny.”Babita Sharma, an anchor for BBC World News, wrote that his tweet was “vile”, to which Lord Sugar replied: “You make me sick.”But an hour later, having perhaps taken some advice from the BBC, he issued a contrite statement that read: “I misjudged my earlier tweet. It was in no way intended to cause offence, and clearly my attempt at humour has backfired. I have deleted the tweet and am very sorry.”The BBC decided not to sack Lord Sugar. John Inverdale, 56, sparked a furore in the summer of 2013 when he made the comment about the appearance of the French player, who had just won the ladies final at Wimbledon.The BBC received around 700 complaints after Inverdale questioned, on Radio 5 Live, whether Bartoli\u0027s father had told her, when she was younger, that she was never going to be a looker...a Sharapova... you\u0027re never going to be 5ft 11in, you\u0027re never going to be somebody with long legs, so you have to compensate for that.Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon 2013The presenter later attempted to clarify the ham-fisted comment and said that he had written to Bartoli to apologise for using a clumsy phrase.The presenter, who a year later signed up with Bartoli to commentate for ITV on the French Open, told Radio Times magazine that as well as feeling unwell, he was attempting to fill time.The two-time Olympic swimming champion said she laughed at comedians who made jokes at the expense of others, so had no right to expect special treatment.Frankie Boyle joked on television that Adlington looks pretty weird... like someone who\u0027s looking at themselves in the back of a spoon.Rebecca Adlington in the pool in 2008 at the Beijing Olympic GamesThe remark on BBC Two satirical show Mock The Week, made in 2008, earned a reprimand from the BBC Trust who branded it humiliating and offensive.Adlington went on to make a formal complaint through her agent, arguing that the reprimand was nothing more than a slap on the wrist.Peter Alliss said in 2017 he would try to be less of a dinosaur as he commentated on the Masters.The 88-year-old has worked for the corporation for 58 years, establishing himself as the voice of British golf in he process. However, he has come under increasing criticism over recent years for remarks, which many believe to be sexist.Hazel Irvine and Peter Alliss during the third round of the Ricoh Women\u0026#39s British Open at the Old Course, St Andrews in 2003Alliss continued: I think women are more delicate than men. I like holding chairs for women. I enjoy the company of women. I don’t want to be bullied by them. I don’t care for macho women, I don’t care for them very much. And yet they’re prevalent today, and very prevalent in some cases. And very forward. After the 2015 Open, the BBC felt obliged to apologise for Alliss’s aside about Zach Johnson’s wife, Kim Barclay, as he stood over the putt to win the Claret Jug.She is probably thinking - \u0027if this goes in I get a new kitchen\u0027, Alliss said. Earlier that year he had caused consternation when telling the Radio Times that the Equality Act had buggered up the game.Brexit latest news: ​Philip Hammond says Tory leadership contest must conclude \u0026#39as quickly as possible\u0026#39 as pressure mounts on Theresa MayPrimary school Sats are necessary to show that taxpayer money is being well spent, Ofqual chair saysComment: My fellow Remainers should be terrified of the Brexit Party\u0026#39s mercurial riseDavid Beckham banned from driving for six months after using mobile phone whilst driving Bentley through West EndArcheologists find secret chamber decorated with centaurs and a sphinx inside Nero\u0026#39s palace in RomeArchie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor: the meaning behind the new royal baby\u0026#39s nameRoyal baby Archie: first picture and everything we know about Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s baby boyControversial airline ‘protection’ tax could add 50p to the cost of all flightsComment: David Gauke may be too late to stop the next Tory leader going gung-ho for a no-deal BrexitGirlfriend of London Bridge victim had \u0026#39premonitions\u0026#39 of terror attackUniversities risk \u0026#39damaging\u0026#39 students by giving them unnecessary counselling, report findsBullocks called Ally and Noel cause a storm in Hamish Macbeth village Warning over global failure to act on deaths from drug-resistant TBRural lifestyles drive the global obesity epidemic, report warns Prince Charles criticised by official sex abuse inquiry over \u0026#39misguided\u0026#39 relationship with Bishop BallBerlin park sets up designated spots for drug dealers in real-life \u0026#39Hamsterdam\u0026#39African swine fever vaccine shows promise in wild boar, study findsNorth Korea launches two ballistic missiles amid stalled talks with USPrince Harry leaves royal baby Archie just three days after birth to head to the NetherlandsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 9 may 2019","story":"A displaced Syrian child sits in a field near a camp for displaced people in the village of Atme, in the jihadist-held northern Idlib province. In the olive grove in Atme, dozens of families have spent the night on thin mattresses or blankets layed out over rugs on the red earth.

The number might\u0026nbspget to 15 million by the mid-2020s, up from 10 million, “if the conditions are right, especially the regulatory and policy enablers”.\u0026nbspBT telegraph pole removed for blocking plaque for leading suffragetteKlopp won’t focus on Liverpool vs Barcelona or ‘b******t like that’BT advert banned for unsubstantiated broadband speed claimsJansen saying that is a bit like Jurgen Klopp telling Liverpool fans he can win the Champions League if conditions are right, “especially the referee and linesmen enablers”.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is that OfCom is currently fixing up its regulatory framework for 2021-2026. BT would also like the government to grant it some relief on the business rates it has to pay on the fibre it lays. If it sounds odd that the taxman charges the company for these, remember those cables represent real moneymaking businesses even if their premises are holes in the ground.\u0026nbspIf Jansen gets what he wants,\u0026nbspmaybe the “ambition” to connect 15 million homes and businesses by the mid-2020s will turn into a firm target with a less woolly date attached to it.\u0026nbspLet’s be clear here. The company has a right to make a return on its investment, but its past history in this area isn’t all it might be. It’s open to the charge that it has used the infrastructure monopoly it has long\u0026nbspenjoyed in large parts of the country to fund a fat idend for\u0026nbspinvestors at the expense\u0026nbspof the national interest.\u0026nbspThis has put an unnecessary brake on the economy and left the UK lagging behind its competitors. It is one of the reasons regulators forced the semi-separation of OpenReach, BT’s\u0026nbspinfrastructure arm that is a big contributor to BT’s payout, from the rest of the group. Many critics argued that didn’t go far enough. They wanted\u0026nbspthe company\u0026nbspbroken up.\u0026nbspRight now BT and its referees are playing nice because nothing’s been finally decided. There’s a lot of positive talk about constructive discussions, etc.OfCom is likely to set out different rules for BT in different areas of the country, depending on whether there’s competition or not.\u0026nbspThis makes sense. New companies have moved in to join it\u0026nbspand Virgin, and some of them are even having a go at connecting rural areas, where the lack of reliable broadband seriously hampers the\u0026nbspeconomic outlook. They’re having a beneficial impact. The rate of fibre connection has doubled nationwide.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

As well as admission to the game for two people, the package included travel and hotel, as well as spending money for during the trip.In the emails sent out to customers, and addressed with their name, they were told they had actually won that prize, and should get in touch to get hold of it. Numerous people who receive the email say they believed it to be true, and some even claim to have already started making preparations for the trip.But it quickly became clear the message had been sent to a huge number of Zavvi\u0027s customers. Only one person will get the tickets, it has since confirmed, and so receiving the email does not mean anything at all.We’re extremely sorry to have got our loyal customers’ hopes up, however due to human error a mistake was made with our mail-out and unfortunately there is only one winner of the tickets, a spokesperson said.Created with Sketch.

New versions of iOS are actually in development right through the summer – and even after that, through further updates.New iPhone software update leaks, showing variety of new featuresThe full version usually arrives at the same time as the new iPhone. That comes some time towards the end of September, and there\u0027s no reason to think it\u0027ll be any different this year.Traditionally, the beta is released straight after the announcement concludes. Only developers can download it at first,\u0026nbspthough there are occasionally ways to get it onto your phone even if it isn\u0027t registered.A few weeks after that, the public beta usually opens. At that point, users can sign up and get their hands on the software – though it can often be buggy, and Apple asks you to provide feedback in return for the early access, it can be an exciting if risky way of getting a look before anybody else.Many of the features that are said to be coming to the operating system have already been revealed in various leaks. Those rumours suggest that the upgrade could be relatively minor, at least in terms of spectacular features – allowing Apple another year to concentrate on improving stability and performance – but that there will be plenty of smaller upgrades to make using the iPhone and iPad a better experience.Perhaps the most eye-catching (or eye-resting) of the various updates is the addition of dark mode. That will allow users to invert the colours so that the phone is largely white-on-black, meaning that the screen should be less dazzling and helping to preserve the phone\u0027s battery.Plenty of Apple\u0027s own apps will get updates too.\u0026nbspReminders, Screen Time, Mail, Home, Books, Maps and iMessages\u0026nbspare all rumoured to be getting small tweaks.Perhaps the most significant of those will be the Health app, which will be given a more comprehensive today feature to allow users to see how their activity more quickly, as well as the addition of hearing health and period tracking capabilities.The iPad will also get its own upgrades, including changes to how users switch between apps and the option to use two versions of the same app at the same time.WWDC tends not to have a huge number of hardware announcements, and those there are tend to be Macs rather than iPhones.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The top-grossing film of all time is still Cameron\u0027s Avatar (2009), with $2.8 billion at the global box office.Marvel has ignored queer people’s existence for too long Avengers directors tease Captain America’s future in MCUEvery Marvel Phase 4 film announced so farReviews for Endgame have been mostly positive. The Independent’s Geoffrey McNab wrote: “The wonder here is the very dexterous way the film deals with such intricate subject matter. This is an extraordinary feat of planning and logistics.\u0026nbsp“The Russo brothers, working from another screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, are dealing with death, bereavement and separation but show remarkable lightness of touch and humour in the way they do so.One of the most impressive elements is the ease with which the film switches back and forth in time, seamlessly changing storytelling styles.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is, the company says, the biggest problem with wearing shoes, and bad fit leads to uncomfortable sneakers, worse performance, and people returning shoes or just simply not deciding to buy new ones. And now Nike says, that widespread problem – attested to by unworn shoes found around people\u0027s houses, and blisters and blood on people\u0027s feet – is fixed.It says it has done so with the invention of a new app that will encourage people not to pick shoes by selecting a number, but instead scanning their feet. By using a phone\u0027s camera, the new app will gather a full picture of the size of your foot – and then use that to decide which shoe to send you.Eventually, Nike thinks we might be able to do away with sizes entirely,\u0026nbspwith shoes instead turning up at your door without a number or gender written on them, and instead with just your name. But for now, the company wants to change how you get to that size.While shoes have changed in a variety of unrecognisable ways, the fundamental way that they\u0027re fitted to your feet hasn\u0027t altered much since the 14th century. Back then, cobblers would grab hold of a piece of equipment called a last, built to represent a foot, and sew up the material to make the shoe around it so that it would fit to people\u0027s feet.Those shoes eventually formed into a standard size, which remains in place as the numbers used across the world today. That all happened\u0026nbspso long ago that they are based on the dimensions of kernel of barleycorn.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

The sewing might be done by machines and the lasts might be made out of the latest materials, but the way they are fitted around the feet and the numbers used to describe that fit is unchanged.Nike says it has improved the shoe so good it became controversialIt is a process prone to error: most people are in the wrong sized shoes. More than a quarter of shoes come back to stores because they don\u0027t fit, and Nike thinks that the number is actually probably even higher when it accounts for the people who simply go on wearing badly fitted sneakers, or don\u0027t ever wear them at all.That leads to a whole variety of problems. Rubbing, blisters and blood will all be familiar\u0026nbspto just about anyone who has ever worn shoes for athletes, it can mean not just pain but poor performance, since shoes are built to fit precisely onto the foot.Nike founder Bill Bowerman, for instance, was famous for ripping apart standard shoes and resewing them to fit around the feet of the athletes he was training. Shoe companies have been trying to do the same on a broader level ever since, though the problem has stayed largely the same.The technology currently\u0026nbspused to try and fix that problem is decades old in itself. In Nike stores around the world – and just about every other shoe shop – the piece of machinery known as a Brannock Device tries to assess people\u0027s feet by pushing sliders around to measure them at their widest and their longest, but that in itself can lead to badly fitting shoes.Nike thinks that has been fixed by the new technology known as Fit. It uses a phone\u0027s camera to scan the feet, combines that with augmented reality technology to understand just how big they are, and then feeds that into its vast array of data about the shoes that it makes.It thinks that technology is not simply going to make shoes fit better, by taking into account the precise dimensions of the foot and the lacing, fit, stitching and materials of the shoe. It thinks it could fundamentally alter the way people buy shoes, and make the traditional barleycorn-based measurements out of date.Size is a lie, Nike says. And it claims its new app is ready to tell you the truth.The new feature will appear initially inside of the Nike app, as well as in a slightly different experience in stores. But both rely on the same basic principles, if they are presented in different ways.When it launches, anyone heading into the app to buy shoes will be presented with the normal list of sizes when they do. But they\u0027ll also be told about Nike Fit, alongside a button offering them the option to try it.Pressing that will open up the camera and a whole host of instructions. They\u0027ll be told to allow the phone to scan their floor so it can get a sense of proportion. After that they\u0027ll stand next to the wall and simply point the shoe at their foot.At that point, the phone starts doing its work. It uses computer vision to scan the foot – using only the camera of the camera and the capabilities of the app – and then combines that with data science to scan the foot and read what it says are dozens of different datapoints about the size of your feet.Once it has those measurements, offering a precise picture of your foot morphology, it is fed into a machine learning model that is learning how feet are sized over time. By combining that information about your feet with all of Nike\u0027s information about its shoes, it can compare the two and decide what shoe size you actually need.That measurement might vary with the shoes it might even be different for alternative versions of the shoe, because of the way the materials work. (This writer\u0027s feet were generally a size above what had been expected, and had a range of a range of three different sizes for different shoes.) The measurement might even vary between your feet, with one slightly larger than the other, and in the future it could be possible to have differently sized inidual shoes to match.Getting this wrong could be very bad indeed. A huge number of people already suffer with wrongly sized shoes – and if the app got them even more wrong, then it could simply exacerbate the problem it was created to fix.Nike says it is confident it will work because it has been testing it in stealth mode for months. Some select Nike Stores have quietly swapped out the traditional Brannock Devices for the app, allowing the company to gather feedback and look at how the measurements match up.We\u0027ve had true measurable results that\u0027s inspiring confidence,\u0026nbspsays Adam\u0026nbspSussman, Nike\u0027s vice president and general manager for Nike Direct Digital and Geographies. That\u0027s why we also feel really comfortable going out with this so broadly so quickly because the results are pretty astonishing especially when you compare it to the results that you get with with a Brannock device.It will keep collecting that data as the app goes into use, rapidly collecting unprecedented amounts of data about the size of people\u0027s feet. (Nike says it takes the responsibility of storing that data extremely seriously, and that people will be able to remove it from their account if they desire.) It says that data will be fed back throughout the company, a process that could lead to new shoe designs or sizes.At the moment, the primary reason not to innovate\u0026nbspfurther and faster is a concern for consumers. People have lived with the traditional shoe sizing system for centuries – and it wil be a tough thing to change with a click of a camera and an app update.There is a consumer journey, and\u0026nbspyou have to bring the consumers along with you, says Sussman.\u0026nbspBut you can see it as completely redefining how you purchase the right product for you.Nike is aware that this could all be a little stressful. One way of trying to alleviate that is\u0026nbspthe app actually slows down the process of scanning your feet and shows a readout that is strictly unnecessary, just so that people can see it is doing something. That was part of a commitment to ensuring that the app was simple and non-intimidating no matter how complicated the underlying technology was, says Nike\u0027s Josh Moore, who led the design of the app.It\u0027s not the first time that Nike has introduced such new features into its app, or those based on augmented reality, which\u0026nbspis used heavily in its SNEAKRS app. The company used lessons\u0026nbsplearned from the introduction of those feautres to inform the new release, Moore said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the future, with even more work and more feedback, that could develop into new ways of understanding shoe size – or giving it up completely.I think there\u0027s some things that we have clear line of path or visibility to, says\u0026nbspSussman. And then there\u0027s some things that we don\u0027t even know where this could take us.That future could include shoes that are in some way post-size: not based on gender or barleycorns, but just chosen by a computer to fit as snugly as required around your feet. Nike has already experimented with abandoning size – it offered its Presto shoes in small, medium and large, which was neat but didn\u0027twork for more performance-focused shoes – and this new feature could be the leap forward required to take the numbers of boxes and replace them instead with your name.I believe that there\u0027s a way a view into the into the future that\u0027s not so distant from a technological standpoint that we can get there, says Sussman.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re just going to say: this is the right shoe for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yi Qi\u0026nbspwas the first specimen to be found with bat-like wings.\u0026nbspAt least eight to ten species of dinosaurs at the time had feathered wings, but only two had membrane wings, said Dr Wang.\u0026nbspThe fossil record is not complete and the feathered wing is more widely distributed so I think they probably evolved earlier.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our expectation is that all brands we work with are aware of and actively engaging with the issues surrounding palm oil and deforestation.”Consumers have become increasingly aware\u0026nbspof the devastation linked to palm oil, prompting\u0026nbspretailers to seek to reduce their usage of the commodity, but so far progress has been limited.Last year, Iceland attracted attention by becoming the first UK supermarket to commit to removing\u0026nbsppalm oil from all of its own-brand lines.Iceland accused of still using palm oil – despite promising to stopIceland said it would achieve its goal by the end of 2018 but in January it emerged that 28 own-brand products containing palm oil were still on sale and the company had removed its label form 17 other lines.Around 600 branded products containing palm oil were still available at Iceland, the BBC found.Nestle, the world’s biggest food manufacturer, attracted firm criticism from environmental groups over claims made last week that 77 per cent of the commodities used in its products were deforestation-free.Richard George, Head of Forests at Greenpeace UK said the claim “wholly contradicts” very recent discussions that Greenpeace had with Nestle.“We know Nestle continues to trade with some of the world’s guiltiest suppliers when it comes to deforestation for palm oil, soya and cocoa,” Mr George said.“Without further explanation, we can only conclude that this is a blatant and embarrassing attempt by the company to deceive its customers and absolve all responsibility for its contribution to the destruction of the world’s forests.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Like the Tories, Ukip, or the Brexit Party, a vote for Labour at the European elections is a vote for Brexit.The Liberal Democrats, with over 100,000 members and 2,500 councillors across the country, are the strongest Remain voice going into the European Elections. If you want to stop Brexit then vote for the Liberal Democrats.The European Union must focus on climate, security and growth after continent-wide elections in two weeks, or fall, French president Emmanuel Macron has said as its leaders met in Romania to chart the way forward following Brexit.The leaders of all members except Britain met on Europe Day in the town of Sibiu in Romania, where France\u0026nbspand seven other EU countries proposed getting to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.Work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd has sidestepped questions as to whether she would be a leadership contender when Theresa May steps down.Asked after a speech in London to employers whether she intended to throw her hat in the ring, Ms Rudd said: I feel incredibly fortunate to be in this role. There is a really important job to do about making sure we get Universal Credit right.She added: I am committed to the DWP.Ms Rudd said she believed Ms May should be given the time to meet her commitment to complete the first stage of Brexit before standing down as prime minister.We need to hold our nerve and allow her to do that. Brexit is a complicated procedure and the numbers in the House of Commons make that even harder, she said.But I believe that she has a plan now, hopefully to do a deal with Labour, if not to bring forward indicative votes. We need to back her on that.A delegation of pro-Remain MPs from the Liberal Democrats and Change UK have held talks with Theresa May\u0027s effective deputy David Lidington on their call for a confirmatory public vote on any\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal.Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and deputy Jo Swinson were joined by Change UK interim leader Heidi Allen and MP Anna Soubry for the talks in Whitehall.It is understood that Mr Lidington underlined Mrs May\u0027s continued opposition to holding a second referendum on EU withdrawal.No more meetings are planned, but both the Lib Dems and Change UK are said to be open to further discussions.One significant aspect of the recess announced by Andrea Leadsom this morning: it will make it almost impossible for Donald Trump to address parliament during his state visit to the UK.MPs will rise on\u0026nbsp23 May and return to Westminster on 4 June. The president will arrive in Britain on 3 June, and fly out again in 5 June.It is thought to be highly unlikely Trump would address parliament on the first day back following the recess, and Whitehall sources said the government had not requested him to.A source said: We\u0027ve not asked. It is not going to happen.Foreign leaders typically address parliament during formal\u0026nbspstate visits, but Commons\u0026nbspspeaker John Bercow had insisted Trump would be barred to underline Westminster\u0027s opposition to racism and to sexism.However, Bercow\u0027s stance had caused isions in parliament and he had come under pressure to reverse his position.Michael Gove has said Jeremy Corbyn couldn\u0027t even run a whelk stall as he claimed the biggest threat to the Welsh seafood industry was not\u0026nbspBrexit but a Labour government.Gove was responding in the parliament\u0026nbspto comments from Plaid Cymru\u0027s Liz Saville Roberts, who asked\u0026nbspduring environment questions what was being done to protect Wales\u0027s whelk industry once we leave the European Union.The MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd and her party\u0027s Westminster leader said it was worth £6.2m a year to the country\u0027s economy, and wanted to know if the fishermen would face tariffs of 20 per cent\u0026nbspto the crucial South Korean market after\u0026nbspBrexit.The environment secretary said he agreed it was vitally important to the Welsh coastal economy to make sure the trade in whelks with South Korea was protected, but added: The one threat to this trade of course would be the election of a Labour government at the next general election.Because as we all know the member for Islington North couldn\u0027t run a whelk stall.But the Environment Secretary was chided by Commons speaker John Bercow, who told the cabinet minister his jibe requires a little bit of work.Andrea Leadsom\u0026nbsphas refused to say if the Withdrawal Agreement go be put before\u0026nbspparliament next week, as she revealed MPs will get 11 days\u0026nbspoff as planned at the end of the month.MPs will rise for a\u0026nbsprecess at the end of 23 May, the day of the European elections, and return to parliament on 4 June.Commons leader Leadsom said the break was subject to the progress of business.The\u0026nbsp Liberal Democrats\u0026nbspare also\u0026nbspto launch their\u0026nbspEuropean elections\u0026nbspcampaign manifesto today, under the blunt slogan: Bollocks to\u0026nbspBrexit.In an unequivocally anti-Brexit document, the party calls for the failed project of Britain\u0027s withdrawal from the European Union to be disbanded.\u0026nbspIt sets out a blueprint for what the UK could achieve if Brexit was stopped according to the Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, who will formally unveil the manifesto this evening in east London.\u0026nbspA special edition of the manifesto has the words Bollocks to Brexit – a familiar message of enthusiastic Remain campaigners – emblazoned across the front cover while a second edition offers stop Brexit as its slogan for activists after a less crude message to deliver to voters on the doorstep.My colleague Ashley Cowburn has more:\u0026nbspSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today\u0026nbspthis morning, he also claimed\u0026nbspparty whips had\u0026nbsptried to blackmail him into voting for the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal by trying to dig dirt on him from former military colleagues.My ethos and values are separated from this government, he added.The government was warned it could be sued for up to\u0026nbsp£20m over the sourcing of no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspferry services, the\u0026nbspNational Audit Office (NAO) has revealed.Transport secretary Chris Grayling awarded contracts worth a total of more than £100m last December to three firms - Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight - to run extra services in the event of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit.Eurotunnel launched\u0026nbsplegal action, claiming it was unfairly overlooked for the work, and in March the Department for Transport (DfT) paid £33m\u0026nbspto the company in an out-of-court settlement.It has now emerged the DfT\u0027s\u0026nbspaccounting officer warned that Eurotunnel, the firm that operates Channel Tunnel services, could sue over the controversial procurement exercise.An NAO report said the DfT was advised that a procurement challenge was probable and likely to be successful.It was announced earlier this month all the contracts Mr Grayling had awarded were being scrapped at a cost to the taxpayer estimated at around £50m.The DfT said the usual procurement process was not followed due to reasons of extreme urgency brought about by events unforeseen by the contracting authority.Former cabinet minister Esther McVey announced that she will stand for the Conservative leadership when there is a contest.McVey, who quit as work and pensions secretary in November in protest at Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal, told TalkRadio: I have always said quite clearly if I got enough support from my colleagues, yes I would.Now people have come forward and I have got that support, so I will be going forward.The Tatton MP said the Conservative Party needed a leader who believes in\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspand had belief in the opportunities it could bring.McVey said that May\u0027s departure should be handled in a dignified and graceful way.We all know Theresa May is dutiful, she added. She has worked for public service for many years.The compromise\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal being discussed by\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn\u0026nbspwould deliver an £80bn hit to the economy after 10 years, economists have warned.People would be an average of £800 worse off,\u0026nbspGDP\u0026nbspwould shrink by three\u0026nbspper cent and there would be £13bn less a year to spend on public services, compared with EU membership, found the\u0026nbspNational Institute of Economic and Social Research analysis.The study – the first into the impact\u0026nbspof the mooted cross-party deal\u0026nbsp– was seized on by supporters of a fresh Brexit referendum as proof that a customs union must not be seen as a “soft option”.The Independent\u0027s deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, reports:Please allow a moment for this live blog to loadThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes.

who was third in line to the throne in  - is now sixth in line.His newborn son Archie is seventh in line to the throne.Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, born on May th  will take the seventh place in the queue, bumping Prince Andrew, the Duke of York down to eighth place.This moves Princess Beatrice and Eugenie down to ninth and tenth respectively.But who was dropped from the top ten Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, lost his top ten seat.Harry and Meghans newborn was introduced to the world on May , , but a name is yet to be announced. The rules of royal succession have changed signicantly in recent years.Leaders of  British Commonwealth countriesvoted in  to alter the centuries-old tradition to include daughters as well as sons.Previously daughters could only inherit the thronethere were no living sons.This system, which dated back  years, is based on the rules of primogeniture which gives preference to the firstborn male heirs of a king or queen.This change in royal succession means Princess Charlotte, as William and Kates daughter, is ahead of her younger brother.Previouslythe third child was male he would leap the princess in the line of succession.This new rule only takes into account children born after , meaning Prince Edwards youngest child, James, born in , is ahead of his older sister, Louise, born in .Commonwealth leaders also decided in  to remove the rule that no heir could assume the thronehe or she married a Roman Catholic.Then Prime Minister David Cameron said at the time: “The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter, simply because he is a man just isn’t acceptable anymore.Nor does it make any sense that a potential monarch can marry someone of any faith other than Catholic.“The thinking behind these rules is wrong.The Roman Catholic rule can be traced to the th-century reign of Henry VIII.The King broke with the Roman Catholic Church to orce his we, Queen Catherine, and marry Anne Boleyn.The changes, under the Succession to the Crown Act , came into force in March  but apply to people born after October , .Live Science reported that because one of the duties of the British monarch is to head the Church of England, no Roman Catholic can hold the crown.The basis for the succession was determined in the th century.When James II fled the country in , Parliament held that he had abdicated the government and that the throne was vacant.The throne was then offered, not to Jamess young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers, following the Glorious Revolution.At -years-old, Prince Charles is the longest-serving heir in UK history - having been first in line from the age of three - and would become the oldest ever British monarch to take the throne.Some royalists have argued that Prince Charles should step aside to allow Prince William to become King because he enjoys better approval ratings with the public based on a  poll.Prince Charles has faced controversy over his orce from Princess Diana and his affair during their marriage with now-we Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.He has also been accused of “meddling” in politics by stating his opinion on issues like the environment and farming, alternative medicine and architecture in private letters to Government ministers.In , Edward VIII - the Queens uncle - famously abdicated after less than a year on the throne so he could marry orcee Wallis Simpson.Prince Harry says no royal wants to be King or Queen — but they would do it for “the greater good”.The -year-old said: “Is there any one of the Royal Family who wants to be king or queen I don’t think so, but we will carry out our duties at the right time.”He told Newsweek magazine: “We are involved in modernising the British monarchy.We are not doing this for ourselves but for the greater good of the people.”And he insisted the royals were still vital, adding: “We don’t want to dilute the magic.“The British public and the whole world need institutions like it.”The long-serving royal has stepped back from a public role after  years of royal duties.His final solo engagement was The Captain General’s Parade in August , when he saluted the Royal Marines at Buckingham Palace.Due to English common laws, he cannot become king.The we of a king is known as a Queen Consort, and takes the title of Queen – although she doesn’t rule as the monarch.Buta female royal marries a man with a title below her own - as in the case of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip - she will retain the title while her husband will not be entitled to it.He is known as Prince Consort.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ive really got back into it and am really enjoying writing it.She added to Daily Mai: I’m not giving the plot away anyone can look up the cataclysm to come on Wikipedia."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000462198435.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit key dates 2019 timeline","story":"Here are some of key dates in the Brexit process.On November , , EU leaders agreed the UKs Brexit deal at the Brussels summit.The agreement on the UKs withdrawal was considered to be the best and only deal possible.On December , , Theresa May scrapped the vote on her Brexit in the Commons as it was due to fall to a heavy defeat.And on January  the Brexit vote failed by  votes to .

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit. They want it sorted. More than half the adult population want Out.This is natural Tory territory. All it needs is a decent leader.Right now, voters think ex-Tory Nigel Farage is the best on offer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can’t simply take something off somebody and refuse to pay them the proper price.Nobody will shed a tear for the handsomely paid CEOs in Corbyn’s line of fire. But the damage will be felt by all of us.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college.

In the meantime, can I recommend you watch the actor-to-stuntman handover, about four minutes into tonight’s EastEnders, as a topless Keanu escapes down Louise Mitchell’s drainpipe ’Costhat segment doesn’t win the Best Comedy Weight Loss category, something’s gone terribly wrong at next month’s Soap Awards.Piers Morgan: “My collar size used to be  and a half, it got to  and I didn’t like it.”And who would, on their first day at school But let’s talk about the here and now, Chunk.A MAJOR shock during the final episode of Channel ’s absorbing Sunday night series Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.Rugby player Ben Foden voluntarily withdrew, during the interrogation phase, having been subjected to several hours of “disturbing and repetitive noises”.The one thing you’d think he was prepared for, after marrying one of The Saturdays.Whatever demons those ungodly howls awoke in Ben, they didn’t seem to bother Frankie Bridge’s husband Wayne, who’s been the obvious and deserving winner of the series since episode one.The final was still well worth an hour of your time, though, just to see the interrogation of Made In Cha’s Sam Thompson, whose endless backchat, sulking and general toddler antics went down every bit as well as you’d expect with the show’s battle-hardened Special Forces veterans.“Are you pulling a fookin’ face ” “No, Sir.” “Then stop being a fookin’ c*** then.”When verbal threats failed to register, the staff tried guilt-tripping him by menacing Victoria Pendleton with two alsatians.A tactic that probably went down badly with all those people who think the real SAS operates like a community outreach theatre group, pacying hostile forces through the medium of dance and mime.Personally, I thought the whole series was so brilliantly executed it should become an annual fixture, with celebrities forced to do it at gunpointnecessary.And,anyone disagrees, just try telling me you wouldn’t like to see Gemma Collins shoved out of a helicopter backwards.THIS Morning, April , “The woman who can predict the future by throwing asparagus”, Jemima Packington: “Meghan’s going to have the baby by the end of April. Twins, one boy, one girl. By the end of April.”And I’m sure the other one will be out any moment, Jemima.Glenn Hoddle: “The defender’s lying down completely flat with his legs in the air.”APOLOGIES for the recent lack of EastEnders updates.Five months seemed a safe enough gap to leave, and I’m pleased to report the coupling’s been forgotten by everyone – including Louise Mitchell, who was blackmailing Sharon over the affair.There now also seem to be more people living at the Slaters’ house than in Basingstoke – and Robert Kazinsky has even ed from Hollywood to reprise his role as Jean’s prodigal son Sean, having clearly benefited from the experience of landing such stellar parts as Randy in Hot Pursuit and George Jetson in Robot Chicken.The bad news, though, is that EastEnders is on to its sixth version of the endlessly useless Ben Mitchell and, having gone through his gay, incontinent ballet dancer phase, this one clearly thinks he’s Michael Caine, trying to put the heat on Lola’s Geordie boyfriend with this less-than-menacing line: “I’m gonna come up to Noocastle, to that grotty little flat, above that grotty little shop, in Westgate, and I’m gonna kill ya. Any questions ”Just one.How come you’re not deaf any more No. But it is a really terrible f***ing idea. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the four years since the death of three-year-old Syrian boy Alan Kurdi - who was found washed-up on a Turkish beach in September  - more than , refugees have drowned or gone missing while trying to cross the Mediterranean.At Moria, Lena was shocked to find desperate families living in tents and packed into tiny rooms, bathroom facilities covered in faeces, and sex attacks taking place on men, women and children.While some rape victims were having to live and sleep near their attackers, young children were being forced to scramble through barbed wire fencing every day just to get to school.Lenas close pal, Larissa Murray, who accompanied the star to the camp, exclusively tells Sun Online that the conditions were so bad there was just one shower for every  migrants.She says: It was just awful, it was like a prison.People had to line up for their food three times a day - getting a croissant can take up to three hours. There are no cooking facilities so people cant cook for themselves, eventhey want to.Theres no hot water  and a lack of electricity. Its hellish.She adds: A lot of the women have been raped or abused in their own countries and theyre being placed in a camp with the perpetrators. Theres a lot of rape in the camp.At present, around , migrants are living at the camp, which is meant to house , - and more keep coming. Makesht settlements have also cropped up in the surrounding countryside.While those running the camp are doing the best they can with what funding they have, its not surprising that fights - and stabbings - among migrants are a common occurrence.Some people have even been kned to death in the long food queues.One little girl had to make her way through barbed wire fence to go to school. She said, fights break out every day, its almost worse than being in Syria, Larissa says.There is also a massive mental health crisis at the camp, with some children even trying to take their own lives - including a boy who attempted to hang himself from a pole.Most are already traumatised by what theyve experienced in their own countries, adds the -year-old, who lives in London.Shockingly, six in  people that the IRC spoke to admitted they had considered killing themselves. And almost  per cent had attempted suicide - either on the island or before they arrived.Larissa tells us Lena - who has two children of her own - spoke to youngsters during her March visit and was completely shocked by the conditions they were living in.Some were housed in tiny rooms with nine other people. While Moria is considered unsafe for all migrants, girls can be at particular risk of sexual violence and abuse.In an Instagram video during her trip, Lena, an IRC ambassador, described what she had come across as overwhelming.The actress said: Ive just come out of the Moria reception centre which is hugely overcrowded and inadequately equipped to take care of all these people humanely and safely.Theres sexual violence towards men, women and children, its pretty overwhelming in there.She adds: Ive met some extraordinary people that are hugely inspiring and help is needed.One inspirational person Lena met is Salam Aldeen, who has constructed a playground for the youngsters living at one of the most desolate and dangerous places on the planet.Aldeen, the Iraqi-Danish founder of the aid group Team Humanity, was moved to take action after a picture of drowned toddler Alan lying face-down on the sand made headlines across the world.He headed to Lesbos, where he set up the playground  metres from the camp, with inflatables, a small football pitch and a screen to play movies on - to allow migrant children to be kids.And now, he is trying to raise money for the ‘Hope and Peace Centre’, a safe space for women, babies and children to meet, socialise, listen to music, talk to each other and keep out of dangers way.The centre gives the migrants a little bit of a break from the horrors of the camp - but with the ever-growing population, it needs expanding so it can house more women and youngsters.Lena has urged her fans to help. It will make a massive dference to these people who really need it, says the star, who is supporting a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for the site.Pictures, shared with Sun Online, show smiling migrant women sitting together inside the centre, under a sign reading Peace.For now, they are safe. But come the evening, they will be forced toto the camp, where they are at risk of sex attacks, robberies, or even worse.To support the GoFundMe campaign for the Hope and Peace Centre, click hereOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And right across Europe it is the new populist parties which will hold the whip hand come May . Electors are furious about uncontrolled immigration, tired of the bureaucratic EU and sick to the back teeth of social liberalism.Like never before they are backing the populists, in countless countries across the continent. They already now run Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Estonia, having come from almost nothing ten years ago. But in these Euro elections the change will be even more dramatic.Across Scandinavia, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, more and more electors are deserting the centre parties for what the BBC, holding its nose between two fingers, likes to call the “far Right”.Largely nationalist parties which care about national sovereignty and do not care for immigration. Sometimes radical socialist parties which resent the bullying EU.The centrist liberals of the European People’s Party and the socialists are likely to be routed, a response to decades of mismanagement and arrogance. For the first time EVER they are unlikely to hold an overall majority.And the numbers of populists making headway will be swelled by our own generous contribution — because Nigel Farage is marching back to Brussels — and his Brexit Party will secure at least a few dozen seats on May . This is an enormous problem for the current, discredited, EU leadership.One Brussels panjan- drum said it would lead to “institutional paralysis” within the EU. My response to that is: How will we tell  But he is probably right.The new parties are opposed to everything the current administration stands for. They are Eurosceptics. They wish the EU to be a trading bloc, not a supranational government telling every country what to do.They are largely socially conservative. They have little truck with the identity politics of the liberals. And they hate uncontrolled immigration. This will lead to an enormous upheaval in Brussels.They’ve woken up and smelled the coffee. The liberals know that their cards have been marked. But what Europe faces is a year or two of wrangling as these new parties seek to exert influence over the EU.And it will be made worse by the fact that the European People’s Party is itself split over what to do about immigration. A good proportion of EPP members have woken up and smelled the coffee.It’s all a bit ironic, isn’t it  Three years ago we voted to leave the EU — for many of the reasons that have led to this surge for the populists on the European mainland.If the populists can gain control of some of the EU’s institutions, it might become a much more palatable organisation for British people.Ah well. But one thing is for sure. In the UK, in the US, in Brazil and in the EU, liberalism has had its day.

Arthur and James were among the favourites, but I had a cheeky bet on Jayden and Lee.Anyway, despite being only three days old, the kid has already performed a hugely valuable service to this country. He’s moved Prince Andrew down from seventh in line to the throne to eighth.HUGE respect to Liverpool for their astonishing comeback against Barcelona.A brilliant performance and it is always fun to see Lionel Messi sick as a parrot suffering from severe gastroenteritis and feather rot.That cheeky corner.

That was the conventional verdict.But the longer you look at them, the less loopy Lords Jug and Sutch start to look. Were they possibly not more sane than many of our “real” politicians It’s not asJug smashed mobile phones against the wall , shaved the back of his hands Peter Mandelson, or travelled by sledge to the Arctic Circle for a photoshoot with huskies vain nincompoop David Cameron.And Toby Jug certainly missed a trick by never granny-dancing on to a party conference stage to the strains of Abba. We had to wait for “dependable” dullard Theresa May to do that.Mrs May or Lord Toby Jug: Which was more deserving of being carted away by the men in white coats Which was closer to the public’s views  Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug. And that was a better slogan, was it not, than Mrs May’s daft, delusional  General Election claim that she was “strong and stable” She croaked it like a demented parrot. “Strong and stable” turned out to be as truthful as some fruitcake who marches along your high street claiming to be the King of Prussia.Our politicians love to pose as shrewd sentries outside the nation’s coffers. They boast about their cleverness and financial acumen and yet they propose blowing £billion — more likely £billion, say sceptics — on a swanky new railway line that may reduce journey times between London and Birmingham by just a few minutes. Few voters want the HS line yet MPs press on with it. Nuts.Mrs May, who is forever lecturing the poor about how our tight public finances bind her hands on necessary spending, gaily proposes giving the EU a £billion cheque for almost nothing in .Does the House of Commons pin her down and ask her what the blazes she is doing  Nope.Who is the bonkers one here  It wasn’t Jug who, hoping to look virtuous, told police to reduce stop and search, a decision which was followed by a dreadful rise in kne murders of black kids. That was another crazy policy of the turbulent, scowling, almost catatonic T May.If you meet MPs, as we politics reporters must, you will hear them say that our PM “has lost it” and “needs help”. These are not poor-taste jibes about mental health. They genuinely believe Mrs May is unwell. Yet they will not remove her from an office in which she has command of our Armed Forces. Who’s pottier here  Mrs May, or the MPs who indulge her Take a look at the  General Election manesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party. One of its policies was: “We will introduce votes at .” They clearly thought that was a comically absurd idea. Today it is national policy in Scotland and is supported for the rest of the country by the Labour Party.Another  Monster Raving Loony proposalwas: “Solving the problem of over-crowding in prisons by releasing all innocent prisoners.”Our political class has gone one better than this. It has sought to solve prison crowding by releasing GUILTY prisoners.Then there was the Loonies’ idea to give House of Lords seats to: “Anyone who writes a problem page in a national newspaper.” Daft, of course. Instead, Labour gave a peerage to minor TV personalityAlan Sugar.The last gem from the  Loonies’ manesto was a promise to hold: “A referendum on whether people want a referendum on Europe.”Good joke — except that it has come horribly true. We were told our  EU referendum was a “once-in-a-letime” chance to decide whether or not to stay in the EU.Many MPs now want to block that poll’s Leave result and say it was merely a rehearsal for another referendum.Nurse, we need more straitjackets here!RIP, Lord Toby Jug.

one group of , women who were given mg of progesterone twice daily as a vaginal pessary, while the other group of , were given a placebo.While the study did not show that progesterone could help all women who suffered early pregnancy bleeding, it was found to help those who had suffered a previous miscarriage.Of the  women given progesterone who had previously had one or two miscarriages, went on to have a live birth, compared with  women out of  in the placebo group .The benefit was greater for the women who had suffered three or more miscarriages, with a  per cent increase in the live birth rate in the progesterone group compared with the placebo group.Of  women with three or more previous miscarriages, went on to have a live birth, compared with  per centof women in the placebo group.The PRISM trial, which was funded by the National Institute for Health Researchand published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the largest of its kind.Arri Coomarasamy, professor of gynaecology at the University of Birmingham and director of Tommys National Centre for Miscarriage Research, said: The role of progesterone in women with early pregnancy bleeding has been studied and debated for about  years, however what we have previously lacked is high-quality evidence.The largest study before the PRISM trial had less than  participants, whereas our study had more than , participants and was of very high quality, which means we can be confident in our findings.Samantha Allen, , from Bradford, West Yorkshire, suffered a miscarriage in December  and was recruited to the PRISM trial in June  when she was nine weeks pregnant.She and her husband Stephen, , welcomed son Noah in February .It was on my birthday in November  when I found out that I was pregnant - it was the best birthday gt I could have hoped for, she said.However, my joy soon started to turn to concern when I began having some bleeding when I was around seven weeks pregnant and I ended up in AE.I had a scan and was told to come back on Christmas Eve for another scan.But then, on December , I started bleeding quite heavily and had to call an ambulance.I was taken to AE where I was told the baby had died when I was eight weeks pregnant and I was miscarrying.The following day, on Christmas Eve, I had to also go through the trauma of miscarriage surgery.Around  months later she found out she was pregnant again, but after seven weeks she began spotting and decided to go to the early pregnancy unit.She had a scan and was told they could detect a heartbeat but couldnt be certain so she was booked for a scan two weeks later.Samantha continued: The spotting continued during those two weeks so I was relieved when the second scan showed I was pregnant.Thats when they told me about the PRISM trial and I decided to take part.I was prescribed progesterone pessaries which I self-administered until I was  weeks pregnant.The bleeding stopped within a week of starting the trial.Noah was born weighing a healthy lb oz and is now -months-old.She concluded: Of course, well never know whether or not I would have miscarriedI had not taken part in the trial, orI had been part of the group that received the placebo.Either way, I feel fortunate and happy that I did participate.I hope the results of the trial will make a dference to the way women receive treatment moving forwards, and that I had a small part to play in that.Our finding that women who are at risk of a miscarriage because of current pregnancy bleeding and a history of a previous miscarriage could benefit from progesterone treatment has huge implications for practice.This treatment could save thousands of babies who may have otherwise been lost to a miscarriage.We hope that this evidence will be considered by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellenceand that it will be used to update national guidelines for women at risk of miscarriage.Jane Brewin, chief executive of the Tommys baby charity, said: The results from this study are important for parents who have experienced miscarriage - they now have a robust and effective treatment option which will save many lives and prevent much heartache.It gives us confidence to believe that further research will yield more treatments and ultimately make many more miscarriages preventable.Dr Adam Devall, senior clinical trial fellow at the University of Birmingham and manager of Tommys National Centre for Miscarriage Research, said: Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting one in five women, and vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy is associated with a one in three risk of miscarriage.Several small studies have suggested that administering progesterone, a hormone essential for maintaining a pregnancy, may reduce the risk of miscarriage in women presenting with early pregnancy bleeding."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000488508643.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"marks spencer chicken vindaloo kebab shop sandwich","story":"The supermarket has already brought out the curry filling which it boasts could be the hottest in the world, which punters cant wait to try.But MS has followed it up by announcing it is planning on bringing out the spiced mint lamb doner meat one.Its led to some shoppers at the swanky supermarket to get all hot and bothered for the fiery new flavours.MS tweeted: “Were planning a sandwich showdown.Vote for our next flavour and only the winner will get its chance to shine on shelves.What will you pick: Kebab Shop with spiced lamb OR a BBQ classic, Smokehouse Chicken Pick your #MyMarksFave – the winner will be in store later this month!Nearly , people have voted and Smokehouse Chicken has  per cent of the vote.Kieran Timothy wrote: I love spicy food, and safe to say the Marks  Spencer chicken vindaloo sandwich hits that brief! #BurningTongue.And another wrote: Sandwich news!

Turquoise is regarded as the love charm and is also a symbol of good fortune and success - maybe hinting at her love and hopes for health and happiness for her son.  of The press were told they had just  seconds to get their photos and a reporter could then ask three questions, however, the Duke and Duchess didnt rush them along and in the end the whole thing lasted three minutes.  of Meghan and Harry had wanted to take the photos on the steps behind Windsor Castle, in the same spot they posed for one of their official wedding pictures, but typical British weather meant this wasnt possible.  of Archie is seventh in line to the throne, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburghs eighth great-grandchild and the Prince of Waless fourth grandchild.  of Meghan has been praised by women around the world for helping to normalise how a new mums stomach looks after childbirth by not hiding her bump. of Meghan and Harry revealed the babys name just a few hours after meeting the press. They have to tell the Queen before its officially announced, so its likely they did this when they met her and Prince Philip afterwards.  of Prince Harry proved hes going to be a hands on dad by breaking tradition of the new mum holding the baby for the first photoshoot.  of Meghan thanked everybody for all the well wishes and kindness and said it meant a lot to them as a couple.  of The Duchess of Sussex put a loving arm around her husband as they walked away after they faced the cameras for the first time together following the birth of their baby.  of More OnArchie Harrison Mountbatten-WindsorMeghan MarklePrince HarryRoyal FamilyBabiesCommentsShow more comments"},{"url":null,"title":"englands inequality map revealed search","story":"NewsEnglands inequality map REVEALED: Search to see full figures for your areaEXCLUSIVE: Devastating new figures lay bare a North-South ide over education, health and living standards - with some workers earning £. an hour more than othersShareCommentsByAnnie Gouk:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsNew data reveals a north south ide in inequality \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNorth East workers earn £. an hour less than their counterparts in the South East, a damning study reveals today. The report by England’s human rights watchdog lays bare a North-South ide over inequality - with a postcode lottery in education, health, employment and living standards. The report “Is England Fairer ” is from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and was shared exclusively with the Mirror’s Data Unit. It shows that those living in the North East are particularly badly off, while those in the South East have the best le chances in the country - even out-performing London. The report finds that the unemployment rate in the North Eastis now nearly twice as high as it is in the South East . Nearly a third of workers in the North East are in low-paid workcompared to just a quarter of those in the South East .        And people in the South East earn £. more an hour on average than they do in the North East - with median hourly earnings of £. compared to £.. That means % of all children in the North East are currently living in poverty, compared to just % of children in the South East. Caroline Waters, deputy chair of the EHRC, said: “We are living in an increasingly ided society. “As the country grapples with Brexit , it’s more important than ever that we address the fractures in our society and ensure opportunities are shared fairly across the country. The report found a quarter of adults in the North Eastexperience severe material deprivation, compared to one in every six in the South East . Meanwhile, one in every three adults in the North East report poor health , compared to a fth of those in the South East .  People in the North West and the West Midlands are also often worse off than those living in the rest of the country. And while London beat the South East in some areas, such as earnings, the capital also has the highest proportion of people working in insecure jobs, and particularly high levels of poverty and poor health. The report compared  dferent data sets to put together a ranking of inequality. Ms Waters said: “Where you grow up should not determine your outcome in le.  “We’re seeing an increasing push to devolve power and build better infrastructure outside London. Local Mayors, councils, charities and businesses are uniquely placed to ensure that this is fair growth and doesn’t leave anyone behind. “Equality across England isn’t out of reach but dferent regions must work with and not against each other. “Organisations in all areas of England have something to share and by combining their experience and expertise, we have a much better chance of improving le outcomes for everyone, no matter where they live.” Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: This report lays bare the striking regional inequality that ides England, but which all-too-often gets left out of the national conversation. “For generations the North of England has been held back by Tory elites that have failed to invest, that have made decisions in the interest of the wealthy and powerful, and that have bodged regional devolution. A Government spokesperson said: “Creating opportunity across the UK will always be our priority, which is why we are investing £m over three years to deliver better educational outcomes and le chances in some of the most deprived areas. “We have also committed over £ billion through devolution and growth deals, helping further empower local people to make the key decisions that affect their lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"grenfell tories finally unveil 200m","story":"NewsGrenfell: Tories FINALLY unveil £m for cladding to stop another catastropheMinisters stepped in with the pot for  buildings after almost two years of disputes between building owners and the governmentShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political EditorOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPreviously the government said it was for private developers to fund the repairs after the fire at Grenfell Tower \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory ministers have been hailed for finally unveiling £million to stop another Grenfell - almost two years after the fatal tower block fire. The government stepped in to remove unsafe building aposcladdingapos, like that used on the West London block, from  privately-owned high-rises across the UK. Previously the government said it was for private developers to fund the repairs themselves. But dozens of freeholders and developers refused to pay to make their own blocks safe, leaving , people in limbo. Campaigners today welcomed the cash but slammed the government for taking almost two years to announce it after the blaze that killed  people. Grenfell United, a group of survivors and the bereaved, said it offered hope to people feeling at risk at home. But Polly Neate, chief executive of housing charity Shelter, said: It is a source of deep concern that, nearly two years after the devastating Grenfell fire, this dangerous cladding is still on buildings.    It is vital that it is removed as quickly as possible. The first priority of any government must be to protect its citizens, so we welcome todayaposs announcement. We look forward to seeing more detail on the scheme and hope it is able to work quickly and effectively to give residents a safe home. Chartered Institute of Housing chief executive Terrie Alafat said: Almost two years since the Grenfell Tower tragedy, it is quite frankly unacceptable that so many private tower blocks have been left with dangerous cladding, leaving thousands of people living in fear.Together with Inside Housing and many other organisations we have been calling on the government to end this scandal now - so todayaposs announcement from the Prime Minister is very welcome. Labour ’s Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: “It is welcome that the Government is finally giving some help to worried residents in private blocks with Grenfell-style cladding. But it is astonishing that it has taken Ministers almost two years to act. “The Government must now back the further steps Labour has been calling for, and set a deadline to make all blocks safe.” Lord Porter, Chairman of the councilsapos body the Local Government Association, said he had been lobbying for action since .    The Tory peer said: “This announcement will come as an enormous relief to leaseholders who are in no way to blame for the dangerous cladding on their homes. They have suffered for far too long. The money will be made available to remove aluminium composite material cladding from around  privately owned high-rise buildings across the UK. Building owners will have three months to claim the funds, with one condition being that they take reasonable steps to recover the costs from those responsible for the claddingaposs presence. Prime Minister Theresa May said: It is of paramount importance that everybody is able to feel and be safe in their homes. Thataposs why we asked building owners in the private sector to take action and make sure appropriate safety measures were in place. And weaposve seen a number of private building owners doing the right thing and taking responsibility, but unfortunately too many are continuing to pass on the costs of removal and replacement to leaseholders. Today I can confirm we will now be fully funding the replacement of cladding on high-rise private residential buildings so residents can feel confident they are secure in their homes. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government toldis why the lack of action by some private building owners was “completely unacceptable”. They added: “Due to lack of progress the government is looking at a range of new additional measures to get building owners to do the right thing.” Last week, the housing minister Kit Malthouse said: “We have been engaged across government to consider additional interventions, so that progress can be made more swtly.” He said he hoped to announce specic measures shortly. The department insists leaseholders were currently protected from remediation costs in  out of  residential buildings. “The growing list of owners and developers who have stepped in includes Barratt Developments, Mace Group, Legal  General, Peabody, Aberdeen Asset Management and Frasers Property,” he said. “In the social sector we are making good progress,” he added. “In the private sector, progress is slower I absolutely admit that. “We need to do something to speed that up, and we hope to increase the pace quite soon. Discussions are ongoing.

Johnny Mercer said he will no longer back government laws in the Commons - except for, erm, on Brexit - in a bombshell letter to the Prime Minister. The Plymouth Moor View MP, a former Army officer, said his decision was about the prosecution of veterans from Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq. But he also hit out at the alleged behaviour of Tory Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher and claimed recent behaviour of the whips forced my hand. He accused the party machine of a total loss of integrity and a breakdown of the normal way of doing things.” He added: The whipsapos office, the deputy chief whip, attempted to blackmail me into voting for the Prime Minister’s deal by going round some of my old colleagues in the military and trying to seethere were any stories they could use as leverage against me.”    There is no suggestion any Tory whips found incriminating evidence about Mr Mercer. And his aposstrikeapos is likely to have little actual effect, as there is almost no contentious non-Brexit legislation going through the Commons. He was accused of sulking in an interview with BBC Radio aposs Today programme. But he insisted: “My ethos and values may be slowly but very firmly separating from this government. There’s nothing loyal about watching the car go over the clf and not doing anything about it. The incident exposes how the Tory infighting has billowed beyond old guard, hard Brexiteers into newer, younger members of the party.    In his letter, -year-old Mr Mercer hit out at the historical prosecutions of ex-servicemen and women. Supporters say such probes are a natural and right part of the legal system, and can right wrongs of wars. But Mr Mercer claimed there is “usually no evidence at all” and said the government “singularly failed to act for four years now and I’m simply not prepared to put up with it any more.” He said he was not to prepared to vote for government legislation - except on Brexit - before clear and concrete steps to end the abhorrent process.  Mr Mercer has campaigned against the pursuit of legacy cases from the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq since he entered Parliament in . However, he has also alleged party whips tried to dig up information on his military past to blackmail him for backing Theresa Mayaposs legislation. He wrote in his letter: It has not been an easy decision to make. But this incident with your chief whip has forced my hand. It appears that my values and ethos may be slowly, but very firmly, separating from a party I joined in .

Instead he will use Mountbatten-Windsor, the familyaposs official surname used by all members who donapost have a title. However the name caused a huge row when it was first introduced back in  - decades before Meghan and Harry wrote it on little Archieaposs birth certicate.    Before marrying the Queen Philip was Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. However this wasnapost neutral enough so he adopted the name Mountbatten after his grandparents. When the then Princess Elizabeth had the coupleaposs first child Prince Charles, he assumed they would take on his name in the traditional way. But Prime Minister Winston Churchill didnapost agree, and wanted them to continue to use the name Windsor, which was the official Royal Family surname.    The Queenaposs grandmother Queen Mary agreed, and it caused such a row that the matter was even discussed in Parliament.

I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children. Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith even went as far as to suggest that the upset over the name was the reason for the  year age gap between Princess Anne and Prince Edward.    However when the couple fell pregnant with their third child Elizabeth was sitting on the throne, which changed things slightly. Philip reportedly refused to drop the issue, and in  she went to see the Harold Macmillan, who had then taken over as PM. She said she absolutely needed to revisit the issue and admitted it had been irritating her husband since . Finally a comprise was met, and on February ,  -  days before Prince Andrew was born - the Queen declared that she had adopted the name Mountbatten-Windsor.

Together with Prince William the Duchess met with members of the st Menai Bridge Scout Group where she used to volunteer. Malcolm Rogers, a Scout leader, said: It was a reunion of friends today. It was so lovely to see the Duchess again.  She really got stuck in with us and the children and, when we had a James Bond-themed party, she made a very attractive Miss Moneypenny. She told us today how much she enjoyed volunteering with us.

It was very exciting at the time, but really she was very normal with us.

They asked them a lot of questions about the environment. You can tell they really care. Prince William said he loved Llanddwyn and praised the children for helping to keep it clean. Anglesey was the home of the royal couple between  to  when the Duke worked as an RAF search and rescue pilot. The couple were spotted regularly around the island, with the White Eagle pub in Rhoscolyn becoming a favourite spot and the Duchess being seen in Waitrose in Menai Bridge.    As well as visiting Llanddwyn on Wednesday, they also went to the Caernarfon Coastguard Search and Rescue Helicopter Base, where they viewed the Sikorsky S helicopters and met members of the team, many of whom previously worked alongside the Duke at RAF Valley.

Julia, a -year-old YouTuber and singer, met -year-old political correspondent on Tinder last year. They both insist it was love at first sight and they have been inseparable ever since.Julia said: “We will not let any haters stop us because we just love each other.    “When I saw Eileen in person for the first time, I was just in awe of her because she is just the most gentle and lovely person ever. “She made me feel so good and she is just captivating.” Despite being together for less than a year the couple have moved in together and have even got a kitten.  Eileen said: “We are together because we are together and the age gap is something a reality but it is not something that I was looking for. “I wasn’t looking for a relationship at all, in fact, I was very happy on my own.”    Julia added: “I really think that age is just a number. “It’s really great and refreshing to find someone that is such a good match with me and is so similar to me in many ways.” Their age gap has never been an issue for the couple even when they’re mistaken for being a grandmother and her granddaughter. Eileen said: “We do get that thing a lot about mommy and grandmother. “It does offend me but I kind of understand that this person’s frame of reference is very narrow and I feel sorry for them.  “But it does make me upset a little bit.” Julia added: “I think we get hate comments mostly because of our age dference but also because we are gay and there are unfortunately still a lot of homophobic people out there.” And their age gap certainly doesnapost affect their sex le. The two aren’t shy sharing intimate details of their love le and say their sex le is great. Eileen said: “Julia and I have an extraordinarily good sex le, I have never been with somebody who is as exciting as her and fun as hell.”  Julia added: “I used to think that most older women wouldn’t be very sexually active or wouldn’t be that interested in sex le but I guess I was wrong.” Before flying to Julia’s home country Brazil to meet her partneraposs mother for the very first time, the -year-old admitted: “Some people think it is a bit weird that my mom is a few years younger than Eileen but it doesn’t bother me I think it is just a number.” Julia’s mother, Ingrid Sellge - who is eight years younger than her daughter’s partner – was extremely anxious about meeting Eileen for the first time. But after meeting her daughter’s older lover at the airport, she told Barcroft TV: “I didn’t imagine that Julia would have a girlfriend so much older but it’s not a problem for me. “I enjoyed a lot meeting Eileen and I was already used to the idea - and her being happy, for me is what matters.”  Julia and Eileen say that they have received nothing but support from both their families. Julia said: “[My family] know that Eileen makes me so happy, so that is all that matters, and that is what they want, they just want my happiness. “I know things have moved quite fast with us but sometimes it is just the way it is.” Despite their almost -year gap, the pair are planning their future together and have learnt to not let the judgement from others bother them and their romance. Julia said: “Sometimes we do worry about the future, Eileen most likely won’t live as long as me, it just really breaks my heart to think that we can’t grow old together.”  Eileen added: “We’ve talked about this, of course, but it’s a very hard thing to talk about. “I thought, long and hard, should I not get in this relationship  “Do I have a responsibility to turn around and say no  “Because there is such a big age dference. “Or does one just grab love and just take the responsibility of the knowledge in this situation  “We are together because we love each other, as Julia very beautully said once: ‘We couldn’t not be together’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum downs many energy drinks","story":"NewsMum who drank six can of energy drink a DAY says habit was worse than heroinSamantha Sharpe, , from now needs a pacemaker was told she was on the verge of Type Two diabetesShareCommentsByCarly Odell:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMum-of-three Samantha said her heart used to skip beats before she suffered blackouts \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three who drank six cans of energy drink every DAY now needs a pacemaker. Samantha Sharpe began to experience blackouts aged  after four years of binging on the sugar-packed beverages. The now -year-old also began to suffer with kidney stones and was told she was on the verge of Type Two diabetes due to the amount of sugar she was consuming daily. Now she is warning others of the dangerous health consequences of energy drinks. I have three children and I work so it was daily le that pushed me to drinking the energy drinks, she told Leicestershire Live. I work in the evenings so it got me through the day. It woke me up and got me a bit hyper. I also had eight months off work, which didnapost help how many I was drinking. In  I was drinking five or six a day until I had the pacemaker fitted in February .    Samantha, who now works evenings in a pub, was a cleaner when her energy drink addiction was at its height. It got to the point where I was drinking five energy drinks a day, she said. The drinks made my heart beat faster, which would cause palpitations, then after I would crash when I needed another one, causing my heart rate to drop to  beats per minute. It would give me headaches , Iaposd be grumpy, and Iaposd need another one to keep me going. I wouldnapost sleep and I had an overwhelming feeling of doom when trying to sleep. Itaposs something I havenapost experienced before, which made me want another one. And Iaposd have the shakes. I felt like a addict to the stuff. My family warned me but I didnapost listen. I went to the doctor over a year ago because I kept blacking out at home. I had a first degree heart blockage and it then extended to second degree. In February last year at Glenfield Hospital, I had a pacemaker fitted directly into the heart to help my heart . The pacemaker had to go through a vein in my leg. It was not a nice experience and my kids had to see me in and out of hospital.    Samantha, who lives in Hamilton said: Doctors cannot figure out the cause but have said that drinking energy drinks has not helped it. My sister, who is a nurse, said the addiction is worse than that of heroin, which I can understand because I needed it to help me be awake. After having her pacemaker fitted at the age of , Ms Sharpe said she has got a new lease of le. She said: I donapost blackout anymore and I canapost feel my heart messing up anymore. My heart used to skip beats. But I do have to go back to the doctors every six months and I have to have the pacemaker replaced every  years. I know I shouldnapost drink it anymore, but I have had one energy drink since and I could feel my heart racing, my kidneys hurting and a headache coming on. I thought to myself aposI canapost do this anymoreapos.    As a result of her health scare, Samantha says now canapost stand to see others drinking energy drinks - especially children. People do not realise how badly it affects you, she said. I have gone up to people previously who are buying the drinks and told them what happened to me. It breaks my heart when I see kids doing it. There is an age limit, but I still see mums buying it for their children. The effects of energy drinks need to be advertised more. I think everyone knows they arenapost good for you - but no one has ever said why they arenapost.

As well as tipping the scales at just under twice the average lb oz newborn, the New Zealander came out weighing the same as an  week old baby. Annika Reid, Nicolina’s midwe at Waikato Hospital in Hamilton, told the Waikato Times : “He’s a Hercules baby.  I don’t think that I’llanother baby that size the normal way in my career… it’s pretty unreal.” The midwe also expressed amazement that Tobias was born without a cesarean section. Do you know a bigger baby  Email us on webnews@trinitymirror    Tobiasaposs -year-old mum said she would have to go shopping after the birth as all the pre-bought baby clothes wouldnapost fit the hefty tot. One theory was that Nicolina had diabetes which can increase the chance of having a large baby. However the new mum tested negative for the disease, leaving doctors stumped as to why Tobias is so big. There were no signs Nicolina was carrying such a large baby, aside from really sore kicks that made her feel like her stomach was soft. Although she was two weeks overdue, that would typically only add a couple pounds onto a baby. While Tobiasaposs mum is cm, his dad is not particularly tall and his older brother Sage, , weighed a more typical lb oz at birth. Annika continued: I think the fact that we didnapost know about his size was a blessing in a way because I thinkwe had have known ... there would have been a lot of pressure fromto have a c-section.    Also it puts that thought into womenaposs head that, aposOh my god heaposs so big. Heaposs not going to fitapos ...

Nicolina told the New Zealand Herald : “He came out head first and once my midwe realised, she pressed the emergency button. “Heaps of doctors came in and helped pull him out. “Everybody was like, ‘wow, what a big baby’ and ‘how big is he’ everyone was really shocked.” According to the Guiness Book of Records the heaviest baby ever born was Babe, who weighed lb and was born to Anna Bates in Ohio, USA in .

In the Forces he has worked as a firefighter for the top brass in the RAF and the Royal Family. Then after qualying as a paramedic he ran a team of ambulance drivers. Super fit - he is virtually teetotal, has never smoked or taken drugs - he has completed the National Three Peaks Challenge and walked to the summit of Pen y Fan, the highest peak in Brecon. But, behind the facade, Ross was a broken man. His marriage had crumbled and he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorderafter witnessing horric scenes at work. There was a constant barrage on the front line, he says. I did a rough calculation of emergencies I attended. I was looking at ,-plus Iaposd been to in my career alone, of which one per cent were major stuff. Thataposs got to go somewhere. Ross even made two suicide attempts, driving to the coast to plunge off a clf. He was only stopped by a text from a friend. He also scouted out the perfect place to hang himself, and set off, rope at the ready, before pulling back at the last minute. But a chance introduction to Paul McKenna last November turned his le around after the celebrity hypnotherapist treated him with a new scientic therapy called the Havening Technique.    He has totally transformed my le, says Ross. I was literally exhausted. I couldnapost socialise. I would get home from work, put all the shutters up and sit in darkness. I found myself curled up in a ball in the corner, crying like a baby. I couldnapost cook, couldnapost make a cup of tea, I wasnapost eating properly, I had isolated myself massively I would just lie on the sofa for days. The only time I got up was to go to the loo. I just felt so ashamed. In the end I thought, aposThis has just got to stop. I canapost cope with the pain, the emotions coming thick and fast, the memories and the flashbacks all the time.apos I convinced myself that the best thing would be to end my le. I got in the car and drove down the M to Dorset - I was going to drive off a clf - but just as I was turning off the motorway, I got a text from a friend saying, aposRoss are you up for coffee at any point apos It was so random - she hadnapost texted me for weeks beforehand - but that brought me back to reality. I pulled over and stayed in a lay-by for what seemed like hours sobbing before I drove back home.apos It was not the last time Ross, , who lives in Emsworth, Hampshire, tried to kill himself. The other time, I chose a typical male thing, he adds. I donapost know why. Iaposve seen so many hangings and the devastation that causes with the emergency services and family members having to cut someone down. But I knew some nice walks and wooded areas where I wouldnapost be found for a while. I got in my car, had the rope with me and was driving towards my chosen location when I thought, aposWait a minute. Thereaposs got to be more. I shouldnapost be taking my own le because of the effects of work.What a tragedy that would beapos.    PAUL, , saw Ross three times in the study of his £million home in Kensington, west London, treating his anxiety, panic attacks, nightmares and hyper-vigilance with a combination of hypnosis, neuro-linguistic programming and Havening, a psycho-sensory therapy, developed by US neuroscientist Ronald Ruden. The behavioural scientist adopted the technique, which involves touching the sides of the arms, palms of the hands, lateral eye movement and some visualisations, after taking part in a small trial at Kingaposs College, led by Professor Neil Greenberg. I really love doing this work, says Paul. The people Iaposm working with are frankly heroes. Theyaposve put themselves in harmaposs way so that we can all sleep at night or, like with Ross, on the frontlines, helping people in crisis situations with their lives and personally. Is this the cure for PTSD  Certainly itaposs proving a very effective treatment. It is a very straightforward option for most people, with outstandingly good results. The scientic evidence is strong. Havening is backed by the former Field Army Commander, Lieutenant General Sir Graeme Lamb, who said: I have watched with great interest the Havening Technique and been struck by its potential. To me, the impact is real and definitive, and I like and trust both Dr Neil Greenberg and Paul McKenna, who along with Kingaposs College London have been pioneering this work. Rossaposs story shows how mental health problems can affect anyone. The son of a soldier - his father was in the Royal Lancers - he grew up with two brothers and four sisters in a military town in Germany. His parents orced when he was a teenager and he followed his father into the services, joining the Royal Engineers before switching to the RAF as a firefighter.

I am joining millions around the UK and beyond by fasting from dawn until sunset every night for a month, and documenting my experience below as I go. Fasting, or apossawmapos as itaposs known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam. By giving up food, we think about those who are less fortunate than ourselves, and may not know when their next meal will come. But itaposs not just about food, itaposs about being grateful and appreciating all the things you have. For me, it has always been a way to realign myself with my faith every year.Some days I find myself feeling more focused, mindful and at peace. I feel the benefits, I see the purpose of it and I even enjoy it, telling myself I might just fast on random days during the year to ground myself.  But other days I feel I canapost cope, my stomach grumbles, I consider giving up, I feel void of energy and Iaposve had enough. For the next month, Iaposm going to blog my experience to lt the lid on what fasting is really like - see below for my post on Day Four.  Being as honest as I can be, I will write about my highs, my lows and everything in between. Iaposll also aim to answer all those questions youaposve probably never dared ask. To start with a few: No youaposre not allowed to drink water, yes you can brush your teeth, no I donapost believe it is harmful to your healthitaposs done sensibly , no you canapost just eat something and aposnot tell anyoneapos and yes you can swallow your own saliva...

But what I am really struggling with is the lack of caffeine.Like many, I rely on a cup of tea or coffee to give me a boost in the morning to help me work, focus, and perk me up in general.I woke up on Monday, the first day of Ramadan, with a pounding headache and knewI could just have even a sip of coffee it would have been fixed. But alas, I powered through and the pounding head soon disappeared as the day went on. What I’ve also realised is how much we use food and drink for comfort.Filling our bellies is not just about sustenance. Our meals and hot drinks affect us emotionally and give our moods a boost. Without that bit of sugar, or whatever  it is you crave, we have to find inner strength to give us that push.  Something  I’ve done, which I’m not sure I should have, is calculate the number of hours I’m fasting.Using the official dawn and sunset times for London todayI will be fasting for a total of more than  hours.That leaves me with under seven hours to try and fit in three balanced meals and two pints of water while striving for the recommended eight hours sleep - an impossible task. So instead I have to weigh things up and decide what to compromise on - food, water or sleep  Generally I prioritise water as I know how important it is to be hydrated, I try and get in two meals as any more would make me feel sick in such a short space of time, and aim to sleep for six hours, but itaposs certainly a squeeze.   May : Ramadan is imminent and I feel totally unprepared Ramadan begins on Monday, and I feel totally unprepared. The truth is, thereaposs no way to get yourself ready mentally - it seems to just come around really quickly every year and you just have to get on with it. Iaposve written a checklist - or shopping list - of what I need to get beforehand. Dates come top of the list as Muslims break their fast with dates every night. Itaposs a tradition that goes back to the Prophet Mohammed, and the high levels of sugar are a great way to boost your energy having not eaten for hours. Iaposm going to hit Tesco and make sure my fridge is well stocked for the night times. Then Iaposll have a huge feast, drink lots of water and go to bed ready for the challenge to begin.  When is Ramadan  It is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moonis spotted, fasting begins the following day. Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan,the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day. Local sightings of the moon can dfer, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days dferent countries start and end their fast. It moves about  days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. Ramadan can last either  or  days. This year it began on Monday May ."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet message harry whispered meghan","story":"NewsSweet message Harry whispered to Meghan as they revealed baby Archie to worldLip reader Tina Lannin has revealed what the Prince Harry said to Meghan Markle as he took charge of the familys appearance in front of the media in Windsor Castle - and its adorableShareCommentsByAmber Hicks:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video prince-harry-mouths-here-go-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMeghan and Harry have been determined to dance to their own tune with the details they revealed about their son throughout the pregnancy and birth.

Hours earlier, on May , , an express sleeper crashed at mph on our most notorious railway bend. Six died and  were injured, including Colin’s parents. But, incredibly, their seven-month-old son escaped death by inches – with just one scratch on his forehead. Firemen pulled him from the mangled compartment and took him to hospital for a check-up. The following day the Daily Mirror introduced the world to “The Miracle Baby Found In The Train Wreck.”    Now  years old, Colin Garness says: “I count myself incredibly lucky to have survived.” Speaking after we tracked him down half a century later, he adds: “We’d been in a sleeper compartment, dad on the top bunk, mum and me below. During the night I woke crying, and mum moved me to the end of the bed. “She always saidshe hadn’t done that I could have been crushed to death – and she counts her blessings.” The accident, which would prove a landmark in railway safety, happened at around .am as the train from London King’s Cross to Aberdeen sped north through Northumberland.    It all went wrong on the infamous “Morpeth Curve” where the railway line turns back on itself at  degrees – the tightest bend in Britain. Five people were killed when a train derailed there in  and the stretch had a mph limit. On the morning of the  crash The Aberdonian Express entered the curve at more than twice the limit after the driver lost concentration. He braked too late and the  carriages careered off the track.  Two shot up the embankment, another was speared by a section of rail. The Mirror’s report the next day on the “Nightmare on a sleeper express” told how dazed ­passengers escaped. A hero doctor, himself hurt, tended to the injured and dying before collapsing. Eleven fire crews battled to free those who were trapped – including the Garness family. Colin Senior, then , a mechanic in the Fleet Air Arm, and we Jackie, , were ing home to Lossiemouth, Scotland, after taking their son to see Jackie’s parents in Nottingham. Colin Junior, , now lives in Dundee with we Anne and children Emily, , Elizabeth, , and Murray, .  Colin, who works as an operations supervisor on an offshore oil , explains: “I knew about what happened from a very early age, because my parents wanted to tell me how lucky I’d been. “They’d picked up the Aberdonian Express in Grantham, settled into the sleeper compartment and gone off to sleep at about pm. “Suddenly they were upside down and being thrown about. It must have been terrying. “Mum was trapped, but because she had moved me in the night I escaped. Dad broke his shoulder. I don’t know whether it was when he was trying to break the door to get them all out. “Eventually people came and cut a hole in the cabin door and my dad managed to hand me out to them. “I was carried off to a family who lived nearby, who very kindly looked after me until I was taken to hospital to be checked over. I was completely unharmed – just a bump on my head.”  As Colin was rushed to Newcastle upon Tyne, his mum Jackie was still trapped. “She had to be cut out by the fire service,” he says. “She’d injured her back and has suffered back pain as a result.” When Jackie was freed she was loaded into one of  ambulances on scene. Colin’s parents were taken to Ashington Hospital –  miles away from their baby son. Staff reassured them little Colin was doing fine and next morning the Daily Mirror’s front page showed him happily taking a bottle from a nurse. Later that day his dad was well enough to visit him, reporting to Jackie he was “looking chirpy”. It was another  hours before Jackie was reunited with her baby, after two nurses took him to her. And the Mirror was there to capture the moment with our reporter writing: “Jackie cried with relief when he was gently placed beside her on the pillow.” A full inquiry was carried out by Colonel JRH Robertson, Permanent Secretary to the EnvironmentDepartment. He found the driver, Leslie Byers, , solely responsible.He said he failed to brake as he was worrying about a letter from bosses asking him to explain why he was four minutes late on a earlier run. The Colonel wrote: “Driver Byers relaxed his customary concentration and allowed his mind to become distracted.” But he added: “I was much impressed by Driver Byers. “He struck me as a very good type of driver and a careful and conscientious man. He did not seek to excuse himself in any way.” He said the driver had attached too much importance to the routine notice and taken “the implied criticism too much to heart”. In  British Rail began putting floodlit warnings carrying the speed limit well before braking points. They were dubbed “Morpeth boards”.  But technical issues meant they weren’t put on the curve itself until  when a sleeper derailed at the same spot, injuring . Colin says of the report: “I was impressed by how fair it was and how honest the driver had been. Dad doesn’t hold any ill will. He says ‘the guy was under pressure to make up time’. And imagine living with the knowledge your mistake led to six lives lost.” He says of a scrapbook his parents kept about the tragedy: “I used to read it but in my teens I got a bit of ribbing for being ‘The Miracle Baby’. “I didn’t think much about it after that until I showed my we the book. “Then, last week, without having registered the th anniversary, I got it out of the loft for my kids.” Showing them the pictures was tinged with sadness. “Because there are probably still six families affected by the crash. I was just a very lucky baby.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uks most least reliable cars","story":"NewsUKs most and least reliable cars revealed - and its bad news for BMWPeugeot, Skoda and Hyundai reigned supreme in a study of reliability in the auto-industryShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPeugeot was considered the best of the best \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA German car manufacturer famed for its reliability and solid engineering was the shock loser in a study of problematic car features.  BMW was named as the least reliable car following research that looked at how many problems drivers reported with their vehicles.

Niah Selway has such severe reactions that a single drop of water can cause an intense burning all over her body that will last for hours. The -year-old has Aquagenic Pruritus, an allergy that only affects very few people worldwide and has no known cause. The rare condition means that, even though Niahaposs organs are not affected and she can still drink water, liquids cannot come into contact with her skin. And everything from her own tears to sweat and urine can trigger allergic reactions. Niah, from Hastings, East Sussex, has symptoms so intense that she will often fall-asleep from exhaustion after a reaction, and has been left housebound.    Despite being under specialists for nearly four years, medical professionals are yet to find out the cause. Niah, who is known on YouTube as the aposGirl whoaposs allergic to waterapos, said: I am suffering in a really severe way, and no medication or treatment has had any substantial effect. It doesnapost matter where the water touches me,a drop touches my arm the pain will spread to my back and torso, sometimes to my whole body. When I have a bath my whole body burns for hours on end. Over time I worked out a routine, either way itaposs painful but I have found ways to make it a little less traumatic. For instance, I donapost wash my hair in the bath anymore, I do it separately to feel less pain. There are so many things people donapost think about, such as sweat, urine and tears. Sometimes Iaposll have a reaction on my body, Iaposll start crying because of it and have one on my face too. It is basically a disability because of the things I can no longer do.    In the morning I get to the toilet and Iaposll have an allergic reaction to the first thing I do. I also canapost do much exercise apart from yoga and walking because I canapost sweat, and on hot days Iaposll have to be stuck in front of the fan. My day is working around my pain. Niah experienced her first reactions at the age of five, with them worsening through puberty and finally peaking over the last couple of years. She said: Initially it would happen about every ten showers. The doctors werenapost showing any concern for it, so I thought maybe I am just not good at dealing with pain. Then in my teens it became every single shower or bath, and it got to the point where I wasnapost able to ignore it. Niahaposs extreme symptoms have left her unable to carry out basic daily activities and aposbaffledapos doctors. She added: Most people with Aquagenic Pruritus seem to find some sort of cure or treatment, whereas for me nothing has worked.    Itaposs dficult to see someone  find relief while it just wonapost work on you. Towards the beginning of , Niah came to the realisation that her illness would not allow her to lead a normal le. She credits her strength to her parents Bob and Antonia and boyfriend Mark.

Niah said: I stopped focusing on whataposs going to happen, and try to make now as positive as it can be. My family have been amazing, even in little things, like doing the dishes. They just take all water-related responsibilities away from me, and they have adapted their lives around mine. I always worried when my condition got bad that my friends would leave me because I couldnapost do stuff with them, like going out and clubbing. But they are amazing, they are really understanding and make any effort to try and see me. Niah, who works at an insurance company, has been forced to take time off her job due to her condition.

The carer for the little one said itaposs like sheaposs storing calories in case she needs them in the future. The child was fed a diet relying on oats and rice milk during the first  months of her le which seriously damaged her growth. Her parents,  and , fed the girl a diet so lacking in basic nutrients she developed rickets - a degenerative bone disease caused by a shortage of vital nutrients. Details of the neglect of the Australian toddler were heard at Sydneyaposs Downing Centre District Court on Thursday during a sentencing hearing for her parents.    The child, who is now three, had no medical records the hearing was told and neighbours did not even know she existed. The vegan parents have admitted to failing to provide for their child, causing her serious injury. Neighbours had seen the girlaposs two older brothers, Nine News reports , but they did not know the couple had a third child. The authorities were only alerted to the girlaposs very existence when she had a seizure at the family home in Sydney. The tot then stayed in hospital for a month. A victim impact statement written by a foster carer on the childaposs behalf revealed the extent of her malnourishment. It read: For the first  months of her her ledid not receive the basic care to grow and develop,apos the carer said in her statement.   was defenceless and unable to protect herself from her parents. At the age of  months the toddler weighed less than kgand looked like a three-month-old. The child, who had no teeth, could not sit up or even roll over, let alone use her hands for simple tasks such as playing with toys. aposCaring forwas like caring for a very young baby,apos the carer said. The child, now almost three, had made progress but her height and weight were out of proportion. The gains have not come easily, the carer said. This crime has had a long-term impact on her development. The girl could now crawl, stand and walk and spoke about  words.    She had developed a healthy appetite but her short stature meant she was obese. Itaposs like her body is storing calories in case she needs them in the future, the carer said. She immediately stands out as dferent from other children. When the toddler was admitted to hospital the mother told a dietician her entire family followed a vegan diet. She said her daughter would generally have one cup of oats with rice milk and half a banana in the morning, and a piece of toast with jam or peanut butter for lunch.    For dinner, she said her daughter would be offered tofu, rice or potatoes. But she said the girl, who was also breastfed once a day, was a aposfussy eaterapos so she might just have oats again. This diet resulted in severe deficiencies in nutrients for the infant, including a lack of calcium, phosphate, vitamin B, vitamin A, iron and zinc. Her levels of vitamin D - which can cause bone diseasefound to be too low - were aposundetectableapos. The infant had fractures throughout her tiny body and her bones were so brittle doctors believed they could have been broken by aposnormal handlingapos. The girl now lives with a relative and her two brothers in another state. The sentencing hearing continues.

Unfortunately it wasn’t to be and it ended up being a bit of a crazy game in the end.“It is quite a young team at Aberdeen and that experienceis something they will % learn from and take forward in their career.“I am sure a lot of them will have those chances again.“Hopefully next season they will go one better and hopefully get to the final and win some silverware.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/Maggie2-940x529.jpg ","title":"aberdeen charity lifeline gets maggie back on feet","story":"A woman has spoken of the “leline” service a social charity has provided in helping her manage her mental health.Maggie was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been in Cornhill Hospital before moving to VSA’s St Aubins, a rehabilitation service for adults over the age of  with a mental health illness.With VSA’s support, she has been able to transition back into the community.Maggie was delighted to move into St Aubins.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas arrives at loch fyne sea angling club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAfter a series of weather related cancellations, Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club finally held its Christmas and combined league outing on Saturday February .While conditions were challenging on Loch Etive, it proved to be a fun day.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures. Six young people and two leaders are travelling to Malaysia to undertake community projects in a remote northern village and two Explorers will participate in the th World Scout Jamboree in the USA.He continued: #We are sad that our Beaver leader Eli is leaving us for pastures new.

In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor   Cybernats    and extremists represent the worst of times","story":"Written in , harking back to Francersquos Reign of Terror, it is also a sobering reminder of what can happen when nuance is removed from public discourse. And unfortunately, dear reader, there is much to worry about these days on that score.Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsNowhere do we see it more than on social media. With this in mind, I applaud unequivocal attempts by prominent SNP figures, as outlined in yesterdayrsquos Herald, to denounce the online abuse spat out by some on their side of the constitutional debate, not just at opponents of independence, but anyone who dares say or tweet something, no matter how innocuous, that doesnrsquot chime entirely with their world view. Describing such keyboard warriors as ldquoweird, ldquocreepy, ldquopoisonous, ldquovicious ldquocowards, former party deputy Angus Robertson, MP Stewart McDonald and MEP Alyn Smith are absolutely right to point out that such trolling, bullying and harassment ndash much of it aimed specically at women ndash is not only out of order, but ultimately damaging to the cause they support.If anyone is in any doubt about the form this sort of intimidation takes, you need only look at last weekrsquos bullying of BBC Scotland journalist Emma Clford Bell. Researching a piece about Dundeersquos reaction to Nicolarsquos Sturgeonrsquos announcement on a possible second independence referendum, she did her job and appealed on social media for a pro-Union voice to appear among a ldquoiety of opinions ndash including pro-independence supporters ndash to be featured in the package. What followed was a pile-on of epic and bizarre proportions, as hundreds jumped on the bandwagon and accused her of bias, told her to ldquof*** off , that she was ldquoscum, a ldquoclown of a lassie and a ldquostupid bint.Primarily, this is a very personal ndash not to mention sexist ndash attack on Ms Clford Bell. But it also represents a worrying and increasingly common assault on the act and process of journalism itself, a wilful misunderstanding of what journalists do, a knowing conflation of news and comment, a perpetuation of the warped idea that ldquogood journalism is what I agree with, and ldquobad journalism is everything .Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsMore than anything, it reflects a worrying lack of critical thinking. Indeed, some of the responses to those who criticised the bad behaviour are as grim as the initial attack blaming the victim, whatabouteryand reeling off old complaints about BBC presenters only makes it worse. Whorsquod want to share a movement, let alone a country ndash independent or not ndash with these people Ms Clford Bellrsquos experience is a depressing sign of the times that reflects a more general willingness to trade critical thinking for the ease of conspiracy theories, righteous anger, having a , and a sense of identity and community, eventhe latter is based on nothing more than the precarious idea of a shared enemy.At the same time, the power and reach of social media also attracts those looking to monetise certain views, not to mention nefarious organisations and even foreign states whose main aim is to stir up trouble. And since the current system encourages anonymity and duplicity, it can be hard to work out who or what is even real.The so-called lsquoCybernatsrsquo exist in a relatively tiny corner of social media, of course, their vitriol matched by those shouting about other extreme world views, most notably ldquoBrit Nats, Hard Brexiteers, Trump supporters and white supremacists.Theyrsquore all equally unsavoury, flourishing by using OTT, hysterical narratives to pinpoint and frame their attacks, often choosing to personally abuse the target in the process humiliate, intimidate and crush.Since they shout so loud, the lsquoCybernatsrsquo often succeed in getting the attention they crave, which in turn exaggerates how representative their views are within the Yes movement, thus turning off more moderate supporters and potential new recruits to the cause.Depressingly, thatrsquos why I think it will be so dficult for Messrs Robertson, McDonald and Smith to change anything. The attack dogs do so knowingly, in order to deliberately provoke attention, or are so far down the unthinking zealot road as to be beyond reach. What both have in common is that the more they insult, the easier it becomes.Such abuse has nothingto do with independence per se, but the damage for the wider Yes movement will be harder to disassociate.The appeal for nuance and persuasion comes at a time when both seem out of fashion, while extreme language pulses and trends through our discourse.Those of us looking for comfort should perhaps turn back to Dickens.

It lacks \"big thinking\", she says, and has lost the untidy energy that characterised its early days.But its not just Holyrood that has lost its ambition ndash its the institutions and bodies around it.A third sector that was previously bursting with ideas and determination now fears to speak out in case its funding is stripped away by vengeful ministers.ldquoI personally think the third sector, in particular, has been very conditioned in a way that they werenrsquot then,\" Ms Lamont says.ldquoI think therersquos a lot of people, who are all really good people ndash their ambition is less.ldquoBecause they donrsquot want to fall out, so actually they ask for what they think theyrsquoll get.ldquoI think whats happening now [is] worthy of an investigation by somebody, somewhere,people are willing to speak about it.ldquoThird sector organisations are reminded where their funding comes from, and so they donrsquot really push as hard as they might have done in the past.ldquoAnd actually also, people have accepted that Government backbenchers are not going to rebel. So they donrsquot even put them under pressure.She adds: ldquoObviously the SNP are in power. It may have happened anyway.The MSP says there is an attitude among charities and other organisations of \" I go out on a limb here, and say something really dficult, there will be consequences in terms of my funding. So I will not be able to do that again.\"In the early years of Holyrood, there was always a chance the biggest party would lose out at the next election. But with the dominance of the SNP, \"you have to accommodate yourself with that realityyou rely on the funding and things like that\".The quality of political debate has also been hit. Most debates now, Ms Lamont says, are simply a proxy for something  - namely, the ongoing constitutional battle over independence.Meanwhile, there is an \"unhealthy\" dynamic that sees ministers rarely fielding questions from their own side, while the co-operative spirit Holyrood was meant to foster hasnt quite survived contact with reality.ldquoI always thought there was a slight naivety about this idea thatyou put people in a circle and say itrsquos a more [representative] parliament, theyre somehow more likely to agree with each other,\" Ms Lamont says.\"I donrsquot think so. I think itrsquos actually in some ways more tribal. But itrsquos not tribal around policy mdash itrsquos tribal around what itrsquos a proxy for.She says the balance between the executive and parliament has changed over the years, with almost half of the current SNP group holding ministerial posts.The former Scottish Labour leader advocates a more \"mature\", cross-party approach. This could see Green MSPs, who helped vote through the minority SNP Governments Budget earlier this year, drafted in as ministers.ldquoIf they stuck somebody like Andy Wightman in to do land reform, into their Cabinet, that would be quite a good trade-off against other things that the Greens might not be able to do,\" she says.But amid the disappointments, there have been plenty of good times.Ms Lamont looks back fondly on those early days, when anything seemed possible and friendships were forged \"in that sense of being under siege\".ldquoI mean, it was really good fun,\" she says. \"It was hilarious. I look back with a lot of sadness.ldquoIf yoursquore anywhere for  years, therersquos things that have happened in your own le.ldquoI lost my mother in .

Theyrsquove kind of formed their character, theyrsquove got good values, theyrsquore pushing out there and beginning to understand what they want out of le.ldquoI would think the Scottish Parliament needs to get to that point, and the sooner the better.\"Because therersquos so many really good things that it has done, and so many good things it can do, and so much resource that can be applied in a dferent way."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-wallace-gains-outweigh-the-mistakes-in-scottish-parliaments-first-two-decades","story":"It was an arresting thought. Now, as we look back over  years to the first Scottish Parliamentary election, it is surely unthinkable that we should ever turn the clock back. And in an age when politicians and political institutions are regularly under attack, perhaps one of the most signicant achievements is that our Parliament is so embedded in Scotlandrsquos political landscape.Its achievements go much further than that. One doesnrsquot have to have approved of all the legislation passed since , but the legislative record of the Parliament is impressive compared to what would have been achievedWestminster had continued to find time for only one or two Scottish measures in a year.Within weeks, the new Parliament had passed the Mental Health Act to plug a signicant legal loophole. It undertook long overdue legislation on land reform. It implemented a host of outstanding Scottish Law Commission proposals.We created National Parks. We opened new railway lines. We provided a Freedom of Information regime, more open and robust than applies to UK public bodies.We led the way in the UK in effecting a ban on smoking in public places. Scotland continues to lead the way in promoting a presumption against very short prison sentences.Moreover, the experience of many who seek to lobby or simply have their voices heard, is that government, ministers and officials, are much closer and more accessible.I recall a visit to Barcelona in the early s, when Scotlandrsquos business community was generally still hostile to any kind of devolution. Something may have been gained in the translation, but our Catalan business hosts said that one of their perceived advantages of devolved government was that ldquothe bums were closer to kick. Many Scottish Ministers over the last  years may attest to that.Notwithstanding achievements, from the Parliamentrsquos earliest days, we had to cope with brickbats and criticism. Perhaps we oversold what could be achieved ndash or at least the time it would take to make a dference. The reality was that neither the Parliament nor the Government took over full legislative and executive powers until st July ndash almost two months after the election.During that time, we scored own goals like minting medals, but some housekeeping was essential. Without fixing allowances, our staff couldnrsquot be paid. But the perception was one of self-serving MSPs, no better than their Westminster counterparts. And the building project dogged us for at least five years, even although the plan and contract had been inherited from Westminster.One of the early controversies was the decision to repeal ldquosection A, which forbade teaching of homosexuality in schools. Having been in the Commons when this particularly pernicious piece of legislation was originally passed, I had no doubt that it was right to end it. But repeal had not been mentioned in either coalition partyrsquos manesto, and the announcement without preparing the ground, nor engaging in prior consultation broke our own rules about the importance of consultation in policy making.Some might argue that in other policy areas, there was too much consultation, which made politics boring but on an issue such as the right of responsible access to land, I believe that extensive discussion with interested parties brought about a well- balanced piece of legislation, which has stood the test of time.I firmly believed that Parliamentrsquos Committees had a crucial role to play, both in holding Ministers to account and in scrutinising legislation. My experience in the first years of the Parliament was that Committees were influential and effective. I had to bring in a Bill to add a religion question to the  Census, after the Equal Opportunities Committeeturned me over when I tried to defend a cabinet decision not to include such a question. My perception, and what I hear from current Parliamentarians, is that the SNPrsquos well acclaimed discipline has robbed Committees of much of their robustness in challenging the administration. Going forward, it is to be hoped that Committees will rediscover their earlier zeal for effective scrutiny.Looking back  years, I recall an election campaign where we discussed issues of everyday importance to Scotlandrsquos people over a wide range of important domestic areas, where the new Parliament had powers. It was a refreshing change from the many general elections Irsquod fought, where the constitutional question dominated, evenit wasnrsquot ranked high in polls identying votersrsquo concerns. Regrettably, more recent election campaigns have reverted to debates about our constitutional future ndash and Irsquom not holding my breath that  will be any dferent.This is regrettable. By comparison with many devolved Parliaments and even states in federal countries, the powers of the Scottish Parliament are extensive, having been considerably added to since .

A week and a half ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used her speech at the SNP conference to declare a ldquoclimate emergency. This followed meetings with young climate change campaigners who had gone on strike from school to get across the message that adults were ruining the planet. Scotland was already a world leader in tackling climate change, said the FM, and having announced an emergency she pledged that Scotland would live up to its responsibility to tackle it.Act now or risk devastationThis week, in what was punted as a measure of her dedication, she dumped a manesto commitment to cut air passenger duty. Straight into the grey bin it went, no plans to recycle. Farewell concerns about Scotlandrsquos connectivity to the rest of the UK and the world. Ta-ta to boosting tourism and exports, and all those other benefits the party had argued would follow the tax cut.As of yesterday morning, the SNPrsquos website continued to state that ldquoUK Air Passenger Dutyis one of the most expensive taxes of its kind in the world and hampers Scotlandrsquos ability to secure new direct international routes and maintain existing ones. Indeed, the level of taxation on the tourism sector, taking account of both VAT and APD, is amongst the highest in the world. This relatively high burden of taxation restricts the potential of the sector to grow to attract many more visitors to Scotland.Greens: The positive way to fight climate changeBut forget all that. As Derek Mackay, the Finance Secretary, told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, cutting the tax ldquois no longer compatible with more ambitious climate targets. So yoursquoll have had your cheaper holidays and the chance to turbo charge the economy.Business is angry about the sudden U-turn on a policy that has been in place for eight years. Liz Cameron, director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said the move would do nothing to reduce emissions. Others have asked why,the government is so keen to tackle climate change, it is spending pound million to keep Prestwick airport open. Glasgow Prestwick Airport.It is no use complaining, however. As Roseanna Cunningham, the Environment Secretary, pointed out,everyone is in agreement that the planet is facing a climate emergency then politicians must act in the national and international interest, ldquoand not just what suits party political purposes.How magnanimous. How fortunate, moreover, that this reinvigorated dedication to the cause comes in a parliament where support of the Greens is vital in passing the administrationrsquos budget and other measures.But again, who are we to quibble  Itrsquos an emergency. We are at war with the clock in trying to make good the damage caused by centuries of pillaging the Earthrsquos resources. Someone has to pay, so it is us, in the here and now. Shut up and eat your green policies.No one would deny that there is a need to change our ways, but you do wonderwe have thought through the costs and impact and whether they are being imposed fairly.

Look at what is already happening on the roads. Like a lot of other people, I would like to cycle rather than drive. Yet when you see the antagonism between cyclists and drivers it does not seem worth the risk.From this week, in response to the number of cyclists injured, undercover police are to take to bikes to enforce the rules on overtaking. Those who drive too close and are caught face three penalty points on their licence. A reasonable enough response to such thoughtless actions.But thoughtlessness is not the sole preserve of drivers. It is not unusual to see cyclists travelling in packs that are dficult to pass, causing frustration among motorists. On my way into work there is a stretch of road that includes dedicated cycle lanes. It cost a small fortune to create them, and the disruption caused lasted for months, yet a lot of cyclists will not use them. Then there are the bikes on pavements, the cyclists who jump traffic lights and the ones, albeit a minority, who seem to see it as their duty to be aggressive.Clock is ticking nowSelfish and dangerous behaviour on the part of cyclists and drivers should not happen, and it wouldnrsquotthe system of give and take, of compromise, was working as it should. But one side feels penalised by the other. The more people feel green policies are an imposition on particular groups, rather than something that benefits us all, the more ision will occur.In such sensitive times it does not help for policymakers to so blatantly play politics with environmental matters, as has happened with the air tax cut U-turn.

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new day comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Prospect had previously called off a day’s strike on April  to allow the company to develop new proposals. As no new offer has been made and with no further talks scheduled the union has said an offer is not likely to be tabled.Notably, the new strike date is also the first day of the Orkney Folk Festival, which welcomes acts and visitors to the county from all over the world.David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Members have run out of patience with HIAL. Talks have been ongoing for more than a year to seek to resolve this dispute but to no avail. Prospect agreed to withdraw our strike action in April to allow further talks to take place and members trusted that HIAL would use that time to bring forward proposals to resolve the dispute — HIAL have abused that trust.“Members do not want to take industrial action but have been left with no choice. If they want to prevent disruption across the highlands on May  and throughout the summer then Scottish Ministers need to intervene.”Responding, Highlands and Islands Airport Limitedmanaging director Inglis Lyon said they were #bitterly disappointed# and vowed to minimise any potential disruption wherever possible.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s a large stone cross marking Flora MacDonald’s grave, known, of course, for assisting the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie, although comparably little is known for certain about her own le, and her motivations have been interpreted in dfering ways.The stone, it is said paid for by public donations, looms huge and solidly, staking its claim to a bit of horizon as waves roll in the background. Far from most tourist hot spots, it is situated in Kilmuir Cemetery near the Trotternish Peninsula. It’s remote enough for visitors to starkly appreciate the wildness of Scottish nature at its most bold, and our inidual smallness next to battering wind, roaring sea, and historical legend assaulting the senses all at once.But it feels poignant not only for the setting or the story, but because it is a monument to a woman. Many monuments have prestige quite often they’ve been designed to demonstrate the wealth of traders and patrons. Not all have the same power to inspire, or come anywhere near it.The ability to evoke shivers comes from this comparative rarity it feels not only a monument to MacDonald but a reminder that, often as quietly and remotely as the setting of this marker, the women of Scotland have also shaped history.: Alternative map of Scotland renames famous landmarks after notable womenAuthor Sara Sheridan’s new book, Where are the Women  reimagines a Scotland where plentul monuments, streets and natural wonders take the names of women. Look up a part of Scotland and it will tell you of local women who achieved remarkable things in art, science, social movements and professional fields, those who played a role in history in other ways, or who were persecuted as witches. Almost none of them have a monument in their honour Sheridan has imagined strolling dedicated walkways, observing plaques, and looking upon celebratory fountains.“Follow the bronze arrows to see women who influenced the area and indeed the world.” If we followed the author’s directions, we could come across, for example, a walkway in Glasgow Green culminating in Maggie Moffat, one of the earliest Scottish Suffragettes to be incarcerated, or a window in Dundee’s St Paul’s Cathedral depicting Margaret Blackwood, founder of Disability Income Group Scotland. Women achieving would be visible everywhere, built into the world around us. Isn’t that a powerful thought It’s a great bit of research, spanning centuries of poor archiving and relegation to footnotes and asides. I’ll consult it whenever I travel around the country, to note who came before and what they did, imprinting their lives onto spaces that have kept no visible trace of them. It’s moving to consider how it would feel were Sheridan’s imaginary monuments real, and modern citizens habitually moved among not only physical reminders of historic acts but the very idea itself that excellence takes the form of women.: Scotland’s forgotten women deserve a place in history – Brian FergusonStatues are a monument to genuine achievement in many cases and great inventions have come in eras women were socially dissuaded or literally barred from pursuing professions. At other times, men considered great have stood on others’ shoulders. Wealthy merchants profiting from the slave trade loom large in landmark buildings. Few poor men – or women – have statues dedicated to them, unless you consider clusters of unnamed soldiers representing war dead. The average person probably couldn’t tell you the names, far less the stories, of very many statues dotted around their town. For most of us they are sleeping sculptural giants we walk right past. I haven’t always felt that campaigns to build new statues are the best focus of feminist energy, but replicating the image of men across our grandest squares and parks has contributed to our cultural ideas about who is taken seriously. We have placed our collective esteem in the image of man, dedicated totems, and rewarded with the enduring honour of names strewn across our maps. One might think, from walking around, that no women live here, far less have achieved anything.In the notes, Sheridan describes her research process, coming across book after book repeating the same stories of men. There are hidden accomplishments in every city and town we walk through. Efforts like Sheridan’s help draw Scotland’s women out of historical invisibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why deposit return scheme for cans and bottles should be win win leader comment","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.It has always been a scandal that we have thrown away vast quantities of a valuable material like aluminium in particular. And it will be an even greater scandalwe fail to take such steps to reduce the amount of waste plastic getting into the natural world, given we have belatedly realised just how much damage it is causing.While Scotland is set to become the first part of the UK to introduce the scheme, similar ones have been operating around the world for some time. And indeed many people will remember the days when there was a deposit on glass bottles in the UK. So there is no reason why we cannot make deposits work now and a number of reasons why we should do so.: Green groups and businesses clash over Scottish bottle depositschemeAnnouncing the Scottish Government’s intention to put legislation before MSPs, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham rightly cited the “global climate emergency” as one reason.But waste in any form is an inefficiency and there are economic benefits to be made from recycling valuable and useful materials. It has even been suggested recently that rubbish dumps could be mined for some of the materials they contain, so wasteful have we been.There is a general acceptance by the public of the need to recycle and a financial incentive – coupled with better facilities – will make a dference. It really should be a ‘win-win’ for all concerned and the sooner it is introduced, the better.: Scotland’s deposit- system: how it will workHowever, the one potential problem is the requirement for retailers todeposits to shoppers and deal with the used cans and bottles. The Scottish Retail Consortium warned the inclusion of glass in the scheme would be “an enormous burden”, particularly for small shops. High street retailers have been having a tough time of late and should not be made to pay a price for this scheme. Indeed it could be an opportunity to help them. After all,they are providing a service, could they not be given some form of payment for that  Reverse vending machines are used effectively in places like Germany and could simply the process considerably.Huge structural changes to our economy are underway as part of what is being called a new industrial revolution.

The decision to ‘democratise the Games’ was taken on Sunday at the SHGA half-yearly meeting in Braemar following a discussion with Event Scotland which can provide up to  per cent of funding.SHGA has now asked its members to run athletic events on either a handicap basis or to have separate events for men and women. It is also creating a number of new leagues for women, so that at the end of the season athletes competing regularly will get rewarded with cash prizes and trophies, the same as men.Launching the new policy, Ian Grieve, SHGA secretary, said: “Talking to people and looking at what was in the press, we found that there wasn’t a good awareness of what Highland games can offer female athletes, and there was more we can do to help that situation.“We get lots of male and only some female competitors, but would like to see a lot more.”Mr Grieve said his organisation had contacted over  athletic clubs across Scotland to make athletes aware of the changes, as well as printing and distributing , calendars of events and have listed details on their website.Mr Grieve added: “The aim of all this is to raise the number of female athletes at the Highland games,they come along they will be made very welcome.”Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands, who campaigned for changes to make the Games more erse and inclusive, said: “I am very pleased to hear this news from the SHGA. “Obviously it is disappointing that it took this long for them to get to this point, but the SHGA have now seen sense to join the rest of us in the st century and allow women to compete on a level playing field at Highland Games events.“With growing levels of inactivity and obesity in the country, any chance to encourage participation in sports should be promoted, as well as the huge boost Highland Games give to the economy of many of our remote and rural areas. “To exclude women would be just another hurdle that women in sport have to face.“The Highland Games are something that draws in many tourists from around the world and I am glad that this year we will have a positive message about women in sport.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc lacked in depth knowledge during independence referendum claims former staffer","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A journalist who worked at the BBC has claimed that the corporation had an inherent #lack of sympathy# for Scottish independence and a #lack of in-depth knowledge# about the country during the  referendum.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

If anyone wants to come along, they are very welcome.“We raise any housing issues with Newington Housing Association and have a place on the Girdwood community forum.“We also set up a neighbourhood watch scheme which has become quite important to ensure the local community is a safer place for all.“We also run a number of events throughout the year including a family fun day to raise money for the children’s cancer unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital.”More recently, TDK Community Group have set up a food bank to provide a vital leline for the local community.The food bank operates from a Portakabin at the back of the Duncairn Centre for Culture and Arts every Monday and Wednesday from am to pm.The service is entirely run by volunteers from the TDK area with help from Rev Karen Sethuraman from Soul Space, who are also based in the Duncairn Centre.Rosemary is hoping the food bank will provide much-needed support to those in need in the local community.“The Duncairn kindly provided us with a portacabin and together with volunteers we done up and painted.“We felt there was a great need in the local community for a food bank, particularly with so many people getting disqualied for benefits and universal credit.“We found many people were running low on money each month. The price of food is getting more expensive, so the food bank is a vital resource for some.“The food bank is entirely volunteer-led and without them we could not provide the service.“The support from the local community has been absolutely fabulous. If anyone would like to donate items, please call in and help.”Rev Karen Sethuraman added, “We are a Celtic community and we want to help the community in every way we can.“We want to empower people so the food bank came about after contact with TDK Community Group.“We can support people who come in to use the food bank from food needs or pastoral care needs.”To find out more about TDK Community Group and to get involved, check out the group’s Facebook page"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lace up for daithi on divis mountain this sunday","story":"THE call has gone out to runners and walkers of all ages and abilities to lace up for the Black Mountain k k in aid of West Belfast’s DonateDáithí organ donation campaign.As part of Feile na gCloigíní Gorma, those taking part are asked to meet at am at Divis Mountain carpark where the event will set off, taking in the Trigonometry Point, Ridge Trail and Hatchet Field before finishing at Caulfields bar.A familiar face to many, little Dáithí and his parents Seph and Máirtín will be cheering all those taking part on come Sunday morning.“Last year the run was promoting the services and help offered from a mental health charity and this year we are delighted that as part of Féile na gCloigíní Gorma and Cumann Spoirt an Phobail they have chosen DonateDáithí and organ donation,” explained Máirtín.“We are so happy to hear and to see that the run will be dedicated to Dáithí in this way,” he said.“What we have found in the last few weeks is that there won’t be a Dáithí in every area, there are about  families in the whole of Ireland and the UK who are going through what we are so it’s quite unique.

That means that  per cent of the most affordable homes are no longer available in West Belfast.”Cllr Corr continued: “The reality for us and for many many people in West Belfast who are looking for a home is the massive dference in rents between the Housing Executive houses and housing association houses,” he said.Cllr Corr said he has had numerous tenants seeking advice over their current housing association rents and that the monetary dference between that and a Housing Executive tenancy agreement could be between £ and £ per week.“Rents are decided by a housing association board, whose homes are part-funded by the Department for Communitiesbut who also need to repay loans taken out for house construction, while the Housing Executive is a totally dferent set up.“What you are finding is that housing associations are pricing out working families, especially people on low paid income who cannot afford their rents.“People are stuck. In extreme cases people have had to give up their tenancies and go back to live with their parents in what is now being referred to as the ‘boomerang generation’.“We need a radical overhaul, to increase massively the amount of affordable housing, and we need to have housing-led regeneration for many disadvantaged areas.“People who are working are forced into private rental as they can’t get a mortgage. If you can’t get a mortgage in West Belfast you are forced to look to Glenavy, Crumlin or Lisburn. People are having to leave their family support network, which in turn puts more pressure on those trying to access childcare and schools.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Experience tells us that there is still a long way to go, but this seems to be an important step forward in finally resolving this issue.\"Stephen Elliott is chairman of the Parental Alliance for Choice in Education, which strongly backs the AQE test.\"This is indefensible and it should trouble parents,\" he said.\"Its been a project for the Department of Education - they want to get headmasters to decide this.\"Its remarkable that public sector employees, such as the heads of grammar schools, are interfering in private companies. I think its impossible to combine these tests - theyre trying to measure dferent things. Theyre trying to make the AQE test less reliable. AQE provides parents with past papers, but this would no longer be an option.\"Weve had  years of AQE tests that have essentially been flawless. If its not broke, you dont need to fix it.\"In June last year concerns were also raised by the AQEs chief examiner at the time, Dr Hugh Morrison.Having designed the AQE test and worked free of charge for  years, he said he was \"shocked\" when the consultation was announced. He added at the time he had been given reassurances from both organisations he would be included in any dialogue."},{"url":null,"title":"greens vow to be tough on brexit and its causes at eu election campaign launch","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

open in Dublin..pushThe Virgin Mary, in Dublin’s Capel Street, will open on Thursday with an extensive list of cocktails, wine, beers and spirits, all with zero alcohol content.Owner Vaughan Yates says there is an untapped market in the Irish capital for those who are mindful of their alcohol intake, or completely tee-total.The Virgin Mary, which will operate bar licensing hours from pm to pm, is located near to Ireland’s International Financial Services Centre.Some of Ireland’s capital has seen a marked re-birth since bouncing back from the recession, and Mr Yates is banking on a new type of night-reveller who may want to have a night out “but still be able to go to yoga in the morning”.“The idea behind it was to create an environment where people can come to that is a bar, but simply has no alcohol,” he said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Virgin Mary bar, the first alcohol-free bar to open in Dublin, Ireland “We don’t want to be seen as a coffee shop, we are a bar, which is why we chose the licensing hours, and we don’t serve food.“I think the timing is right because I believe there has been a cultural sht from people towards alcohol, their moderation of alcohol and what they’re consuming.“Lower or no-ABV drinks mean people can have a longer night out, have good conversation and drive home when it’s over.“We’re offering the ultimate responsible night out.“We think we’ll compliment the other bars around here, we don’t necessarily see ourselves as competition, we know that people will continue to drink, that’s a fact of Irish le, but people are a lot more mindful about what they’re consuming and we’re offering a place for that.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A general view of distillates in The Virgin Mary bar The drink prices range from . euro for tonic water to eight euro for a cocktail, and Mr Yates says that as more large distilleries and breweries continue their investment in alcohol-free products, he believes more and more bars will offer low or no alcohol drinks.The announcement of an alcohol-free bar in a city famed for its drinking culture has raised eyebrows among the general public, and Mr Yates says he has encountered his fair share of doubters.“To the doubters, and there are plenty, they laugh when I tell them I’m opening an alcohol-free bar in Dublin, but some have come back to me and said: ‘You know I think you might be on to something, I don’t drink as much as I used to’, so I would like to prove all the doubters wrong and have a venue here that peopleto and we’re here for a long time.“I also hope it’s the start of something bigger, I think in  years time there will be a lot of venues like this.”"},{"url":null,"title":"retailer zavvi apologises for champions league prize email glitch","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC

And, she also hit out at both Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill.Speaking to Channel ’s Alex Thomson Sara Canning said: “It’s been three weeks. I’ve not come to terms with it. I still expect to hear from her every morning. I expect to wake up beside her, and I don’t. You know …“The phone was out she was clicking away, she was texting, she was ringing. She’d gone into reporter mode.“We were only there in total eight minutes. That’s what the police have told us, from the minute we arrived, to the minute it happened, it’s eight minutes.“Well, initially, I… Lyra was clumsy, and I thought she’d tripped over her own feet… and I looked down, and I knew straight away that she hadn’t tripped. And then I noticed that she had a head wound and I put my hand to it and I started screaming for help.”Asked what message she had for those behind the murder Sara added: “It was so indiscriminate.“There was no regard for human le. Why are we protecting that  Andit is your child, I would be ashamed to have a child that had done that. I’d be ashamed.“They took away an amazing person. I’ve lost the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my le with. I was supposed to get engaged today in Central Park. We’d planned the rest of our lives together and in one split second some idiot with a gun took that away.“And then the mealy-mouthed apologies and back-tracking and absolutely pathetic statements that were issued by Saoradh the New IRA.“You can’t apologise for killing someone. You can’t call it an accidental shooting. You fire a gun at a crowd, that’s not an accidental shooting. You’re aiming to shoot someone. I mean, it’s ridiculous. They’re not defending anyone. They’re literally a scourge on their communities. They’re a scourge. They are a scourge.“What I would say is, and this might be heavy-handed, and people might speak out against it or whatever. But I don’t really care – they are grooming young men and women.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“They’re no better, they speak out about paedophile gangs, but they’re no better than paedophiles. They literally take young people who are disenfranchised at the best of times, who are living in poverty, who don’t see a future for themselves in Northern Ireland because there is literally very little here for them. And they tell them that the way forward is a gun in their hand. The way forward is never a gun in your hand.”Sara Canning also revealed what she told politicians who attended Lyra’s funeral in St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast by saying: “At that stage I had looked at who was in the room and I kind of saw red a little bit. So when I was speaking to Leo Varadkar, and I said you need to facilitate these people sitting down at a table.“And so I’m putting my trust in you – you’re a world leader, and you have a presence here. You need to use it for good.“So when I turned from Leo Varadkar, it was Karen Bradley, Secretary of State. Karen Bradley offered her condolences and I accepted them graciously. And I wasn’t rude. But I did tell her that she was doing a pretty terrible job as the Secretary of State. Her lack of knowledge around Northern Ireland was appalling. She needed to go and educate herself. How on earth she had taken a job where she had no knowledge of the area.“She was very gracious I have to say. She nodded and she agreed with me that she had said things that were completely misguided and that she’s gone and educated herself.“As a Derry woman, I had to say to her, to offer your condolences on Lyra when you have turned around and said that soldiers who indiscriminately opened fire in the Bogside on Bloody Sunday were doing their job in a dignied manner. I said they are no dferent to the thug that opened fire in Creggan on Holy Thursday and shot Lyra.”The young Derry woman also spoke to Theresa May at the funeral and recalled what she said to the Prime Minister: “So I basically told her that she was massively derelict in her duties to Northern Ireland and successive governments have [been]. It’s not just been the Tory government. To tell us that issues like gay marriage and abortion rights are a devolved matter is completely out of order. We’re not a devolved state anymore. We’re completely unsuccessful. It has been shown that we can’t work together –so the British government has to be our government. And they have to be our voice and they have to do better. So, that was basically the message that I left with the Prime Minister.”The words of Fr Martin McGill inside St Anne’s Cathedral reverberated around the world when he rebuked politicians in Northern Ireland for failing to talk to each other in order to revive Stormont.“I was the first on my feet. I think. I’m pretty certain I was the first on my feet. And when I applauded, I stood up and I turned my entire body, and I looked to the seats to my right. And I looked at the politicians sitting there.“What I want is, the leaders of the parties, they want broadly the same things. There are red lines and I think we need to look beyond red lines at the minute. Same sex marriage and an Irish language act are important. They are important don’t get me wrong but what’s more important is having a working government who are doing what’s right for the people of Northern Ireland. Because we are, we’ve been left adrt. There’s people missing out on operations and there’s schools missing out on funding. There’s head teachers having to go out and buy toilet roll for their primary schools, because they don’t have the funds to do that,” Sara Canning said.Finally, Sara revealed Lyra’s plans to propose marriage to her and said: ““She had planned a really elaborate proposal at a lake house, on the lake in Central Park. Which one of her best friends Ky has helped her plan.“They had a pdf file and everything. They’d gone, [into] really minute detail. It was incredibly romantic, and she was such a thoughtful person.“She put her heart and soul into everything for everybody. She was always making sure that people were okay and wanted to make everything as perfect as she could. She was really good a planning. She wasn’t great at keeping things a secret. But she was great at planning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"two car collision causing lengthy tailbacks buncrana","story":"There a y tailbacks on the Buncrana Road in Derry due to a two-car collision.The

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind.

The location is simultaneously recognisable mdash and magically dferent.A love of nature can be detected in the flowers and animals that feature. Maureen Lowersquos watercolour Mayrsquos Out is a close up of delicate spring blossom while snow dominates in Mairead Pattonrsquos North Tor, Slieve Bernagh, making the mountain ascent daunting. Marilyn Priorrsquos whiskered bunny is full of Easter cheer and there is humour in Brenda OrsquoConnorrsquos Mouse Watch in the black cat that patiently awaits its prey.Allusions to history are made in James Carneyrsquos two pieces done in pen and ink in one two women in an old fashioned bar clearly disapprove of lsquoThe state of himrsquo.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility.

Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

They are Roy Walker, former player with Luton Town, Ards, Glenavon, Portadown and Crusaders and former manager of Crusaders, Glenavon and Ballymena United and Stuart Elliott, capped  times for Northern Ireland and former player with Glentoran, Motherwell, Hull City, Doncaster Rovers, Hamilton Academical and Stirling Albion.The service will be conducted by Rev Robert Bell, from Ballyclare Presbyterian Church, who has enjoyed supporting the club throughout his years in the town, and been available to give them any encouragement and support he could. The congregation will be seated in the main stand at Dixon Park, while the service will be conducted from a dais on the pitch.The club extends a warm invitation to the whole community to join them for this very special event.Daniel O’Donnell sings the praises of Learning Disability Pride Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"LARN | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"LARN | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

Down coastline.A BCM Board member is to keep schtum for a full  hours to raise funds for Copelands, the organisation’s flagship project on the Co. Down coastline.Pictured launching the sponsored silence at the Grand Central Hotel are Deputy General Manager Deborah Galloway, Peter Weil and BCM Chief Executive Nicky Conway.Notorious chatterbox Peter Weil from Helen’s Bay has been on the Board of BCMsince January and has been inspired by the fantastic work carried out by the ious projects across Northern Ireland. So much so, he has vowed to say nothing for a full -hour period.Peter said “I am slightly nervous as those who know me will attest to the fact that I barely stay quiet for five minutes, never mind a full  hours! I am hoping my friends and family, former teachers and colleagues will rally behind my effort, otherwise I am not sure how I will manage!”All funds raised will support the build and fit out of Copelands, the major investment by BCM to provide practice-leading residential, nursing and dementia care for up to  residents at its unrivalled location nestled between the Irish Sea and the rolling Co. Down countryside.BCM Chief Executive, Nicky Conway, said “We think this is a brilliant idea from a member of our Board. Former broadcaster Peter, who has also been a marketeer, lecturer, politico and communications professional, certainly knows how to talk – it’s the getting him to stop that is the issue!“Hopefully, those who know him and have experienced his innate gt of the gab will dig deep to support his efforts and the Copelands project as the build continues apace.”Peter’s  hour sponsored silence will begin at am on Friday, th May to coincide with Dementia Awareness Week, and take place in the controlled environment of a room at the Linen Quarter’s landmark Grand Central Hotel, which is kindly being sponsored by The Hastings Group.Deborah Galloway, Deputy General Manager at the Grand Central Hotel, said “The Hastings Group is delighted to be partnering with BCM for this fun and worthwhile endeavour. Having met Peter, we can appreciate his enthusiasm and dedication to the cause, and why BCM is getting behind it so fervently!“As a fellow Linen Quarter resident, we are especially delighted to be supporting BCM during its th year. Having been a pivotal presence for the local community for generations, we hope to emulate its successes with the Grand Central Hotel continuing to prove a landmark for residents and visitors to this historic part of the city centre for years to come.”BCM is celebrating its th anniversary in  with a series of fundraising efforts and initiatives to continue the le changing – and often lesaving – work of its ious projects across communities throughout Northern Ireland.No decision on Lurgan campus yet, say Education AuthorityLarne and Whitehead eye hospitality idend from The th Open Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland.
