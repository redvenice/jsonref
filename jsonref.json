Coal production fell. Workers also had to be erted from other key projects, such as fortifying Hitler’s Atlantic Wall, to repair the broken dams.But six weeks after the raid, the Ministry of Economic Warfare in London reported that, though the destruction was serious and would involve a large amount of repair work, ‘the Möhne damage did not touch the main industrial centres’. Decrypts by codebreakers at Bletchley Park showed the emergency was quickly controlled.Professor Sir Michael Howard dismissed Chastise in his official history of British Grand Strategy as ‘a spectacular feat of skill and courage, but one whose effect on the German war effort was, unfortunately, slight’.As for Barnes Wallis’s ‘bouncing bomb’, for all its wizardry, it was never used in action again. It proved to be a technological cul-de-sac, costly in lives and unusable in any other circumstances.There were other gains, however. Millions of Germans were obliged to confront the vulnerability of the Reich and the emptiness of repeated promises about their security made to them by Hitler, Goering, Goebbels.While the strategic air offensive failed to break the spirit of Hitler’s people, such a night’s work as that of 617 Squadron imposed a trauma which it seems foolish to understate.Britons, by contrast, were elated when the news broke. That spring of 1943, after nearly four years of austerity, unpalatable food, family separations and spasmodic terrors, the British people were weary.Chastise lifted their spirits and revived flagging confidence in their own nation’s powers, as had few events since the desert victory at El Alamein six months earlier. The marriage of technological brilliance with human courage and airmanship awed and thrilled them.As for the aircrew who executed it, whatever the moral ambiguities thrown up by the Dambusters raid, they will continue to deserve the admiration of their descendants.EXTRACTED from Chastise: The Dambusters Story 1943 by Max Hastings, to be published by William Collins on September 5 at £25. © Max Hastings 2019.

It involves a fist bump, a finger point and a chest pat. Most of us will never understand it, but we will see it.A photograph of the handshake is now on view in various bus stops across all five boroughs of New York City until 24 November. It’s part of a new series of images by the Bronx-born artist Elle Pérez called From Sun to Sun, which puts 16 photos on more than 100 bus stops in 13 neighborhoods in the city, from Harlem to Williamsburg.“There’s figures, portraits, the hands and environments like street scenes, fake flowers and bicycles,” said the Public Art Fund exhibition curator Katerina Stathopoulou. “Elle wanted to combine figurative work and street scenes to create a rhythm of daily life.”The photos detail Pérez’s experience growing up as a non-binary Puerto Rican in the Bronx, from flags to special meals, community leaders and pensive moments with city architecture.“It’s a decentered exhibit outside of a gallery or museum,” said Stathopoulou. “There’s something so powerful about Elle’s portraits and environments that is so engaging, which is apparent in their work.”The photo of the handshake credits its co-creators, Jay P Fury and Bryan Keith, friends of Pérez. “It’s a handshake specific to the Bronx,” said Stathopoulou. “The fist pump and the chest touch. It’s created in the punk scene, which Elle was involved with as a teenager. Elle incorporated images specific to their experience.”“Elle asked: ‘What is the daily rhythm of New York, what is the cyclical nature of life in New York?’” said Stathopoulou. “There’s a familiarity but also an abstraction in terms of the details of the city it has the presence and absence of people in New York. It’s meant to be a meditation on daily life in New York City.”The bus shelters are strategically placed in neighborhoods that are important to the artist – from the Bronx to East Harlem, East Williamsburg and Queens. “It’s not meant to represent New York as a whole but it’s Elle’s personal story of New York,” said Stathopoulou. “It’s to portray their experiences of growing up in New York, born in the Bronx and living in Brooklyn – the familiar people, the places they frequent and the experiences that Elle has daily.”The artist, who has previously documented the queer and Latinx communities of New York, told Art21 that their artwork has always been made collaboratively, “because my work has a raw, visceral relationship to emotional authenticity”, said Pérez. “People haven often recommended that I go into documentary, but I could never figure out the ethics of it.”Pérez’s photos look like they’re casually taken but they’re staged. One photo shows a woman and child gardening at school. The woman is Pérez’s sister, who is an outdoor educator in the Bronx, planting raspberries and evergreen shrubs with a student.There’s also a photo of an East Harlem middle school teacher named Brendan, seated wearing a tie. “As an educator at the school, he shaped the curriculum of what students learn, one of the reasons Elle wanted to include him in the series,” said Stathopoulou. “Education is another theme.”Another photo depicts a Dominican street food dish that Pérez has found in their Brooklyn neighborhood. “The people eating the dish in the photo are all close friends,” Stathopoulou said. “Elle wanted to capture this daily activity, this routine moment of sharing a meal among friends. Brooklyn and the Bronx are both important to Elle, personally and photographically.”One of the most poignant images is a portrait of a man with the Puerto Rican flag tattooed on his arm. It says “Mi orgullo”, which reads, in Spanish, “my pride”.“Elle wanted to shoot it in black and white as an opposition against the US government’s oversight of Puerto Rico and the control they have over their economy,” said Stathopoulou. “This is Elle’s way of showing solidarity to support Puerto Rico. It ties into Elle’s experience in now, in present day New York.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d2285b1685535dbfb8a7503df78b0b398558f6/0_148_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b512471a8cfa7b3f69ae6d61c84d56a0","title":"forget the louvre heres our loo people who turn their homes into art galleries","story":"With exhibition space squeezed, artists are turning to their own domestic spaces to put on shows between the pots and pans in the kitchen, their bedrooms – and even the smallest roomTwo months after Isobel Atacus moved into her new home in Walthamstow, London, she made an unusual decision: she would turn her living space into an art gallery. Since then, exhibitions have happened in every room, even the loo.“Last year we exhibited a work that was a kind of ecosystem, stretched out over the floor of our living room,” she says. “There was was a block of ice melting through an unfired clay disc into a bowl below and the sediment water was pumped into a tank. It was a beautiful piece to live with for a few days.”Atacus is among a small but growing number of artists giving other artists space in their homes to put on shows. This is art that is happening between the pots and pans in the kitchen, on the living room window sill or above the gas fire.Called the icing room, Atacus’s gallery is part of a growing market that includes Bunkhouse, an on-off residency in Hackney, London, run by Sophie Rogers Bede House, in New Cross, London, run by Stephanie Busson and Flat38 in Margate, run by Claire Orme.Some artists don’t not have a whole home to offer but that has not stopped them. In 2013, Lola Bunting turned the living room of her parents’ house in Hackney, into the 53 Beck Road gallery and has put on 18 shows. “Some people show up and you can see they are thinking, ‘What is this?’” says Bunting. “But it is easier to have conversations about the work than in a traditional gallery.”Like most of the other galleries, 53 Beck Road grew from a feeling that exhibition space in London was squeezed. “It is hard as an artist,” says Bunting. “There’s lots of spaces but it is harder to make an exhibition than it used to be. I wanted to do something and work collaboratively.” That feeling of being squeezed out isn’t restricted to London. Fiona Candlin, professor of museology at Birkbeck University in London, has been documenting small independent museums in the UK for a project called Mapping Museums. “If lots of people are setting up small galleries in their homes,” she says, “that suggests a very different model of what it means to be a curator and what it means to have an exhibition. It is a much less professionalised model, more ad hoc and closer to a DIY aesthetic. That gives a very different sense of what’s happening in the art world, especially when you compare it with the new, more formal galleries opening up.”Bunting’s parents, Karen and Peter, are both artists and moved into Beck Road in the late 70s under Acme, a housing-for-artists scheme. Back then, Hackney was full of empty houses. Today, the front room gallery is in an area that is way out of the average artist’s rent range, a reminder of how important giving affordable space to artists really is.The cost of space is a reason these galleries exist, but it isn’t the only one. Orme set up Flat38 in her two-bedroom duplex so she could find a community of artists and art lovers. “It just felt like the right thing to do,” she says, “to invite them into my home, rather than into another space that none of us had a relationship with.” Her most ambitious exhibition so far was Merz, an installation of large paper sculptures by Samuel Keyte that were hung throughout the flat. During the opening, Orme used her bedroom as a bar.Going against the grain of the traditional white cube gallery space is another appeal. Unlike the plain-walled behemoths of the art world, these galleries are maintained by people who are working full-time and have their own art practice, too. “I’m really interested in what a domestic space can be,” says Atacus. “It is kind of a threshold, neither art setting nor domestic setting. We need spaces where we can have conversations. There is this need, we all feel, to take exhibiting into our own hands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f54fb52f012525bd30a0e01f978f0368ab24861/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e388594963c64139b6340584b587996","title":"home post apartheid south africa thabiso sekgala in pictures","story":"Thabiso Sekgala’s solo show features work taken by the late South African photographer offering nuanced, alternative narratives about life in contemporary Africa.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

If power cuts can happen when just two power generators drop off, then something fundamental has gone wrong.”National Grid had only 1,000MW in reserve as backup supply when the outages took place. The combined power capacity lost in the twin outages was more than 1,300MW.In addition, the strike may have also triggered outages at a string of “embedded” generators – such as small-scale renewables and diesel farms – totalling an estimated 500MW.These off-grid generators are not visible to National Grid, which can only estimate the amount of electricity they add by noting a fall in demand for on-grid electricity when they run and a rise in demand when they shut off.The energy regulator has responded by launching an investigation into whether National Grid’s statutory requirements, which are set by Ofgem, require it to hold enough reserve electricity supplies to stabilise the grid following outages. revealed National Grid had suffered three blackout “near misses” in as many months after similar-sized outages in May, June and July, which were all greater than 1,000MW.Ofgem will also investigate whether the energy generators and regional energy networks responded correctly to the sudden loss in frequency caused by the power plants’ trips.Jonathan Brearley, a senior executive at Ofgem, said the regulator had received the report and believed there were still areas that needed to be investigated.“This will ensure the industry learns the relevant lessons and clearly establish whether any firm breached their obligations to deliver secure power supplies to consumers,” he said.“The power cuts of Friday 9 August caused interruptions to consumers’ energy and significant disruption to commuters. It’s important that the industry takes all possible steps to prevent this happening again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ca2e02ac294019dfe8b2d15e2ac1e76f9871a2/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7280f06b021d4271d4b69a9990e50346","title":"natwest rbs users credit card glitch outage","story":"Outage comes as many people prepare to pay monthly billsNatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland customers have been hit by computer problems preventing them from accessing credit card information, and the bank’s call centres are unable to deal with credit card queries.The outage, which is believed to have first been spotted in the early hours of Monday, comes at an unfortunate time for many customers as they prepare to pay their monthly bills.Generally, RBS customers have until the end of the 20th of the month to pay off their credit cards in full if they wish to avoid interest or other charges.The bank has not posted any information about the computer glitch on its social media feeds or mobile app, but it said on its website: “Some customers are unable to view credit card information on online and mobile banking.“We are also experiencing some problems with our telephony service for credit cards, which is limiting our ability to assist customers over the phone. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause. We are working to resolve these problems as quickly as possible.”The glitch is likely to affect a relatively small number of RBS’s 14 million customers, given that few have yet aired their complaints on social media. But RBS remains haunted by the worst IT failure to hit a UK bank, when in 2012 its services went into meltdown after a failed software upgrade.That failure, plus the crash at TSB in April last year, prompted regulators and consumer groups to demand tougher action to ensure Britain’s banks are operationally resilient.In March, Which? Money revealed that British banks were being hit by IT or security failures that prevented customers from making payments at an average rate of more than once a day.In the most comprehensive analysis carried out since banks started disclosing serious IT glitches, the consumer group found there were 302 incidents that prevented customers from making payments in the last nine months of 2018.A spokesperson for RBS said: “We are aware that some of our customers are experiencing intermittent problems viewing their credit cards online and on the mobile app. This is a result of system issues being experienced by a third-party service provider. “We apologise to any customers impacted and are working with the third-party provider to resolve these issues as quickly as possible. Customers can continue to use their credit cards as usual and no customer will be left out of pocket.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aca5cf1637e3da9ec345df3a93fb380bb8b10db5/625_388_4175_2505/master/4175.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46e17de1389499a9fac79e315f6c72bc","title":"eu citizen uk priti patel britain brexit","story":"Being an EU citizen living in the UK for the past three years has largely had the same rhythm as an undergraduate degree: relax, relax, panic for a week, enter a deep state of denial, relax, relax and repeat.We have either been forgotten about for months at a time, breezily told that everything will be fine (but we shouldn’t bother filling our pretty little heads with the fine print), or reminded that our main function resides with the services we provide to Britons. EU citizens are mostly great when we pick your fruit or treat your gran we may choose other professions, but should have the decency to stay quiet if we do so.At least it hasn’t been boring: forget hobbies or speed dating, if you feel you spend too much time stuck inside your own head, constantly wondering what will happen to your legal status in the country you chose to call home should keep you busy.In the latest instalment of our saga, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has rejected previous plans to maintain freedom of movement until January 2021 in case of a no-deal Brexit – instead now aiming to end it on 31 October if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, which it currently looks like it will.Given that we had originally been given until 31 December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme – and that the Home Office has a less than tremendous record of dealing with people who have a complex immigration status – this does not seem ideal.There is a certain element of fatigue to all of this: if previous hare-brained government plans are anything to go by, they will eventually figure out something for us which, while still bad, will at least be marginally less inconvenient. Well, maybe they won’t, but as with everything else in British politics at the moment, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.Still, there is something particularly grating about this new development and the nagging feeling that, had she been able to, Patel would have retroactively ended free movement on 24 June 2016.The past three years has forced EU citizens living in the UK to learn not to take things personally. The country you visited and fell in love with and decided to move to voted to leave the bloc your home country is a member of partly because of people like you who decided to move here.The country across the Channel from all your family and childhood friends where you decided to spend a while, maybe the rest of your life – who knows? – strangled itself in red lines just so it could make sure that it becomes harder for people like you to move here.The language you learned and lovingly perfected over the years and now speak every day became deafening in its attacks on the scheme that inspired you to pack up your bags and start a new, hopefully better life here.The prime minister who made a career out of wanting as few of you as possible moving to her country was ousted, in part because her efforts to make it harder for people like you to move to this country were not deemed ardent enough.She has now been replaced, and the priority of the new home secretary is to make sure the likes of you find it harder to move here, as quickly as possible. But it’s not about us, of course – the British people voted to leave and now they must leave, but sometimes they do worry about their fruit and their gran, and so we are trotted out once more, then put aside until we are needed again.The problem with internalising this need to remain quiet and out of the conversation is that unacknowledged melancholy only grows stronger. There are only so many times we can choose to be quiet or pointedly sardonic, lest we be accused of being melodramatic, or told to leave if we no longer like it here.The UK has not been a pleasant place to live for European immigrants since the referendum, and phases of brief panic followed by months of denial do not make for the most stable of mindsets.Maybe free movement will not end on 31 October as Patel wants, or maybe it will – maybe it is an overreaction to find this desperate move to close borders as soon as possible profoundly disheartening, or maybe it isn’t. Who knows?As British people may recognise, the problem with bottling up your emotions for too long means that sometimes they all come out at once, not when they should but when you’ve had enough.That it is such a typically British way to cope is, at the very least, a decent sign of thorough integration: hopefully that will count towards something if the Home Office changes its mind again.• Marie Le Conte is a French journalist living in London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8378e6fc19ce0467eea143ccd7f16445ce14157d/0_183_5499_3299/master/5499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e4e7a2c1fc2349ad58df774eb12877c","title":"real consequence no deal brexit long recession","story":"Those opposed to no deal need to stop predicting an apocalypse and instead focus on the slow economic destruction it will bringA couple of days before the UK voted to leave the EU, the official remain campaign, Stronger In, released a bulletin of what it imagined the news headlines to be the next day in the event of a leave vote. Job losses would ensue, it said prices would rise, the pound would plummet, and the UK would be stuck in a protracted negotiation process for the next decade. (Tellingly, the issue of the Irish border wasn’t mentioned.)Since the vote, sure, life is worse in the UK than it was in 2016 – but it’s hard to pin that on Brexit, as a sense of national decline is at least partly why a majority voted to leave in the first place. Indeed, aside from the parliamentary absurdities of the past three years, it’s fair to say that the predicted catastrophe hasn’t really happened. In fact, the principal group of people whose lives have been immediately disrupted by Brexit are EU citizens and the victims of increased racist hate crimes. Shamefully, that doesn’t seem to be reason enough to give us pause as a nation – and so we’ve pressed on.As Boris Johnson spends yet another day projecting ostensible ambivalence about a no-deal scenario, the anti-no-deal political and media alliance finds itself repeating the final days of the EU referendum campaign, by issuing almost daily warnings of social and economic catastrophe. The crescendo of these warnings was the government’s own Operation Yellowhammer documents leaked over the weekend, which foretold instant disruption to medical and food supplies, and imports from the EU.But what if full-scale abrupt meltdown doesn’t happen, as it didn’t in 2016? And what if those predicting it are written off as the empty managers of “project fear” once again? The current government isn’t hamstrung by an austerity narrative as David Cameron’s was, and anyone familiar with Dominic Cummings’s writings knows that he believes Westminster to be flush with cash that just isn’t being spent properly. It’s quite possible the government will throw money at a no-deal scenario to keep disruption as minimal and temporary as possible. If the apocalyptic scenarios for no deal aren’t felt from 1 November onwards, what will happen to the credibility of those predicting them?This is important because an anti-no-deal Brexit alliance needs credibility with the public in order to talk about a much worse consequence of a no-deal Brexit: a slow-burn recession. A few weeks before the Operation Yellowhammer leak, Unite the Union presented a briefing in parliament on the effects of no deal on British industry. This briefing was much more consequential and frightening than anything produced by the various pro-EU campaigns. In careful detail, it lays out the thousands upon thousands of jobs that would be threatened by no deal, most of them located in parts of the country that are already struggling economically. Just one example of this is Airbus, which has said it is contemplating relocating its UK sites. Airbus employs half of its 14,000-strong workforce in Wales, the region that currently receives the most EU structural funding in the UK. Shortly after Britain voted to leave the EU, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that nearly a quarter of the Welsh population is already living in poverty. On 1 November 2019, life in Wales may not be any different than it is now. But immiserated by the previous recession, long-term deindustrialisation and successive governments that haven’t seemed all that bothered about anywhere outside of the M25, it is crucial to ask whether Welsh communities will be able to withstand the loss of key industries and structural funding. There is no plan for these communities in the event of no deal their fates are being ignored in favour of spectacular fantasies about traffic jams in Kent.Those opposing no deal must stop focusing so heavily on the prospect of immediate disaster, and start talking more about what the UK might look like in five or 10 years’ time, after the asset stripping of British industry has taken place.The reasons for the leave vote are complex and multifaceted, but it was seen by some as offering a solution for the many people in the UK who had experienced a decade of economic hardship since the 2008 financial crisis. The remain campaign eschewed responding to that issue in favour of trying to frighten the public into staying in the EU. It’s now time for the opponents of no deal to learn from the remain campaign’s mistake. If they don’t, the architects of a broken and ided nation may well get away with it again.• Ellie Mae O’Hagan writes about politics and culture for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c019c73ff01288932578ba9a6a7cd7f4c895daf0/188_225_4896_2937/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6758db9ef3af1a08d5a5dab31659f7a","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of appetite","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘appetite’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘appetite’.Share your photos of what appetite means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 21 August at 10am.

But these are young people wanting to make their way out into the world and you feel really pivotal to their next move. If they don’t get the results they want, it just breaks your heart and you can’t help but feel quite personally accountable.I never sleep the night before the results. As teachers, we’re judged on our performance, so part of my anxiety is my own sense of professional accountability, questioning whether I’ve delivered what my headteacher expects me to. But, most of all, there’s this feeling of so desperately wanting my students, who I’ve prepped and taught and supported for two years, to just nail it.My happiest memory is of a dyslexic young man who did just that. When he found out his result, he picked me up in his arms and twirled me around in front of everyone, saying: “Oh my God, I couldn’t have done it without you, Miss.”It’s such a nerve-racking and anxiety-inducing day. One minute, I’ll be shrieking and jumping up and down with celebrating students. The next, I’ll be in a quiet corner, comforting a devastated child who feels like nothing will be OK ever again.I am always rooting for the students who have a difficult home life or don’t find academic work easy. When they do well, it’s exhilarating. You know you’ve helped to shape that young person’s life. That’s why most of us go into teaching. It’s the best moment of your career.I’ll sleep badly for weeks before results day, especially if I know Ofsted will visit us within the next academic year and our results will be heavily scrutinised. In the past, it has made me quite ill. I’ll sit up thinking about different scenarios, wondering how my results will be treated publicly and the impact they will have on the school in general. Also, I still teach maths and the inidual results of that class are really important to my sense of self-worth, both as a teacher and as a head. If I’m telling other people what to do, I want them to know I can do it too.Once I get the actual results, my concerns become much more about the children again – which is obviously what I should have been thinking about all the time. I get angry with myself for worrying about anything else.Every year there will be certain kids you really want to see get their results. Usually it’s the ones who have battled against the odds. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them get their brown envelope. You try not to stare but you look for their reaction.There are times kids work flat-out and still don’t get what they need. They’re the heartbreakers.One boy I taught a few years ago needed to pass maths to do electrical engineering at college. His predictions meant it would be an outside chance, but he and I both did all we could. In the end, he was a few marks off a C grade. He was devastated. He cried, and I cried. I told him to come up to my office. I wrote him a letter for his college, saying how hard he’d worked and that his maths was good enough for the course, and to please put him on it. I even phoned the principal and said: “He was so close, can you give him a go?” And she agreed. We sent off his exam for remarking but they let him start anyway.At the end of results day, I might crack open a cold beer. I’m still thinking about the children, wondering: what can I do to help them? There’s always a bit of leftover anxiety, hoping that the results they’ve got are what they need to take their next step in life. Then eventually I’ll disappear off home to fall asleep on the sofa.I privately broke down with happiness one year when I saw one of my students had got the results he needed to study marine biology. In our first lesson together, four years previously, he had told me it was his dream. I was excited to see him so happy on results day. He came to see me afterwards to thank me for helping him on his journey. I found that whole experience so validating.On results day, I see the transformative effect my school and the teachers can have on kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, and that really motivates me. One young man from a deprived area had spent most of his GCSE years in a pupil referral unit. He came to our school and absolutely thrived. He left with two A*s and an A and went on to a top university. When children do well, it makes you feel proud. I can’t wait to see the faces of those children and speak to their parents.The night before – I never sleep. I ruminate on the difficult decisions I’ve made throughout the year. As a senior leader, I invest a lot of my time making sure these children get good results. I have lots of difficult conversations with parents, children and teachers about why people are not progressing. It’s really important to me that, if I’m doing all the correct things, it’s reflected in the results.It’s rewarding to see the sheer joy and disbelief on children’s faces on results day. The hardest thing for me is when phenomenal students are a few marks off the top grades they need to get into a prestigious university. Some universities will keep them hanging for a few days and then refuse to let them in, which I think is really cruel. Those are the saddest cases for me. These students may be awarded a higher grade if they choose to get their paper remarked, but by then the university place they wanted may have gone. That feels really unfair. But there’s nothing I can say. The decision is totally out of my hands.On one memorable results day, I was pregnant. I had promised to email two boys their results – this was in the days everything was sent by post – and I went into labour prematurely at 6am. So I got my phone out on the way to the hospital and messaged the boys their results. My husband was like: what are you doing? But I was determined to let those kids know how well they had done. My daughter was born an hour later.• Interviews by Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064b7b6aa2d279b557f9765810e756051c5a458c/0_1431_3984_2388/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96aa215027037b27e1a960e68597f142","title":"i dont blame any teacher for not coming out as gay","story":"I’d been a teacher for over 10 years before I felt comfortable enough to just be myself. I had settled into a rhythm. I wanted to be a great maths teacher – why did I have to face the burden of being a role model for LGBTQ students too?Some colleagues knew about my sexuality. If someone asked about my “husband”, I’d casually tell them the situation. And it was working OK. Then one day the stakes suddenly got bigger.I had an interview for an assistant headship in a comprehensive in a semi-rural area. I was the only candidate invited back for a second interview. My potential future boss spoke warmly about the ethos of the school and the importance of his Catholic faith. As a member of the senior team, I’d be working closely with this man. I suddenly thought: if he turns out to be a homophobe, this will be a problem. It seemed an important moment – for my future, and for his.That day, we’d moved house. I’d had to wiggle out of my jeans and into my interview dress in the car a couple of roads away from the school. I was a little flustered as well as having the usual interview nerves. I mentioned that I’d come straight from collecting the keys.“Oh, why the move?” he asked.“We need a bigger house now we have twins,” I said.He looked at me. I clearly didn’t look like somebody who had given birth to twins a month ago.“My partner had them – she’s at home with them now,” I said.And there, I had come out in my interview.There was a brief silence. “Oh, yes we have another teacher like you – she and her partner are going through IVF right now,” he said. And that was it.I know a handful of teachers and school leaders who are not out as LGBTQ at work in any way. The majority of the teachers I’ve known who were LGBTQ were out to staff but not to students. I can’t blame anybody in either group. For some it’s because they are not yet fully out in their personal lives. Others are from visible minority groups and don’t want to add something else that they feel will count against them in interviews or for promotions.Their fears are justified. Stonewall reports that LGBTQ staff across all workplaces who are BAME are more likely to lose their jobs than white LGBTQ colleagues. And for teachers who are single or currently in a heterosexual-looking relationship, being honest about their sexuality can feel like too much of a statement. Bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out.One school leader described her inner conflict to me: “I look at others, the confidence they have, the sense of complete ease and comfort, and I want to be involved. Then, days like today when I’m feeling overwhelmed and I’m not OK with it all, I certainly can’t be the ‘role model’. Where does that come from? Self-preservation? Protection? Shame?”In my lifetime, I’ve seen the advent of civil partnerships and same-sex marriages IVF rules have changed. In the wider commonwealth, homosexuality has been decriminalised – in India and Trinidad. But in England in 2019 there is transphobic hate crime and we’ve seen lesbian couples being assaulted on public transport in our capital city. Hundreds of parents have withdrawn their children from schools in Birmingham and protested because they didn’t want them to be taught about equality for LGBTQ people.In such a climate, I would not pass judgment on any teacher or school leader who decides not to come out. Sometimes they simply feel unsafe. How do people know they will be supported – by colleagues, by school leaders, by the government?In my own case, I had lingering memories of hearing that homosexuality was wrong and recurring thoughts of hell and damnation after a childhood of church on Sundays. And having been educated in the 80s and 90s, with the impact of section 28, which barred “promoting” homosexuality, added to my internalised homophobia. People my age, and especially those who are now teachers, are still living with the fallout from this.My journey to being open was a long one. Before I became a teacher I was a fleet engineer for a train operating company. None of my colleagues then knew about my sexuality. This was an almost entirely male environment. I split my time between the office and the train depot where pictures of page 3 pin-ups were standard. I didn’t fancy being the subject of banter.Deciding engineering wasn’t for me, in 2004 I enrolled in Teach First, the teacher training organisation. By now, fed up of being vague about my life outside work, I decided I would be out to my colleagues. It helped that I liked everyone and felt generally supported.In my early teaching jobs, my policy was to be out to other staff but not to students. This felt safe for me. I was teaching in a faith school. My colleagues were respectful, but I had nagging doubts: would the school leadership support me in the face of any comments from parents or students? I didn’t want it tested.As I became more comfortable with my sexuality in my private life – my family were mostly on my side – the same became true at work. It was easier when I went to work in a school where there were other openly gay teachers. One, a close friend, was also out to pupils and things were fine.Eventually, once I was an assistant headteacher, I came out to a Year 9 class I knew well, correcting them when they assumed I had a “husband”. They hadn’t expected me to be gay and asked a bit about if I’d always known, but the lesson carried on as normal. I thought it would be all around the school by the end of the day. But it wasn’t. I had taught for over 10 years by then. I’d been on a journey – through different schools and on a personal journey of my own acceptance.Being out has been hard at times. I’ve suffered homophobic abuse in public for nothing more than sitting next to my partner on a train or walking our dogs together. Being out is not an event, it’s an ongoing process. It’s daunting but it gets easier. For me, the journey has been worth it for my own mental health and wellbeing. But I don’t blame anyone for taking their time.The real onus should be on schools to create an environment that makes staff and students feel safe enough to be honest about their sexuality. I felt able to come out at my interview because the school had a Stonewall schools champion logo on its website. These gestures may seem small but LGBTQ people notice them and they matter.• Safety and health first.

They face men in the country’s second isionBy Gavin Willacy for Playing in the ShadowsDespite Ajax going desperately close to reaching the Champions League final, the Ereisie seems to be out of fashion with Premier League recruiters. Only two players moved from the Dutch league to the Premier League this summer. Coincidentally, they went to last season’s top two, with Manchester City paying PSV £5.3m for Angeliño and Liverpool signing 17-year-old Sepp van den Berg from Zwolle for £4.4m. In contrast, six players arrived from Belgium at a cost of £98m.Below the top six clubs in the Ereisie, budgets are small, ranging from €7m to €17m, similar to clubs towards the top of League 1 and bottom of the Championship. The Ereisie has been a source of talent in the past. Dennis Bergkamp, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Luis Suárez were all top scorers in the league before lighting up the Premier League. And both Romário and Ronaldo won the golden boot in the Netherlands as they made the move to European football.The most prolific Ereisie strikers have made far less impact in England in recent times. Mateja Kezman was top scorer three times but flopped at Chelsea Dirk Kuyt was a hero at Liverpool more for his workrate and versatility than his goals Wilfried Bony struggled after his big move to Manchester City and is currently training with Newport County and Vincent Janssen never lived up to his £17m price tag after signing for Tottenham.Earlier this month, I spent a week in the Netherlands with the Burton Albion and Ipswich Town youth teams, who were visiting on Erasmus+ programmes organised by League Football Education. The trip gave us a chance to learn more about the systems Dutch clubs use to bring through youth players. Most of the country’s top clubs have a second – “jong” (young) – team playing in a lower league against men rather than their peers, from the second tier to the fourth.The youth squads are very similar to Premier League 2 sides. Players are supposed to be Under-23 and homegrown but, in reality, most are teenagers and there is the odd foreign player too. There are four youth teams in the second tier this season: Jong Ajax, Jong AZ, Jong PSV and Jong Utrecht. Marc Overmars and Winston Bogarde are in charge of the Jong Ajax players, all of whom are 20 or younger (asides from a 22-year-old goalkeeper). Jong AZ, coached by former Manchester City cult hero Michael Vonk, range from 17 to 22. The same goes for Jong Utrecht, who have three overseas players: a German, a Romanian and a Belorussian.In a league where most clubs bring in crowds between 3,000 and 8,000, Jong PSV drew an average gate of just 771 last season. Ajax averaged 695, Jong AZ had 629 and Utrecht a mere 526. Dress it up all you like, but no one wants to watch the kids – especially against men. It’s a lose-lose for the senior team in the contest.The jong system operates throughout Dutch professional football, which changes hugely after the top two isions. Jong Sparta Rotterdam and Jong FC Voldendam stand out in the semi-professional third tier – Tweede Divisie – in which every other club is just that: a club. All inclusive, wide-ranging, a community hub. Excelsior have 39 teams VV Katwijk have 59 Quick Boys have 101. Some clubs have more than 2,000 registered players.Unlike in the UK, most Dutch clubs only contract their most talented youngsters. NAC Breda, who were relegated from the Ereisie last season, have just seven paid players in their Under-20s. Given they have around 40 players split between their Under-17s and Under-19s, competition for contracts is fierce.Having enjoyed the hospitality in the Netherlands, we moved across the German border, where Ipswich Under-18s were well beaten by the Bayer 04 Under-19s (the last Bayer team before their Bundesliga squad). A few years ago, Bayer decided to fold their reserve team, which was playing in the fourth ision, believing that the standard was too low and the gap to their Champions League-chasing first team was too big. Not everyone in the academy agreed, but now they send their best young players on loan instead. Again, only the very best Under-19s are awarded professional contracts. Just two of last year’s squad were offered deals.The danger of releasing almost all of your players at 19 means some will come back to haunt you. Bayer let midfielder Kevin Kampl leave on a free before he had even made a first-team appearance. Four years later, they paid £10m to bring him back and have since sold him to RB Leipzig for twice that. They didn’t seem too concerned. Quality not quantity appears to be their unwritten motto.Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool played in the Leasing Trophy a fortnight ago. No idea what that is? It’s the old CheckatradeAuto WindscreensFreight-RoverJohnstones PaintLDV Vans EFL Trophy.After opting out for a couple of years, the country’s biggest clubs are now entering Under-21 teams in the controversial competition. Commitments elsewhere meant they were given dispensation to kick off early. While the all-EFL ties start on 3 September, United, Chelsea and Liverpool played before the Premier League had begun, with Arsenal and Everton starting their campaigns next week.United’s Under-21s, captained by Angel Gomes and now coached by Neil Wood – himself a former United reserve player – won 2-0 at Rotherham. Liverpool’s youngsters lost 3-2 at Oldham. Chelsea reserves, now under Andy Myers, won at Swindon with two early goals from Tino Anjorin, an 18-year-old from Poole. Having sent ten young players out on loan, sold three more and let released another six, Chelsea’s PL2 side will look very different this season.Life is not too bright at Newcastle United. Their Under-23s began their Premier League 2 season by losing 6-0 at Reading last Monday. They rarely threatened a Royals reserves’ defence marshalled by Chris Gunter. Still only 30, Gunter is a veteran of nearly 500 Premier League and Championship games with Cardiff, Spurs, Forest and, since 2012, Reading. His young teammates must have gained plenty from playing alongside someone with 93 international caps.History of sorts was made in Tiptree last Monday afternoon. Wigan Athletic’s second string made their Professional Development League bow, having moved across from the Central League as a result of gaining Category Two academy status this summer.Clad in all red, Nick Chadwick’s side thoroughly deserved their 3-0 win at Colchester’s pastoral training ground. Wigan were already on top when the Us were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half. Impressive centre forward Joe Piggott poached the Latics’ opening two goals. Aged 21, Piggott has spent time on loan at Dundee United and Morecambe during an injury-hit career. Tall, strong and hard-working, he looks capable of an EFL career.Chuffed Wigan academy manager Gregor Rioch admitted that the club are not really sure what to expect from the PDL and whether this group will be up to the mark. Monday’s display suggested they will be fine.Tottenham opened their sparkling new training ground in Enfield, where they began their Under-21 Premier League campaign against Manchester City. Spurs featured Andros Townsend on the left wing and Harry Kane up front in front of a midfield containing Nabil Bentaleb, Sandro Cordeiro and Tom Carroll.Carroll pulled the strings, feeding Townsend, who provided Kane with a procession of chances. He took three of them as Spurs won 6-3. Within two months, Townsend had made his full England debut within two years, so had Kane.• Follow Gavin Willacy and Playing in the Shadows on Twitter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3394ba0e33393d268c079dfb073946d03bee00ca/99_1083_922_553/master/922.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e9708b3acc04488c381e90743b42b905","title":"from cyberpunk 2077 to the outer worlds are role playing games getting too predictable","story":"Two forthcoming games are generating a lot of buzz – but they also suggest the genre is in need of a shakeupIt might be set in space rather than on an Earth ravaged by nuclear war, but there is a strong argument that The Outer Worlds, a forthcoming first-person role-playing game (RPG) by storied developers Obsidian, is spiritually a Fallout game. Not only is it directed by Fallout creators Tim Cain and Leonard Boyarsky, it shares a lot of DNA with Obsidian’s Fallout: New Vegas – a spin-off with a reputation as the best in the series. New Vegas earned particular praise for its dialogue, and a world-building background that makes it feel like more than a thin justification for firing mini-nukes at super-mutants.New Vegas was Obsidian’s first and last game set in the Fallout universe, but The Outer Worlds places similar importance on freedom of choice in dialogue and gameplay. In this world, where mega corporations are starting to take over alien planets, you can act like a hero, an opportunistic mercenary, or a total idiot. The writing is sharp, snappy and funny, the world exciting and vibrant, and there’s a classic New Vegas interplay between factions of characters, any of whom the player can help or hinder.The genre of choice-based, do-what-you-like narrative game that The Outer Worlds inhabits – sometimes called “immersive sims” – is one I love. But it has ossified so much that a 2019 game can build on the legacy of one from 2010 without needing to change much.This year’s E3 games expo was a stark reminder of how formulaic games in this mould have become. Showing off The Outer Worlds for the first time, Obsidian had the player arriving on a new planet and heading off obediently to infiltrate a facility on the ask of a quest-giver. Depending on whether the player’s character is created for intelligence, stealth, strength or whatever else, they can go in guns blazing sneak around without being noticed or use a combination of charm, intimidation, persuasion and hacking to waltz in as if they own the place. But on meeting the head of the facility, there’s a twist: they offer to double your fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you.When I went to see the near-future action-RPG Cyberpunk 2077, Polish developer CD Projekt showed the player arriving in a new part of the game world, heading off to meet a quest-giver and being told to infiltrate a facility. You can take three broad approaches, we’re told: go in guns blazing sneak around or chat your way inside. But once again, on meeting the head of the facility, they offer to double the fee if you go back and kill the person who sent you there in the first place.In tone and style, Cyberpunk 2077 and The Outer Worlds are different: one is a gritty, violent, urban affair, the other colourful sci-fi. But the fundamental skeleton the games are built on is so constricting that, given an hour to show off everything they could be, both developers independently converged on a near-identical script.Genre conventions like this have their advantages. Film has embraced the three-act structure for years pop songs have settled on a rhythm of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus. They provide creators with structure and familiarity on top of which innovation can occur without fear of alienating audiences.But every now and again, a game comes along which shows that innovation can happen without putting people off and revives a genre in the process. The Ubisoft model was once to open-world games what the Fallout model is to first-person RPGs. The blueprint: climb towers to unlock new areas, sprinkle a map with icons representing mini goals to reach, make progress at your leisure. It underpinned Ubisoft’s Assassins Creed, Far Cry and Watch Dogs series, Warner Bros’ Batman and Middle Earth franchises, and many others.Then came The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in 2017. It’s got the towers, the open-world, and the plethora of smaller activities to distract you from the main noble quest. But it quietly revolutionised that stale old structure. Nothing in Breath of the Wild is gated. If you wanted (and you were extremely skilled) you could simply walk to the final boss and finish the game, though you would be far more likely to be lasered to death by  robots on the way up to the castle. The icon-filled map is almost entirely gone: only fast-travel points and the occasional quest-line show up. The rest is there for you to discover with your eyes and ears, rather than following objective markers like an orienteering enthusiast.I’m looking forward to The Outer Worlds and Cyberpunk 2077. But their genre needs its Breath of the Wild moment: an outsider to toss out the conventions, and build something beautiful from what is left. Surely choosing between shooting, stealthing or sweet talking can’t be the only options that the next generation of virtual worlds have to offer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8ff2612b0ff08fc57bc6141da81e2c192249aaa/0_306_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fac2efa93114c7c56508c26ee8b8c72","title":"spectrum colour yoga and meditation like being stuck inside a traffic light","story":"The effect of being immersed in deep colours is striking, but I am not sure it is the best way to relax, especially when the lights stop working properly‘I am not good at yoga” is the main thought I have in any yoga class. I am definitely thinking it today. My warrior II would have been discharged from military service. My eagle pose looks like a cheese plait. It is not even clear I can lie on the floor properly. Sweating, shaking, constantly on the verge of toppling over, at least here I can partially blame the fact that the room keeps changing hue.That is because I am trying a 90-minute Spectrum yoga and meditation session, conducted in a special colour-shifting studio in Whitechapel, east London (available via a MoveGB membership, £19.99 a week). On the wall at the front of the class are panels of large bulbs, emitting bright light. It is very Sunday Night at the London Palladium. I feel as if I am dying, but at least I am in good company.This variety of yoga was created by Mandy Jhamat, my tutor today, who developed the concept with Pierre Van Obberghen, a “colour expert”. The class is based on vinyasa flow, incorporating salutations, standing poses and balances – or, in my case, a blancmange of all three.We start with the room full of white light (which contains all the colours of the spectrum) before moving into aquarium turquoise, buttery yellow and breakdown-at-the-nuclear-plant red.The flicker-free, deep-colour immersion is striking: it is as if I am in a music video or a Tate Modern installation. It is pretty cool – or would be if I could remove my knees from my ears. I am not sure the colours are aiding me, but I am too all over the place to be sensitive to it.The connection between colour and energy is plausible, though. Colour has a biochemical, psychological, emotional effect on us. Think about food, or art, or the eyes of your beloved. The inside of McDonald’s isn’t bright red and yellow because it was designed by a clown it is because those colours make us feel hungry and eat quickly, encouraging a high turnaround. (Actually, the seating these days is soft green and lower-lit. Nudging our minds to believe they are in Starbucks, perhaps? Why are you so stupid, mind?)After the yoga, there is a 25-minute guided meditation, in which we lie on the floor. This will, I think, be a better way for me to experience the vibrational potentialities of colour and focus on Jhamat’s concept. We are offered the option of a blanket or a weighted eye mask, the latter of which surely defeats the point of bathing yourself in a colour field. Jhamat leads us through a guided meditation exploring our chakras, each of which – according to tantra – has a corresponding colour. We start bathed in red, the root chakra, before the bulbs soften into the orange of the sacral chakra and lighten into the yellow of the solar plexus chakra, the best chakra. “Team Plexus for the win!” I chuckle inside my head, because I have difficulty controlling my stupid thoughts.Meanwhile, Jhamat is having trouble controlling the lights. They are meant to move through the spectrum, but are stuck on the green of the heart chakra. She is talking about the blue of the throat, the purple of the crown, but it doesn’t match the mossy light filling the room. It is like being inside a faulty traffic light. Imagine if all traffic lights were stuck on green, I think, struggling to focus on “the indigo of my third eye”. That would be the same as having no traffic lights. I see cars piling up on one another twisted metal. This is not the class’s intended effect.I peek to see Jhamat fiddling with the control box, then turning one of the light panels off and on, then giving up. I feel for her. She continues to talk to the class in a measured way, as if nothing is wrong. Behind me, someone is snoring. It has been an excellent yoga class, followed by a strange meditation experience with some gorgeous nu-rave colours. But I am not sure how much can be said for Spectrum, at least when the equipment isn’t working properly. I am not convinced. Perhaps someone greenlit this too soon.Studies have indicated that if we got rid of traffic lights, there would be fewer accidents.Yellow? Is it me you’re looking for?

For instance, even if a graduate paid off their loan in November, automatic payments could continue to be deducted from their salary for the rest of the tax year.The biggest annual amount not refunded was from 2015-16, with £6.3m of overpayments not yet paid back. From 2016-17, £5.9m of overpayments were still outstanding, the BBC reported.A government spokesman said steps had been taken to help avoid overpayments in the future. “This included changing the law in April to allow weekly data sharing between HMRC and the Student Loans Company, which will help to prevent graduates repaying too much,” he said. “If a borrower believes there has been an over-repayment, they should contact the SLC to seek a refund.”Last year, the SLC was accused of spying on vulnerable students’ social media accounts during an anti-fraud campaign which caused some people to lose funding and drop out of university despite having done nothing wrong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99c47a423bfe1385096770f4b114b4549d98920a/0_37_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=932d48132ebf875cbd343fa5aa0001a1","title":"all female music festival lineups native loud women fest boudica hearher","story":"Major music festivals such as Reading and Leeds continue to feature mostly male artists, but a number of events are fighting back by removing men from the billing altogetherIn 2015, music blog Crack in the Road tweeted a doctored image of the poster for the Reading and Leeds festival, erasing all acts that didn’t include a female performer. Only 10 groups remained. It started a conversation about gender inequality at music festivals – an issue that, despite the outcry, persists in 2019. This weekend’s edition of Reading and Leeds features only one female performer, Billie Eilish, among the festival’s 11 top-billed acts. Scotland’s TRNSMT and metal festival Download each had only one act featuring women across their nine lead acts, while there are no female headliners at indie festivals Green Man and End of the Road.At this year’s Glastonbury, despite the presence of Janet Jackson, Kylie, Lauryn Hill and Miley Cyrus lower down the bill, the Pyramid stage headliners were all male. “The pool isn’t big enough,” said organiser Emily Eavis. “It’s time to nurture female talent. Everyone wants it, everyone’s hungry for women, but they’re just not there.”This year, a number of festival organisers are attempting to redress the issue by having only women on stage. Those with all-female lineups include Native festival in Kent, Loud Women Fest in north London, and Boudica festival in Coventry. KT Tunstall has launched a festival called HearHer, which will feature a programme comprising female solo artists or women-fronted bands and women will run the behind-the-scenes production. On the west coast of the US, there’s California Women’s Music and Women Sound Off meanwhile, Brandi Carlile, the Americana star who won three Grammys this year, will bring back her Girls Just Wanna Weekend to Mexico in January 2020.Angela Martin – co-founder of Cro Cro Land, a female-organised festival in south London where the lineup and crew have a 5050 gender balance – puts the boom in such festivals down to “unrest among women in music”. This, she says, leads to an increase in female promoters creating their own events.She cites the PRS Foundation’s Keychange initiative as a catalyst in raising awareness about gender inequality at festivals. The campaign encourages festivals to have a 5050 gender split among performers by 2022. More than 150 events worldwide have pledged to hit this target, including the Proms, Bluedot and Standon Calling.The mastermind behind Keychange, Vanessa Reed, said the rise in all-female lineups this year was a necessary phase to help redress the balance. “People are feeling frustrated by festival lineups being male-dominated. Until Keychange there was no big debate about this or positive action. Some places, as an act of defiance, are saying: we are going to book loads of female talent in our city.”Others put the rise down to politics, including the #MeToo movement that took off in the wake of sexual assault and rape allegations made against the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. Reed mentions Statement festival in Sweden, which had an all-female lineup and an all-female audience, too. (It was later successfully sued for discrimination.) “That was set up for a different reason, specifically in response to incidents of sexual harassment – they wanted to make a statement.”Victoria Boyington founded California Women’s Music festival in 2014 because promoters were not booking enough women. In the last year, she says there has been an “insurgence of feminism and the feminist movement”. She believes the trend may have peaked, and that it is a sign of change when bigger corporations jump on the bandwagon. She points to US radio conglomerate iHeartRadio and its all-female Women Who Rock concert for International Women’s Day, which featured artists including St Vincent and Karen O. “The future won’t necessarily be all-female lineups, but more inclusive festival lineups for major festivals.”However, Boyington says some bookers lack integrity, booking women simply as a marketing ploy. “I am not sure they have the same focus as our organisation, which is more grassroots and founded by women for women.”Reed says the next step is to establish gender equality more deeply through the festival industry. “There are still so many male promoters and bookers and established networks that have traditionally booked more men than women. All those things mean it’s harder to instigate change. But I have been inspired by the fact that lots of younger men in the music industry are as keen as women are for programmes to be more balanced. So I hope to some degree it’s about generational change.”Change is certainly happening – Barcelona’s Primavera festival, one of the biggest music festivals in Europe, offered a 5050 gender split in its 2019 lineup. “With loads of great music made by women, the paradigm of what we understood as ‘headliners’ until now is changing,” organiser Marta Pallarès wrote in Loud and Quiet magazine. “Music shouldn’t be the ‘pale, male and stale’ playground any more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a31bff79e396c332e083fa485592302f777f9b9/0_1725_5714_3427/master/5714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=331ef7dbd7b110731340c49e66263d00","title":"shura aleksandra denton forevher touch nothings real","story":"When the British electropop singer went from viral triumph to being dropped by her label, she found fearless creativity and new love in New YorkIn 2014, Shura uploaded a song to SoundCloud on a whim. Refreshing her phone during breaks at her old job at a post-production company, she gawped at what she saw. The track, Touch, surged in popularity, and Shura – real name Aleksandra Denton – decided to film a video on a shoestring budget, blowing most of it on smoke bombs. The video features a procession of couples of various genders kissing in a haze of lilac. This also went viral, with views spiralling quickly into the millions. The momentum didn’t slow: she was nominated for the BBC’s Sound of … shortlist at the end of the year, and signed a record deal with Polydor.“It was like getting undressed in front of people!” Shura says when we meet in her old hometown of Shepherd’s Bush, London, reflecting on the pressures of making a debut album under the world’s gaze. She sips black coffee and puffs on a vape as we talk, hiding under a white baseball cap nicked from her own merch stand. “It’s no coincidence that the first panic attack I’ve ever had in my life was during the making of my first record.” The New York Times said the result, Nothing’s Real, approached “something like perfection”. “It was a really strange experience to go from being a nobody to a semi-somebody,” she says. Then her relationship broke down, crumbling under the strain of a relentless touring schedule. “It couldn’t handle the shift,” she shrugs.Love aside, Shura achieved more success than she had ever dreamed of. As time went on, however, she began to grow anxious about how she slotted into the glossy major-label world. “I’m never going to have another Touch,” she says. “That was just a magic moment. When you have a viral video that you made yourself, with a budget of 900 quid, it puts you in a good position to be like, ‘I know what I’m doing.’ Even if you don’t.” Her album peaked at No 13, then disappeared, spending only two weeks in the UK chart. “I was frightened I would lose my leverage because, by the label’s standards, Nothing’s Real wasn’t a roaring success. By mine, it was.”She was relieved when Polydor dropped her. “It’s like when you’re in a slightly shit relationship,” she jokes. “I got myself dumped.” But stepping away gave her an opportunity to get on with living life unwatched: no more pressure to keep the hype machine fuelled. “I feel like if I had stayed on a major label, I would’ve needed to carry on putting out things,” she says. “Whether it was me singing on someone else’s track, or appearing somewhere, at some event. Doing all these things to remind people you exist. I felt like the most sane thing I could do for myself was to be quiet until I had something to say.”Now signed to the indie label Secretly Canadian, being the sort of pop star who passes slightly under the radar suits Shura more than the prospect of arena tours and big co-signs. “I’m thrilled to be in a place where I’m walking past posters of all the records I bought and loved that year: Bon Iver, Angel Olsen, Japanese Breakfast, Mitski, Moses Sumney. I feel like I’m part of this weird family.”She has recently moved to the States. Why? “Bodegas,” she deadpans, referring to those Aladdin’s cave delis you get in New York. “I’m just obsessed. If you went to a newsagent’s here, you’d get maybe a Tropicana, if you’re lucky.” It’s not the whole story: after two years of touring her debut, Shura was exhausted and homesick. Still, before catching a flight home, she made a brief detour to Minneapolis, where she holed up to write new material and drink white Russians. It was here she fired up a dating app and swiped right on her now girlfriend, who lives in New York.While debut Nothing’s Real veiled uncertainty, insecurity and debilitating anxiety inside glimmering, pop-shaped Trojan horses, its successor emits the pure blue warmth of its cover image, despite the turmoil in her new home country. “It’s been very weird to have America as the backdrop to a love affair,” she says. “It’s a queer love story, with the backdrop of the US at its most horrific.” Accordingly, Forevher’s love songs are warped and strange, filled with classic, old-timey melodies. Though Shura doesn’t share the acrobatic strut of some of her biggest influences – Whitney Houston and Patrice Rushen, to name two – Forevher leans heavily into soul, her unembellished vocal exposed. “Piano in major sevenths, or traditionally jazzy chords borrowed from soul records – that’s something I would’ve been allergic to in the past,” she says. “Well, not allergic, but afraid.”In essence, she strove to write a traditional love record, with an ambiguous, queered slant. “Taking a classic image and twisting it,” she says. “So much of pop is geared towards straight desire that queer fans continually make small, mental adjustments to create space for their experiences in the mainstream. We’re so used to doing that. It’s in our programming.” With Forevher, she wondered whether it was possible to do it the other way around. “Would straight people find it as easy to do the same? I’m guessing probably not. Also, maybe they would?”But the tide is beginning to turn, thanks to a wave of queer artists pouring into the mainstream. Record labels are eager to associate with queer culture. Though she’s not experienced it, Shura finds herself sceptical of marketing teams seizing on sexuality as a selling point. “It would be really nice to get to a place where we don’t need to write in a press release, ‘Queer person does … ’” she says. “It’s OK to be overtly queer. One of the best things about queer culture is overtness. But I would love more room for incidental queerness.”At her new label, Shura is enjoying the opportunity to ask all of these questions. “Musicians are often reduced to the lowest common denominator in general,” she shrugs.If Nothing’s Real was pegged as an album about “being a queer woman in London”, now Shura will be “the person with fancy hats,” she announces, looking pleased, and referring to her new stage gear – a wide-brimmed number in Yves Klein blue. “It was really funny thinking about the amount of times Polydor had told me to dress up, front and centre and be a pop star.”And so, of course, for her first video on an indie label, she’s dressing up in a fancy costume – lesbian pope, is how she bills it – “and standing there vaping, pretending to be a pop star,” she laughs. “Well, being a pop star.” She pauses and revises her thought. “I have no expectations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09207a264307bca88a140e71da3acadcc5bec12/82_277_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f55c39173c68e9ad9f2081c4f0d0316","title":"detention of muslims at uk ports and airports structural islamophobia","story":"Dossier by Cage attacks ‘suspicionless stops’ under anti-terror laws and highlights minuscule rate of convictionsMuslims are being detained at ports and airports for up to six hours by law enforcement using controversial counter-terrorism powers so disproportionately that the practice has become Islamophobic, according to human rights group Cage.Cage said it had made a compliant to the policing regulator, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, on behalf of 10 people, and had written to MPs on the all-party group on British Muslims to spell out the extent of its concerns with so-called schedule 7 stops.In the letter, Adnan Siddiqui, the director of Cage, said that tens of thousands of people were being subject to “suspicionless stops” and that “the practice is a manifestation of structural Islamophobia, which is experienced as harassment”.One Briton, Omer, who asked only to be identified by his first name, told the  he had been stopped 40 times when returning to the UK since 2005 but has never been convicted of any offence.A former medical professional, Omer was stopped at Heathrow returning from Lahore, Pakistan, after a flight in which he had helped a teenager having a fit. But on leaving the plane he was nevertheless questioned. “This is a law that is almost impossible to beat.”Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows people to be detained at the border for up to six hours if law enforcement is concerned they could be engaged in terrorist activities. Detainees have no right to silence, must surrender their phones, computers and passwords and provide fingerprints and DNA on request.Cage has complied a dossier summarising its complaints about schedule 7, which is partly based on a string of case studies it has compiled. Siddiqui said that the organisation had noticed that recently “a number of Muslim women had been asked to remove their hijab at a schedule 7 stop”.In his letter to the MPs, Cage’s director added: “This request seems not to correlate with any appropriate investigation in relation to any form of terrorism, but seems to be a form of humiliation which can amount to a breach of equalities legislation.”A woman returning from Mecca was stopped and held at an airport for five hours, according to the Cage dossier, despite having felt unwell on the plane. She was separated from her husband and son, asked for fingerprints, a DNA sample, her luggage was searched and her phone taken.The woman asked what she thought about the 2017 Westminster terror attack, and wars in Syria and Yemen. “I said I didn’t agree with killing innocent people,” she recalled, before being released, having been told “you have complied with the laws”.Muslims stopped say that questions frequently focus on their religious beliefs, and they are asked if they pray frequently, if they fast and if they have been to Mecca.“The whole thing is done in such a way as to make you feel that you are doing something wrong for simply practising Islam,” said a filmmaker who had previously worked for aid organisations in Syria but on this occasion was travelling to Amsterdam via Dover.Muhammad Rabbani, Cage’s international director, said: “The discrimination faced by Muslim travellers highlights how embedded Islamophobia is in schedule 7, and in broader counter-terrorism powers. Officers routinely ask intrusive questions about religion and practice, which amounts to a modern-day inquisition.”Figures relating to the use of schedule 7 only date back to 2010, but show there have been 419,472 stops since then. In the year to March 2019, 11,1154 stops were conducted, down from 85,000 in the year to March 2010.David Miranda, the partner of former  journalist Glenn Greenwald, was controversially detained at Heathrow airport under the counter-terrorism power in 2013 for carrying files relating to information obtained by US whistleblower Edward Snowden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39d4d8d46b8e15c29411da9981b47f4b30d2217/69_117_3381_2028/master/3381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9571686bb46745cecaaa4ee2872bcfc","title":"the monster to slay before domestic policies is brexit readers on corbyns speech","story":"You have been reacting in the comments to Jeremy Corbyn’s speech on Labour’s vision to rebuild BritainYes Jeremy, I agree.

Corbyn’s priority must be to stop any possibility of a no-deal Brexit – then to stop any form of Brexit. Even a soft Brexit with a deal will leave us worse off. He must be prepared to stand aside to allow someone else who can command a majority to become caretaker PM. It will only be a temporary position until Brexit is resolved and a general election is called. Then he can come back as Labour leader and fight that election. pocclondonAs a Labour member, its excruciating (and embarrassing) to watch Corbyn flail about like this. I’m entirely on board with our domestic policy program under Corbyn but he is never ever going to win a general election. His main appeal was the honesty and consistency which marked him out as different. Now he doesn’t even have that after pretending to campaign for Remain (i.e. disappearing) when everyone knows he loathes the EU. We’re heading for a no deal Brexit and it will be Labour’s fault. Mark ForresterSadly Corbyn is still pushing for a GE as the solution rather than a people’s vote. It looks as if he is walking straight into Johnson’s trap as the latter will be able to set the election date in his own favour. Brexit for the Tories will be more than enough to wipe out Labour. It’ll happen before the country has woken to the chaos of Brexit. Corbyn should never give Johnson what he wants – a GE, before it’s obvious to the country that his Government is sunk in Brexit chaos and exuding incompetence from every pore. FogintheChannelGreat rhetoric Corbyn. But surely the monster to tackle right now, right here, is Brexit. That is the monster to slay before domestic policies. Brexit has to be lanced first. Or can you tell us how your Brexit is going to benefit anyone? solitarybeehiveSo it seems few people understand what this position means. Labour being neutral means it will not force one position or another on their MPs who will be free to campaign and vote as they see fit. Despite what most people here seem to think, the country is still split and the only way forward is to have an open and honest conversation about it. Labour is a broad church, its voters are split over this and acting like that isn’t the case is not helpful. Taking a neutral stance allows the party to debate this on its own merits (or none) and then for everyone to vote with their own conscience. It is the only party that can and has tried to actually unite the country. KingInTheNorthPissing into the wind on Brexit again Jezza. I voted for you. I support fully the economic and social approach you and McDonnell have taken. But you have to fight the enemy in front of you. And that enemy is Brexit. You missed the point and consigned us to right wing extremist hell. Thanks. SequinnerSound strategy to remain neutral at the next referendum. The great thing is that Labour doesn’t need to come off the fence to win at the next GE and gain the remain vote. All Labour needs to do is offer a second referendum in its general election manifesto with the option to remain included in it. Anyone slightly remain inclined who is thinking rationally and wants to stop Brexit, would still vote for Labour if they offered a second referendum in it’s GE manifesto, regardless of whether Labour comes out fully in support of Remain as a party.Given all the above, and given the serious damage of a split in the Labour vote by backing remain unequivocally, it’s very hard to see how Labour will suffer from continuing on with constructive ambiguity while throwing its weight behind a second referendum vacuousCorbyn is right to note that the problems faced by the UK run much deeper than Brexit which is, after all, a symptom of those problems. Having said that, any form of Brexit that removes citizenship and rights from millions of people without their consent will compound the problems we face, not cure any of them. DJT1MillionCorbyn and the Labour leadership just don’t seem to understand that until Brexit is resolved one way or another, everything else is on the back burner. They can’t simply sit this out and hope it goes away – rightly or wrongly, it’s currently the number one issue and it needs decisive leadership to get past it. Adrianh2017Corbyn is correct - not spectacular, not catchy, not quotable, just correct. The general public are being excluded from the wealth flowing to a small fraction of the population. A step change is needed to address this. So much is wrong and so much has been deliberately broken over the last 40 years that there is no guarantee a new direction exists that will lead to prosperity for all. But unless you try nothing will change. WallyGnatSpot on Jez. Britain’s problems do lie far deeper than Brexit. The disconnected mentality of people who rail against Corbyn while not comprehending why Brexit happened is incredible. They’ll vote against Labour because red Ed ate his sandwich in a funny way and because they can’t trust the government with more taxes and then blink dumbfoundedly with an uncomprehending gaze when things continue to get worse and fall apart around them. vacuousGot to be honest, not a massive Corbyn fan, but he’s right on this one. It’s not about remain vs leave, we need to reunite the country and end the austerity that got us here in the first place. saxonwhittle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Marnus Labuschagne came into the XI and, while he too was struck on the grille by Archer second ball, a resolute 59 from the right-hander helped deny England victory on the final afternoon.Smith, whose twin centuries at Edgbaston the week before had helped set up a 1-0 lead for the tourists, admitted on Sunday he would need to have cleared all tests and be training two days out from the third Test to stand any chance of being selected.But on Tuesday he was a bystander at practice before Justin Langer, the Australia coach, confirmed Smith would not be ready in time.Britain’s sports minister, Nigel Adams, has condemned England cricket fans who have been booing Smith, calling their behaviour “distasteful” and saying it is time for the jeering to stop.Smith and his teammates David Warner and Cameron Bancroft have been roundly heckled during the Ashes series for their involvement in the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year, for which Smith and Warner received 12-month bans and Bancroft a nine-month suspension.Adams on Monday joined a chorus of condemnation aimed in particular at England fans who booed Smith when he returned to the crease to resume batting at Lord’s on Saturday.“The vast majority of the Lord’s crowd were on their feet applauding Steve Smith after his innings but a small amount of booing from a tiny element of the crowd has made the news,” Adams told the Sydney Morning Herald.“It’s distasteful and we have to remember the Aussie players who got themselves into trouble have been punished and done the time. Smith, in particular, is a brilliant batsman and while I don’t want him getting too many runs while he’s over here, he’s mesmerising to watch and as sports fans we should be applauding him, not jeering.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91b63449949ff2aed16370a3ec4d1d763887117c/0_0_1541_925/master/1541.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=951d1a367ecb5b0f71d1e5d8dfd36bee","title":"pavel florin the spin cricket england espionage","story":"The Romanian bowler received VIP treatment at Lord’s, but the drive to grow cricket in Romania and Europe needs attentionPresumably, these days, there is some sort of support group for those who have become overnight internet sensations. Somewhere someone who accidentally invented a new dance move, or tasered their own foot, can go for advice, solace, group counselling. A closed Facebook group where Fenton’s owner or Hot Mugshot Guy warn newcomers of the things no viral superstar realises – for instance, that life might get unexpectedly expensive.Romania’s cricketer extraordinaire, Pavel Florin, has learned the hard way. Standing in the President’s Box at the Lord’s Ashes Test this weekend, as a cluster of surrounding dignitaries were topped up with champagne, his shoes shone with fresh-from-the-box lustre. When he left his home city of Cluj-Napoca, he hadn’t expected to be invited to the zenith of cricket’s social season. He certainly hadn’t packed for it.“It was only one day ago I heard I would be coming here,” says Florin, decked in a petrol blue jacket. “I’m a sportsman, I don’t usually wear these clothes. So I needed to buy them!” He looks down at the Prince of Wales check on his new trousers. “I don’t even know if they work.” They do. Florin looks distinctly natty against an assembly of cream linen and egg-and-bacon.It’s hard to believe it’s less than three weeks since the world first discovered Florin, when the European Cricket League shot him to insta-fame. But then Florin went from infamy – “check out this Romanian guy’s bowling!” – to international treasure – “check out this Romanian guy, he’s bowling!” – in the space of a couple of overs. There were immediate offers, from people who claimed to know how he could capitalise on his moment in the spotlight. “Many agents came to me saying they I could do this or that and get some money,” says Florin. “But it wasn’t about the cricket.”Instead, he decided to spend his own cash to fly to England and find out how small clubs work here. If he’s going to use his profile, it will be to develop and improve the game in Romania. “This is why I came alone, I want to try to speak with people, and see how they manage.” He laughs. “This is espionage!”His spy mission has cost him €700 (£637) so far his job as a nightclub bouncer pays a monthly salary of €400. “But I’m the president of my club and I need to do this.” When he landed on Thursday, he tweeted his arrival with a selfie at Luton airport. “What do you do when you first arrive in London?” he asked. “Looking for a place to eat … looking for a place to sleep … but first … you are looking for a field to throw a ball.” Florin was immediately inundated with offers of games and net sessions, not to mention a spare room.Transylvania’s most famous all-rounder is both a reason to celebrate and a salutary lesson for the development of cricket in Europe, or indeed any small country with little history of the game. He’s an already-sporty type who got involved when he was training and saw some Indians practising in the field next to him. They gave him a hit and, always keen to recruit new talent, told him he was a great player – the future captain of Romania. “It was a lie, because someone caught the ball,” says Florin. “But I liked this lie.”Now he travels 500km to his nearest ground to play, and cricket is his first thought on waking up every morning (“my life is very easy, because I’m not married”). But, as Florin is aware, passion isn’t enough, not in a country where the police see you carrying a long-handled wooden bat and assume you’re planning to assault someone. Anyone else might well have given up by now. “For six years, I couldn’t bat or bowl in our games, just field,” he says. “My team want to win when they play, and they said you are not good enough yet – you have to get better. And it was true!”At the time, Florin was one of only two Romanians in his side (there are now three). As the now-president of his club, he points out that the expansion of the game among Romanian nationals has never been part of the agenda, since it was created for a community of expats who would be leaving when their work contracts were over. “Those people just want to play, which is fine,” he says. “They play and go home and play and go home. But I’m just one person. I can’t do this on my own.”This was the week European cricket was meant to get flashy. The Euro T20 Slam, in which stars such as Eoin Morgan, Babar Azam and Faf du Plessis would have turned out for city-based franchises in Dublin, Amsterdam and Edinburgh, should have been gearing up for its first round of games. Instead, the tournament was cancelled due to “unforeseen circumstances” and the organisers announced that they had “reluctantly come to the decision that staging of the event will not be possible” this year. In one of the company’s other ventures – the Global T20 Canada League – players including Yuvraj Singh had gone on strike due to non-payment of wages.Instead, the cricket story that has turned our head has come from a country whose federation currently consists of a mere eight clubs. So what next for Romania? Having witnessed futsal’s dramatic increase in popularity when a new prize tournament was introduced, Florin believes that the club scene needs a rethink, and the International Cricket Council needs “another approach”. As for the national team – which he started playing for two years ago – he wants new opposition. “We need to play with strong teams,” says Florin. “We beat Russia, Turkey, Bulgaria, but we’re hungry for more.”That, he believes, is the way to raise the profile of the game in his country, and inspire fresh talent. “My nation don’t have a hero,” he says. They certainly have a champion.

While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

The main draw is its programme of spoken-word performances, most of which take place in its 100-seat basement theatre. The storytelling doesn’t just happen on stage, though. The ground floor has a large, airy room used for exhibitions, workshops and open-mic events, as well as a monthly story session for tots (Tiny Tales for one- to three-year-olds). Pre-show, my kids had a fun 20-minutes opening lots of wee doors and peering through lots of wee windows that form part of the room’s interactive story wall.Animal names in Scots (one of the three official languages in Scotland) sound as though they were invented just for enlivening stories. My favourites include forty-fittit Janet (centipede), spinnie jenny (daddy-longlegs) and pis(h)-minnie (ant).The live performances. We caught the 4pm showing of The Man Who Planted Trees (on until 26 August). An adaptation of the 1953 allegorical work of French writer Jean Giono, the tale centres on the efforts of a local shepherd to reforest a windswept corner of Provence. Presented as a comediannarrator double act, the hour-long play exemplified performative storytelling at its best: poignant, honest and packed with giggles. Check the events listing for other upcoming kids’ shows. The centre will also host the Scottish International Storytelling Festival (18-31 October)There’s a cafe on the ground floor with a lengthy list of sandwiches, panini, filled croissants and salads. Soups and lunchtime specials (£7.50) change on a daily basis. Get there before 12.30pm and you can try The Storyteller’s Breakfast (£10.50), which adds lorne sausages (they’re square), a tattie scone and a slice of black haggis to a regulation fry-up. A children’s no-haggis version is also available (£8.50).No gift shop! Better than that, the centre boasts an independent bookshop, which specialises in fables, myths and folk stories. Many are classics passed down from generation to generation, although contemporary material also abounds. Kids’ books are plentiful. Contemporary highlights include Lari Don’s Serpents and Werewolves and Janis Mackay’s The Selkie Girl. Also worth a look is Animals, Beasties and Monsters of Scotland by Lea Taylor, which forms part of History Press’s superb compilation of regional Scottish folk stories. For budding linguists, there are Scots’ versions of Harry Potter, as well as Roald Dahl’s The Twits (“Eejits”).The centre is in the middle of Edinburgh’s Old Town, at the eastern end of the Royal Mile. It’s a five-minute walk from Waverley railway station. Driving in the city centre is to be avoided the nearest bus stops are on the High Street and North Bridge. For more information visit Lothian Buses.Reasonable. Entry to the ground-floor space is free, although all the theatre performances are ticketed. Prices for shows vary, with the average around £8 for adults and £6 for children. Café Voices, the centre’s monthly storytelling night, is £5.10am-6pm Monday-Saturday Sunday (July and August only). Last entry: 5.30pm.1010. This joyful, noisy, energy-filled space brims with a love of live storytelling and its power to make us think and imagine. My two boys (10 and 11) loved every minute, giving it an 1110 – suggesting an incipient appreciation for the magical, reality-bending properties of great storytelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b23ec1d7142349936a4209f13d94eb4d5edb5e4a/510_0_4717_2830/master/4717.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c4ed124d8111f52cea26829003270e3","title":"love island ovie soko young black people need know they can be themselves","story":"He was the breakout star of this summer’s series – an ally of women, with refreshingly goofy charm. But that doesn’t mean the 28-year-old’s mum has stopped checking up on himIn a corner office in ITV’s headquarters in central London, the former Love Island contestant Ovie Soko is about to be embarrassed by his mum, Foluso. The pair have recently been on This Morning, cooking Eamonn Holmes’s breakfast live on air, completing the promotional duties of any successful reality TV star. But now, as his dad, Ray, quietly eats a supermarket sandwich, the dirt is about to be dished.“He talks about himself in the third person,” says Foluso.“I’ve never done that,” counters Soko, quickly regressing from 6ft 7in (2-metre) professional basketball player and composed TV personality to annoyed teenager.“You’d come in and say: ‘What will Ovie have for lunch today?’ Is that not the third person?” adds Foluso, doubling down.Ray joins in. “He’d come back from training and say: ‘What is Ovie having for lunch?’”The son remains silent, beaten by a parental tag team in perfect harmony. “I’ll record you and put it on Instagram next time,” adds his mum, for good measure.It is rare to see Soko flustered. After all, he made a name for himself on a show where “flustered” has probably been used only as a wry sexual euphemism: Soko is the standout star from this year’s Love Island, the Marmite reality TV show in which young people with no tops on try ostensibly to “find love” and, more accurately, “build a brand” from which to launch lucrative deals after filming ends. Soko, a late entry to the competition (he entered the villa in the fourth week), arguably did both: romantic love, possibly, with his fellow contestant India Reynolds (who he is still in a relationship with) platonic love, definitely, with Amber Gill, who eventually won the show with her rugby player partner Greg O’Shea. The Ovie brand, meanwhile, is a work in progress as he considers a move from basketball into TV or fashion.So, what has surprised him the most since he left the Mallorcan hideaway at the end of July? “The love, man,” he says. “It’s overwhelming. It doesn’t make sense to me.”His newfound popularity will not be a surprise to anyone who watched the show. People like Soko are rarely seen on reality TV he doesn’t make sense in that context. In fact, they are rarely seen on TV at all. Self-assured without being cocky, entertaining without being overbearing, paternal without being condescending – there was a laconic and disarming ease to everything he did while in the villa.The attention he has received since leaving the villa is “great”, he says. “It makes you feel good, but at the same time it was just me being myself day to day. It’s wild that that can reach so many people.”Part of the reason people fell in love with him was his protective nature. First of Gill – a loud, funny, fiercely loyal Geordie who went through a crushingly harsh breakup with this year’s pantomime villain, Michael Griffiths – and then of Reynolds, whom he extricated from an explosive argument between fracturing couple Anna Vakili and Jordan Hames, extending his hand to her and leading her calmly from the fray.Another thing that doesn’t make sense in the context of reality TV is why Soko entered the villa in the first place. He was a successful professional basketball player, signed by CB Murcia in Spain’s top ision, the most respected league outside the NBA. He had worked towards a professional career from the age of 13, leaving home in north London at 16 to attend a private school in Virginia, to which he had won a scholarship. After three years of university – first in Alabama, then Pennsylvania – he missed out in the 2014 NBA draft, although Golden State Warriors were initially interested in him. So why did he put himself through a notoriously brutal British reality show?“On a basic level, it was my brother,” says Soko. “It was a passing comment. He said: ‘Ovie, you’d be sick on this show,’ when we were watching it last summer.” But there was also a need to distance himself from the sporting world. “This was an opportunity to be known outside of basketball and to say I’m more than just my sport.” He had also been seriously injured twice, which had got him thinking about his career prospects, while the death of a friend had made him think more existentially. “A close friend of mine passed away playing basketball. He had a heart attack in practice in Macedonia he was so far from home. That year, I did a lot of thinking there was a long time to collect my thoughts and reassess everything.” Knowing this, his zen-like appearance on Love Island makes much more sense.Some observers have claimed that Soko’s success is intertwined with his race (he is British-Nigerian). “It’s simple, really,” wrote Tobi Rachel Akingbade in Grazia. “It starts with the fact that we only get one Ovie per generation … black men are rarely presented without a tinge of negativity or damaging hypermasculinity.” Soko is careful and considered when discussing the subject of reality TV and race, and how black people are rarely successful on shows on which the public can vote – take Alexandra Burke on Strictly. “Being a young black man is something in life that’s on your mind,” he says, before pausing for a few seconds. “It’s a weird one. It’s important for young black people to know that they can be themselves and you don’t have to fit into a specific mould to be one on TV.“If there’s one thing I hope it did show, it’s that being you is dope. Being original and being yourself is cool. If you’re one of one, think about how valuable that is. Every single person – regardless of race, colour, gender – is one of one. Now that is some valuable shit. Excuse me.”Growing up in Tottenham in a tight family unit of mum, dad and older brother Raymond, Soko believes his worldview was shaped by being exposed to art via his father, who made large-scale mixed-media work in his home studio. “Even from that early age, I saw things differently,” he says. He didn’t do well at school, where he struggled to adapt to rigid ideas around learning. “I was mischievous,” he says. His mum says she gave him the nickname Motorola because he used to talk so much as a child.“I would question everything, and I feel like they teach you not to question stuff. It’s backwards to me. Since nursery, you’re taught to do things a certain way and not think for yourself,” he says, before launching into a metaphor about colouring that I get lost in. “Think about kids who use colouring books,” he begins. “They’re told to colour and ‘stay inside of the lines’, but what is that really saying to you? What lines are you talking about? Because the border of the pages could be seen as the lines, but they’d say you were wrong if you did that.”Soko’s outlook on life is influenced by a heady mix of seemingly incompatible things. There are his parents and big brother, whom he clearly reveres. The church (“Sunday was church day there was no Sunday football for me”). “Do you know ET, Eric Thomas?” he asks. “The motivational speaker? He’s huge. I listen to a lot of investors’ podcasts.

It combines to create a worldview rooted in live and let live, minding your own business and believing in yourself.Soko’s parents have been sitting respectfully in near-total silence throughout the interview, while making their way through a bag of snacks. But now their son wants to settle the score. “My mum creeps on my Instagram and checks on all my stories,” Soko says, bowed but not broken after the earlier dusting down from his parents. “When I got back from dinner with India, Amber and Greg, my mum was like: ‘I know where you went.’”“I had to check on you,” she says.“Just allow it. If you know, I don’t need to know that you know. I’m 28!

We rank the bakers about to enter the tent, and predict the winner! Another year, another series of the Great British Bake Off. You know the deal by now. There’s a tent full of passionate home bakers, and week by week their will to live will be slowly eroded by impossible challenges that ask them to explain the quantum concept of particle-wave duality via the medium of biscuits.The new series of Bake Off begins next week, and it will be identical to every other series of Bake Off, and the only variation will be the influx of new contestants, so let’s rank them in terms of potential from worst to best.There’s a very good chance that Dan is a lovely person. However, between his deep-V shirt, his unguarded beard and his manbun, I am terrified of how much he’s going to shed into his food. Prue Leith is pushing 80, for crying out loud. A clump of hair in a Victoria sponge might finish her off.Although Rosie routinely performs life-saving surgery on sick animals, something about her demeanour here suggests she deals badly with stress. My guess is that she’ll be escorted from the tent after a fortnight for flinging a pan of boiling sugar at Sandi Toksvig’s head.Jamie looks a bit like a young Joaquin Phoenix. But ask yourself this: what would you do if Joaquin Phoenix gave you a cake? That’s right, you’d throw the cake away and set fire to the bin. It only seems sensible to do this with any cake given to you by this man too.No. No. Absolutely not. Let’s just study this picture for a moment. Not only is Michael’s apron absolutely filthy, but he’s also pulling the most terrified facial expression I have ever seen. This man is a complete danger. He has no discipline. He’s going to kill someone.In the press kit that accompanied the images of the new contestants, Phil is asked about his happiest Bake Off experiences. He replies “Being minibussed into the site”. That’s his happiest experience. A minibus. The man is the walking manifestation of the concept of doom.Henry is appearing on the Great British Bake Off because he was a Great British Bake Off superfan as a child. The Great British Bake Off is now creating its own contestants, and this means that Henry is the GBBO equivalent of Big Brother’s Brian Belo, and this means he is not to be trusted.I don’t trust Steph either. In her contestant photo she has made a towering multi-tiered sponge, which seems impressive. But look closer. Those tiers are not tidy at all. She looks like she’s just dustpan-and-brushed a pile of crumbs together. She’s fooling nobody. You’re fooling nobody, Steph.Why are you making so many notes, Helena? WHY ARE YOU MAKING SO MANY NOTES? Are you collecting data on us? Are you going to sell our secrets to the Russians, Helena? Oh, you’re not actually making notes, you’re just painting some icing with a brush that looks like a pen. Still, I’ve got my eye on you.Michelle didn’t have a wedding cake. She’s a Great British Bake Off contestant and yet, on a day when tradition demands cake, she chose to shun cake. Michelle is clearly some sort of arch cake dissident, and my honest belief is that her one true aim is to destroy Bake Off from the inside out. In which case, I can only applaud her.Alice is so beautiful and wholesome that the BBC used a giant photograph of her when it ran a story about the new contestants. This means her progress will inevitably be derailed as bored viewers use social media to concoct a story about how she’s probably having an affair with Paul Hollywood. Same as it ever was.David has a very precise look, which quite frankly Dan could learn a thing or two about. He also invented a type of cake that villages in Malawi could steam over an open fire, which means he is already well-versed in international cake outreach. He is the closest thing to a Terminator this year’s batch of contestants can offer.In her contestant profile, Priya is asked who would be most surprised to learn that she had entered Bake Off. She replies “I have kept in touch with people from work,” which means that she’s left work. Why did she leave work? Because she won Bake Off, that’s why. My logic is watertight, and you may all congratulate me when this series ends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d66be301c66cd34e2d53f7ea0bcc371b96dc36d0/0_71_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6526c642b95884b0cf2bedbfc6f80c21","title":"ilhan omar rashida tlaib israel press conference","story":"Rashida Tlaib and Omar called decision to block their entry an attempt ‘to suppress our ability to do our jobs’ in press conferenceThe Minnesota representative Ilhan Omar called on her colleagues to visit Israel to prevent Donald Trump and the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, “succeed in hiding the cruel reality of the occupation from us”.Omar’s comments came to in an emotional press conference on Monday, following Israel’s decision last week to deny her and the Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib entry to the country amid pressure from Donald Trump. Omar called Israel’s decision to block the planned official visit “nothing less than an attempt by an ally of the United States to suppress our ability to do our jobs as elected officials” and questioned the billions of dollars in US aid to the country.“As legislators we have an obligation to see the reality there for ourselves,” Omar told reporters during a press conference at the Minnesota state house in St Paul on Monday. “So I would encourage my colleagues to visit. Meet with the people we were going to meet with, see the things we were going to see, hear the stories we were going to hear.”Omar said Israel’s decision was “not consistent with democracy” and not reflective of actions taken by an ally of the US.Israel is the top recipient of US foreign aid and the country has long enjoyed bipartisan support. But Israel’s decision to bar the congresswomen entry threatens to undermine those ties, especially at a time when Democrats are increasingly critical of Netanyahu and his close alliance with Trump.Tlaib likened the decision to a ban imposed on a member of Congress seeking entry to South Africa during apartheid in 1972.“History does have a habit of repeating itself,” Tlaib said. Omar later added that the difference between then and now was that the US government was promoting the ban as opposed to actively working to lift it.She added: “We must be asking, as Israel’s ally, that Netanyahu stop the expansion of settlements on Palestinian land and ensure full rights for Palestinians if we are to give them aid.”At the urging of Trump, Netanyahu denied entry to Omar and Tlaib, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, over their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS) for Palestinian rights.Israel later relented and said the Detroit-born Tlaib could visit her 90-year-old grandmother, who lives in the occupied West Bank, if she did not promote the international boycott of Israel. Tlaib initially agreed but, facing criticism from some Palestinian activists, she changed her mind and announced that she would not travel to the country under “these oppressive conditions meant to humiliate me”.Trump has tried to make Omar, Tlaib and the other half of the foursome known as “the Squad” – all popular progressive congresswomen of color – the face of the Democratic party.In a series of racist tweets, Trump told the lawmakers to “go back” to their home countries. All are US citizens, and only Omar was not born in the US.At the press conference, Tlaib tearfully described her decision not to make the trip after a late-night phone call with her family.“I think my grandmother said it beautifully when she said I’m her asfour. Asfour in Arabic means her bird. She said I’m her dream manifested. I am her free bird. So why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election rose her head up high?” Tlaib said, her voice cracking. She added: “We all decided as a family that I could not go until I was a free, American, United States congresswoman.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bbb3157b2565c2de217558a373bc4639fc1f226/90_0_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811dd944952eaec6b7d24522506b2f35","title":"russian china us missile test arms race","story":"Beijing urges US to ‘let go of cold war mentality’ after it fires nuclear-capable weaponRussia and China have said a new US missile test has heightened military tensions and risks triggering an arms race, weeks after Washington ended a cold-war-era weapons pact with Moscow.The US and Russia terminated the intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) treaty this month after accusing each other of violating the accord. Washington said the agreement also tied its hands in dealing with other powers such as China.The US defence department announced on Monday it had tested a type of ground-launched missile that was banned under the 1987 INF agreement, which limited the use of nuclear and conventional medium-range weapons.“The US has obviously taken a course towards escalation of military tensions. We won’t react to provocations,” Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told the state news agency Tass. “We will not allow ourselves to get drawn into a costly arms race.”Ryabkov said the test showed Washington had been working on such missiles long before its official withdrawal from the deal.In Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, said: “This measure from the US will trigger a new round of an arms race, leading to an escalation of military confrontation.”He said the test would have a “serious negative impact” on the international and regional security situation. The US should “let go of its cold war mentality” and “do more things that are conducive to … international and regional peace and tranquillity”, Geng added.The missile was launched from the US-Navy-controlled San Nicolas Island off the coast of California.Speaking in France on Monday, before news of the US test launch broke, Vladimir Putin said Russia would only deploy medium- or shorter-range missiles in response to similar moves by the US.“If the United States produces such offensive systems, we will also do so,” the Russian president said at a press conference before a meeting with the French leader, Emmanuel Macron.Moscow and Washington have long criticised the treaty but Putin said it was the US that had made the decision to “unilaterally” withdraw.The weapon tested on Sunday was a version of the nuclear-capable Tomahawk cruise missile. The ground-launched version of the Tomahawk was removed from service after the INF was ratified.This month the defence secretary, Mark Esper, said the US had begun work to develop mobile, conventional, ground-launched cruise and ballistic missile systems.“Now that we have withdrawn, the Department of Defense will fully pursue the development of these ground-launched conventional missiles as a prudent response to Russia’s actions,” he said.Esper confirmed the US was not embarking on a new arms race. “The traditional sense of an arms race has been in a nuclear context,” he said. “Right now, we don’t have plans to build nuclear-tipped INF-range weapons. It’s the Russians who have developed non-compliant likely, possibly, nuclear-tipped weapons.”The US launch came weeks after a deadly explosion at a Russian testing site, which western experts linked to Moscow’s attempts to develop a nuclear-powered missile.The blast killed five scientists and caused a spike in radiation levels, although Russian authorities have remained tightlipped on the nature of the explosion. US experts have said it could be linked to testing of the Burevestnik cruise missile, touted by Putin this year.The INF banned all land-based missiles that could travel between 310 and 3,400 miles (500 and 5,500km) in an effort to abolish the class of nuclear arms that then most threatened Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9efa6f95407b8fcaea76d20a4ef9d7ef00e5cebc/1_0_2499_1500/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0edff24a02d1d04172ae39ccb7a288","title":"asylum seekers crammed into cockroach infested accommodation home office","story":"‘Guest houses’ provided by Home Office contractor unfit for habitation, say lawyersHundreds of asylum seekers have been crammed into a network of “guest houses” provided by a Home Office contractor overrun by cockroaches, rats and mice, the  has learned.Lawyers shown footage recorded by the  – which reveals that families of four are sharing small double beds and are being crammed into spaces so small that they are barely able to walk around their rooms – said that the conditions could constitute statutory overcrowding and an environment unfit for human habitation.One lawyer branded the conditions “depraved” and accused the home secretary, Priti Patel, of being “slum landlord in chief”.The buildings of the Maharaja Guest House in Southall are infested with tens of thousands of cockroaches, which feed on the residents’ food. In one of the kitchens seen by the , more than 100 cockroaches scattered when just one cupboard was opened.The managers, Mylondonlets, advertise rooms priced from £40 per night. The company is paid by the Home Office’s accommodation contractor for Wales and the south of England, Clearsprings Ready Homes, to house asylum seekers. The MyLondonLets website says it is “working in partnership” with a number of councils including Ealing, where the properties seen by the  are located.The website appeals for new properties and states: “HMOs (houses in multiple occupation) are far more profitable to run than other types of residential lettings with rental incomes often two to three times those of single households.”But that profitability appears to come at a cost. Residents of the four buildings that constitute the Maharaja Guest House interviewed by the  say that rats gnaw through the plastic of bottles of cooking oil to drink the oil, while mothers reported infestations of mice and say that large rats run up their children’s legs and walk across their faces while they sleep.It is understood that there have been recurring issues with the property. The buildings were inspected earlier this year by UK visas and immigration (UKVI) and infestations were found. It was claimed that they had been cleared but UKVI has now scheduled new inspections.One mother of two said: “We are just breathing here, we are not living. The beds are not just where we sleep but our living room, our dining area, our laundry drying area and the study area for our children. The springs on the mattresses are oozing and they are full of bugs. The bed has become our whole world.”She said that the accommodation providers expected her two children, a girl and a boy, aged eight and nine, to share a bed.“I think the Home Office encourages this type of thing,” she said. “It’s all part of the hostile environment. It’s as if they’re sending a message to us saying: ‘if you can’t take it here go home’.”The rooms seen by the  are so overcrowded that typically an entire family’s living space is all but taken up by a double bed that they share. There is just one washing machine for hundreds of asylum seekers. A notice in the kitchen threatens anyone who leaves unwashed dishes in the sink with eviction. In some parts of the building up to 10 residents are expected to share one small bathroom.Outside the property, piles of rubbish constituting a fire risk are stacked up behind a gate.Conditions at the Maharaja Guest House have come to light at a time when the Home Office is implementing new accommodation contracts following criticism of previous arrangements. In its investigation into Home Office accommodation published in January 2017 the home affairs select committee found that the contracts were not working after finding many problems with vermin, unclean surroundings and inadequate support for vulnerable people. It branded some of the accommodation a disgrace and said it was shameful to place vulnerable people there.The Home Office is legally obliged to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers – most fall into this category. The department has just published a booklet for asylum seekers outlining what they can expect in their accommodation. According to the booklet “promoting your wellbeing” is a key priority.Asylum seekers are told they can expect a table, one dining chair, one armchair or sofa seat per person and reasonable access to laundry facilities. Those amenities did not appear to be generally available to residents in the accommodation seen by the . Asylum seekers use suitcases as wardrobes in the absence of sufficient storage space and to protect their belongings from cockroaches.Toufique Hossain of Duncan Lewis Solicitors said: “These conditions are depraved. The secretary of state is the slum landlord-in-chief. We are talking about deeply traumatised people. They have seen and experienced horrors that they will never shake. And here they are, in the United Kingdom, made to sleep with cockroaches. It is inhuman and degrading.”William Ford, a specialist housing solicitor at Osbornes Law, said the conditions were “very concerning”. While he said that it was typically difficult to enforce housing standards for asylum seekers, he added: “The conditions described are likely to breach environmental health legislation as well as statutory rules on overcrowding.”A second woman who has a baby and a seven-year-old is living in a small room. “We have had to go without heating or hot water for months at a time,” she said.A third woman said that she and her two daughters aged four and seven were all forced to share a small double bed in a room so small they can only manoeuvre themselves around the bed sideways. It is impossible for the girls to play in the room so they have to play in the dirty corridor or on a filthy staircase.A spokeswoman for Refugee Rights Europe, which has carried out research on poor standards in Home Office accommodation, said: “These findings are shocking … Worryingly, this does not appear to be an isolated incident. It is high time that the UK government take urgent steps to improve conditions.”A Home Office spokesperson said the department took the wellbeing of asylum seekers “extremely seriously”.“We demand the highest standards from our contractors and their accommodation,” they said. “Where there is any suggestion they are not meeting the terms of their contract we will take immediate action.”Ealing council, Clearsprings Ready Homes and MyLondonLets did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6ce9babda894c08daea2686ba5bc92d3fce7a7c/0_74_1442_865/master/1442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e9426fae3192ae0dfd0298d80f5534d","title":"cameroon anglophone separatist leader ayuk tabe handed life sentence","story":"Self-proclaimed president of ‘Ambazonia’ and nine followers convicted of charges including ‘terrorism and secession’A military court in Cameroon has handed a life sentence to the head of the country’s anglophone separatist movement, Julius Sisiku Ayuk Tabe, and nine of his followers, lawyers said.The 10 were convicted of charges including “terrorism and secession”, the state’s lawyer, Martin Luther Achet, told Agence France-Presse.The sentence was confirmed by a lawyer for the separatists, Joseph Fru, who condemned what he called a “parody of justice”.The defendants refused to recognise the right of the military tribunal in Yaoundé to try them. Their lawyers have yet to say whether they will file an appeal.Ayuk Tabe, a charismatic 54-year-old computer engineer by training, was the first self-proclaimed president of “Ambazonia” – a breakaway state declared in October 2017 in two English-speaking regions of the central African country.The government responded with a military crackdown.Attacks by both sides have left 1,850 dead, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) thinktank, while the UN says 530,000 people have fled their homes.English-speakers account for about a fifth of Cameroon’s population of 24 million, who are majority French-speaking. Anglophones are mainly concentrated in two western areas, the North-west and South-west regions, that were incorporated into the French-speaking state after the colonial era in Africa wound down six decades ago.Anglophones have chafed for years at perceived discrimination in education, law and economic opportunities at the hands of the francophone majority.Ayuk Tabe is part of the political branch of the separatist group that supports dialogue with President Paul Biya.But the influence of moderates waned in 2017 as Biya, who has been in power for 36 years, rejected demands for autonomy and radicals in the movement gained the ascendancy.In January 2018, Ayuk Tabe was arrested with 46 other separatists in the Nigerian capital Abuja.They were then handed over to Cameroon – a move that was ruled illegal by a Nigerian court in March this year.In late May, Ayuk Tabe said he was willing to take part in talks with the government, provided this took place abroad and the government released all who had been detained since the start of the anglophone crisis.Last month, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the security forces of committing “brazen crimes” against citizens, including unlawful killings and use of excessive force.The authorities, while rejecting general criticism, have acknowledged a small number of abuses.In June, the defence ministry said it would prosecute seven soldiers suspected of summarily killing two women and their two children, a video of which was distributed on the internet to widespread outrage.The unrest has crippled the economy of the North-west and South-west regions and had a knock-on effect across the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1ccf60e79a4e269007e1f5bf567ec62843f6cdb/0_0_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b6d12d825807d4a836a62ccf0d797d2","title":"delhi ex mps told to vacate lutyens bungalows","story":"About 200 grand bungalows in Lutyens zone are still occupied by former MPs They will not have their belongings thrown out on to the road – yet – but former Indian MPs who lost their seats at the last election have been told that if they fail to vacate their official bungalows within a week, the gas, electricity, and water will be cut off.About 200 grand bungalows in the heart of Delhi, part of an area built as the capital of the British Raj, are still occupied by ex-MPs who should have left the residences within a month of the last parliament being dissolved on 25 May.A parliamentary housing committee was forced to issue the stern warning as incoming MPs, keen to grab one of the nicest perks of the job, are currently living in rented accommodation, their suitcases packed and with nowhere to go.There are fewer places more pleasing to live in Delhi than the Lutyens zone, named after British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens who designed and built many of the official buildings during the Raj in the 1930s and 1940s. The zone includes almost 2,000 highly coveted bungalows, overwhelmingly held in state hands.The broad, leafy avenues here are lined with white colonial bungalows featuring porticoes and arches, high ceilings, spacious rooms, and forbidding perimeter walls. The quarters for the servants alone are vast and the gardens are the size of public parks. Some MPs and politicians have nevertheless remained illegal occupants for years and residents can go to great lengths to stay on. One favourite ruse is for the offspring of a dead MP or minister to turn the bungalow into a “memorial” to justify the family remaining in place. Others insist that security threats necessitate one of the well-appointed residences, while one option is just to wait for a forced removal.Payal Abdullah, the estranged wife of Kashmir politician Omar Abdullah, in 2013 refused to move out of the bungalow allotted to her husband, even though her husband was not even living in it. Three years later, a Delhi high court judge asked her: “Will you gracefully vacate or should I pass an order?” When she refused, the police forcibly evicted her.Mayawati, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, had to be served an eviction order last year before she grudgingly vacated it.A few politicians however are willing to move on. When the former finance minister Arun Jaitley asked Narendra Modi, the prime minister, to relieve him of his ministerial job on account of ill health, he could justifiably have stayed on in his official bungalow as a member of the upper house. But the moment he relinquished his post, he moved out.What the incoming MPs may find, though, is that the previous occupant showed scant regard for the architectural integrity of the bungalow. Over the years, MPs across the political spectrum have given many bungalows additions including plyboard partitions, sheds covered with corrugated plastic and extra toilets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c208eaabb211863fef64e56fd610b22df756afb/71_0_722_433/master/722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5688a2f830e1f9d5601886e758ef474e","title":"employee at uk consulate in hong kong detained in china","story":"Detention comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong An employee at the UK’s consulate in Hong Kong has been detained by mainland Chinese authorities on his way back to the city, his girlfriend has said.Simon Cheng, 28, was returning from a trip in Shenzhen to his native Hong Kong on 8 August when his girlfriend, Li, stopped receiving communications from him.A spokesman for the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: “We are extremely concerned by reports that a member of our team has been detained returning to Hong Kong from Shenzhen … We are providing support to his family and seeking further information from authorities in Guangdong province and Hong Kong.”Li said Cheng had messaged her just before he went silent. “Ready to pass through the border … pray for me,” he had written.More than 10 days later, Li and Cheng’s family have not been able to get in touch with him. Li said Hong Kong immigration authorities had told her Cheng had been placed under “administrative detention” in mainland China in an unknown location and for unknown reasons.The detention of Cheng, who works in the British consulate as a trade and investment officer for Scottish Development International, comes amid more than two months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have threatened Beijing’s authority over the city.In a separate development on Tuesday, two police officers were arrested after video emerged of them beating an older man on a hospital trolley, heaping further pressure on a force already facing accusations of brutality.The footage, recorded in late June, shows two uniformed officers assaulting the man with batons and holding a cloth over his mouth. There are no other people in the room as the officers abuse the patient over several minutes. Police said the man was under arrest at the time. Hong Kong immigration officials said in an emailed statement that they had contacted the city’s liaison office in Guangdong province as well as the Hong Kong government “to understand the situation” and provide further assistance to the family.Hong Kong has been rocked by mass protests triggered by a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Cheng’s case further underlines fears of a lack of transparency and fairness in the mainland Chinese judicial system and the possibility that Hongkongers may be detained for political reasons.The protests were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist party controls the courts, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.Public anger – fuelled by the aggressive tactics used by the police against demonstrators – has collided with years of frustration over worsening inequality and the cost of living in one of the world\u0027s most expensive, densely populated cities.The protest movement was given fresh impetus on 21 July when gangs of men attacked protesters and commuters at a mass transit station – while authorities seemingly did little to intervene.\u0026nbspUnderlying the movement is a push for full democracy in the city, whose leader is chosen by a committee dominated by a pro-Beijing establishment rather than by direct elections.Protesters have vowed to keep their movement going until their core demands are met, such as the resignation of the city’s leader, Carrie Lam, an independent inquiry into police tactics, an amnesty for those arrested and a permanent withdrawal of the bill.Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong has grown in recent years, as activists have been jailed and pro-democracy lawmakers disqualified from running or holding office. Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a “high degree of autonomy” through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as “one country, two systems”.The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.Lam has shown no sign of backing down beyond agreeing to suspend the extradition bill, while Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city\u0027s semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are “fanning the fire” of unrest in the city. China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to “immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form”.Lily Kuo and Verna Yu in Hong KongUnder administrative detention, under which authorities can detain and interrogate people for a broad number of offences, Cheng can be held for up to 15 days without charge. Human rights advocates say torture and other forms of ill treatment are common under this type of detention.According to Li, Cheng had not participated in the protests or expressed his position on the movement in any public forums. “As far as I know, he did not attend any of the protests, even the 1 million march. I am just worried about him,” she said.Li, who met Cheng while he was studying in Taiwan – where she is from – has been calling and writing to British, Chinese, and Hong Kong officials for help. “He grew up to be a very caring, diligent and hardworking person,” Li said. “Now, he is missing and detained for no reason.

Twitter blocked almost 1,000 accounts associated with the Chinese government on Monday while Facebook also removed seven pages, three groups and five accounts that originated in China.China has repeatedly warned Britain – the former colonial ruler of Hong Kong – against “interference”.

The row erupted after Conte refused to sign an order banning the Open Arms migrant rescue ship from docking in the island of Lampedusa.Salvini, who serves as deputy prime minister and interior minister, was hoping his drastic move on 8 August would immediately collapse the government and bring about snap elections.His strategy could be thwarted if M5S and the PD formed an alternative majority to guide Italy through the delicate budget period in the autumn.Salvini has also signalled the possibility of patching things up with M5S in order to avoid the party’s tie-up with the PD. He said on Tuesday his next move would depend on what Conte said in the senate.“I think Italians have appreciated the way I’ve managed the situation, from Open Arms to the fight against the mafia,” he told Radio 24. “What sense is a government against Salvini, with all inside? A government needs to be strong in order to get things done.

The decision to transmit data is “strictly voluntary”, he added.On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported another two monitoring stations had also suddenly gone offline, bringing the total to four.Lassina Zerbo, the executive secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), wrote earlier this week that the agency was analysing the “potential plume from the explosion” and was “addressing technical problems experienced at two neighbouring stations”. The agency did not immediately confirm the reports about additional offline stations when contacted on Monday.Russia’s atomic agency has said that five of its employees were killed during a test involving a liquid-fuelled rocket and “isotope power sources” at a military testing range.Some analysts have said Russia could have been testing an experimental cruise missile that carries a nuclear reactor on board, although other theories have been suggested. They include a nuclear-powered cooling system for liquid-fuelled rockets or other hypersonic or nuclear-powered missile projects.The Burevestnik (Storm Petrel) experimental cruise missile – called Skyfall by Nato – is an ambitious nuclear-powered cruise missile in development by Russia\u0027s armed forces.The concept builds on an idea originally examined by the US in the late 1950s: a nuclear-powered missile able to fly vast distances powered by an on-board reactor, tracing a complex flight path to outflank enemy defences.Essentially the idea has been to develop a missile with effectively no limitation of conventional fuel range, which could fly around the globe multiple times or trace a flight path – for instance – over the Pacific and through South America to target the US via Mexican airspace, making conventional anti-missile defences, as they are currently deployed, redundant.The US air defence network is configured on the assumption any air attack would come from the north, west, or east, but not the south. By comparison the US Tomahawk cruise missile has a range of 1500 miles.Dismissed by the US decades ago because of the dangers and technical problems involved, the missile has been pursued by Russia in the last few years along with other vehicles designed to outfox conventional defences\u0026nbsp including high-speed underwater drones and hypersonic glide vehicles.According to what little is known about the project, the missile is designed to be launched using a traditional jet propulsion motor before the nuclear power plant takes over in the air.While it would be a formidable weapon if successfully deployed, leapfrogging US missile capabilities, doubts remain among researchers as to whether its core technology is viable. Peter BeaumontThe comprehensive test ban treaty, signed in 1996, prohibits civilian and military experiments involving nuclear explosions. It is not in force because it has not been signed or ratified by a number of countries, including the US, but Russia has set up monitoring stations that transmit data to the organisation headed by Zerbo in Vienna, Austria.This month’s blast is not believed to have been caused by a nuclear reaction, but by the ignition of rocket fuel being used in the experiment.The CTBTO receives information from approximately 300 stations around the world that identify nuclear testing by providing seismic, hydroacoustic and other data. The monitoring stations at Dubna and Kirov, which ceased transmitting data on 10 August, monitor radionuclide particles in the air.On Tuesday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said that president Vladimir Putin, was receiving updates about the situation in Severodvinsk, where gamma radiation exceeded the normal level by 16 times after the explosion on 8 August.But Peskov said of the test stations: “I don’t know what those stations are, and what data they transmit,” he said. “It is outside of our purview.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991056.1566236182!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parking blackspots worst places for clamping in dublin are revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLast year, Dublin City Council  recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe  Almost 130 motorists on average are having their vehicles clamped each day in Dublin city.Figures provided by Dublin City Council show a total of 23,383 vehicles were clamped for illegal parking in the first six months of 2019 – a daily average of 129.The number of clamping fees imposed on motorists is virtually unchanged over the same period last year, but is down 19 per cent on the corresponding figures for 2017.However, the latest figures indicate a reduction in illegal parking rates as the decrease in the number of vehicles clamped last year was partially linked to long periods of bad weather associated with Storm Emma in the first half of 2018.A spokesperson for Dublin City Council said it believed the downward trend was linked to “greater education and compliance”.Mespil Road remains the top blackspot for illegal parking in Dublin city, with 416 vehicles clamped at the location between January and June.The figures show that Ranelagh has emerged as a new location for large numbers of vehicles to be clamped – 320 in the first half of this year compared to just 35 over the same period in 2018.Most of the offending vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway.Local Green Party councillor Hazel Chu welcomed the increased enforcement levels and stressed that there were enough parking spaces in the area to facilitate customers of businesses in Ranelagh.“Parking in the clearway also affects the cycle lane, which makes cycling more dangerous. At the same time, there needs to be clarity with signs to inform motorists when they are allowed to park on the main road through Ranelagh,” Ms Chu said.Valid paid parkingThe most common reason why vehicles were clamped in the first half of 2019 was a failure to have valid paid parking, which accounted for a third of all offences.Almost 4,000 motorists had their vehicle clamped because the time on their parking fee had elapsed, including the 10-minute “grace period”.Almost 2,000 vehicles were clamped for parking on a clearway, while more than 1,400 were detected parking on a footpath and a further 1,000 for parking a non-goods vehicle in a loading bay.A total of 815 vehicles were clamped for parking in a bus lane and another 213 for parking in a disabled parking space without a valid permit. Another 39 vehicles were clamped for parking in spaces reserved for electric vehicles.Despite a high-profile campaign by a number of cycling groups to highlight the extent of illegal parking on cycle lanes, the latest figures show that less than one vehicle is being clamped per day for such an offence.In the first six months of the year, a total of 125 vehicles were clamped for parking on a cycle lane, although the figure is up on 49 for the same period in 2018.The council spokesperson said there had been no change of policy in terms of targeting any particular form of parking infringement.“Dublin City Council continues to enforce illegal parking throughout the city to ensure maximum use of spaces in the city,” she added.Last year, the council recorded revenue of €27.9 million from parking fees and a further €3.2 million in clamp release fees.New contractEarlier this month, the council awarded Dublin Street Parking Services a new contract to continue to provide parking enforcement services for a further five-year period.The standard clamp release fee is €80. Vehicles which are not removed within 24 hours are towed away and impounded, leaving their owners to face a release fee of €160 and a daily storage charge of €35 to have them returned.It is estimated that approximately 0.2 per cent of vehicles which are parked in Dublin city are clamped. Around 13 million parking tickets or payments are recorded each year.The local authority operates more than 1,000 pay-and-display meters around the city for almost 30,000 on-street parking spaces.Since 2017 motorists are entitled to a “grace period” of 10 minutes from the expiry of their parking ticket before their vehicle can be clamped.Parking officials are now also statutorily obliged to remove clamps within two hours of a release fee being paid."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Killing my be linked to gangland drugs feud in the Lurgan-Portadown-Banbridge areaGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information about blaze which broke out near Lifford on SundayMen held in connection with discovery of bomb under car in Shandon Park, Belfast in June\u0026lsquoThey\u0026rsquore creating a fear in people who don\u0026rsquot know what\u0026rsquos happening\u0026rsquoProperty registry body says number of scams targeting students rises at this time of yearPSNI appeals for witnesses after incident described as \u0026lsquotruly appalling\u0026rsquo by councillorIndustry groups seek logistical options as fears of no-deal Brexit and port delays growCabinet documents investigate ideas in relation to future funding of broadcastingPhonecall with Taoiseach reveals Johnson sticking to stance on withdrawal agreementSenior officer says dissident republicans were behind the assault close to the BorderOireachtas committee to consider ownership issues and costbenefit of proposed rolloutBritish PM had proposed alternative guarantees for the Border in lieu of backstopForce asserts checks are not needed as presence of children at certain sites is \u0026lsquoincidental\u0026rsquoSome 129 vehicles are clamped in Dublin every day, with Mespil Road among worst areasAttorney General and Minister for Justice had already raised concerns about the plansPolice and a British army bomb disposal team enticed to the area with a hoax deviceDaft.ie report author says lowering rents, increasing supply must be Government goalsSEAI says it does not have enough funding for all applicants, but Bruton disputes claim"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3991247.1566251772!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"call for state to devise alternative ship routes to europe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFreight trucks at Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford: Industry groups  warn delays at English ports could hit the transport of fresh food and time-sensitive produce. Photograph:  Niall CarsonPAPressure is building on the Government to advance plans for alternative shipping routes bypassing Britain to avoid severe delays at English Channel ports stemming from a possible no-deal Brexit. Potential risks to the key “landbridge” transit route for Irish traders through the UK to Europe have escalated in light of the UK government’s no-deal plans which show severe disruptions at British ports.Operation Yellowhammer, the secret UK planning dossier leaked over the weekend, warns of significant interruptions at UK ports that could last up to three months after Brexit.The report says up to 85 per cent of lorries travelling across the Channel may not be ready for French customs, creating delays of two days and a severe bottleneck for Irish hauliers bound for Europe. About 150,000 haulage units use the landbridge every year, leading to concerns among Irish businesses that there is insufficient capacity on direct shipping routes to Europe to offer an alternative for this traffic.Fresh foodIndustry groups have warned delays at English ports could affect the transport of fresh food and time-sensitive produce, and have criticised the Government for not developing detailed alternative plans.“What are the Government’s contingency plans for this? All I have heard from the Government is there is increased capacity for Dublin to Cherbourg but that is not a viable alternative to the scale and type of goods using the landbridge,” said Aidan Flynn, general manager of Freight Transport Association Ireland. “This is where the Government are letting themselves down. There hasn’t been enough joined-up thinking amongst the various stakeholders around the table. Planning has been ad hoc and focused on customs and tariffs but it is the movement and access to market that are the most important things.Irish Ferries sails from Dublin to Cherbourg three times a week, while Stena Line also sails three times a week from Rosslare to Cherbourg but on different days. This could lead to a potential demand for daily sailings from each port should a no-deal Brexit at the next deadline of October 31st disrupt landbridge traffic. Ferry companiesThe Government has said there is sufficient capacity on existing direct ferry routes to France to meet current market demand. Should that change, commercial operators will respond where necessary. Hauliers warn of a potential shortage of capacity on the longer sea routes to the European ports of Zeebrugge and Rotterdam that would be required to put traders closer to their markets.Several sources conceded that the direct routes to Europe, last between 20 and 40 hours, would be too long for Irish importers and exporters transporting fresh food and time-sensitive produce. The ferry companies servicing the Irish ports are said to be looking at alternative arrangements in the event of English ports being severely affected by congestion in the event of a no-deal Brexit scenario. “Irish Ferries will respond to the market demands whatever they are at whatever stage,” said the ferry company’s parent, Irish Continental Group, in response to queries.European shipping companies could add vessels and routes on direct services between Ireland and Europe, depending on the level of demand and disruption to cross-channel transit from a crash-out Brexit. Importers and exporters were urged to look at using alternative ports on the English east coast to avoid Dover, the busiest UK port on the channel, to avoid the inevitable no-deal Brexit delays. “Businesses will have to actively export using other east-coast ports,” said Neil McDonnell, chief executive of Isme, the representative body for the country’s small and mid-sized businesses.“Operation Yellowhammer has shown that they could be facing three months of torture.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe .The response to the letter from Boris Johnson to Donald Tusk was the same in Brussels on Tuesday morning as it was in Dublin last night — a semi-polite rebuff to the idea that the backstop can be jettisoned from the withdrawal agreement and replaced by vague commitments from London that there would be no new Border in Ireland.Dublin and Brussels both view the proposals as unrealistic and directed more at Johnson’s domestic audience — and the desire to avoid blame for any no-deal outcome — than a serious attempt to engage with the EU.As such, it confirms their view that they should wait and see what the outcome is of the inevitable parliamentary showdown between Johnson’s government and the opponents of no-deal in September.The stout British defence of the Belfast Agreement in Johnson’s letter is taken as a sign that London has woken up to the importance of the views of US politicians who have vowed to block a post-Brexit trade deal if the UK causes the re-imposition of border checks.If Johnson really wants to engage with the EU, then he will come up with detailed proposals for the mechanisms and guarantees his letter acknowledges will be needed to avoid a border.As Dublin and Brussels have both pointed out since Monday’s letter from the prime minister, there is no sign of that yet. It might come, the EU reckons, and it might not. Johnson might call an election and lose, or he might win. Or he could delay it to allow a no-deal to happen in October.Any one of several outcomes is possible in Westminster. But a reasonable proposal that the EU could consider certainly hasn’t come yet. So they will wait and see.ShiftedWhat is apparent from Johnson’s words, though, is that the British government’s approach to the border issue has shifted profoundly. Theresa May accepted that the way to avoid a hard border was to remove the need for checks Johnson believes — or says he believes — the way to avoid a hard border is to manage the checks in a way that does not obstruct trade or free movement.The rather large hole in his argument — as the EU keeps pointing out — is that he has not shown how that can be done. Johnson’s push and the Irish and EU pushback of the last 24 hours starkly illustrates that unless something changes, then we are on course for a no-deal in October.As August moves into September and the unpredictable drama at Westminster resumes, that is likely to mean increased pressure on the Irish Government to say how it will manage a no-deal in practice. Extensive planning has been done, as the Government’s Brexit publications attest. But there is as yet no real detail about how the border will be managed in the event of no-deal. That is likely to be the focus for considerable attention, public and private, in the weeks ahead.Both Dublin and Brussels say that no-deal planning is a “unilateral” exercise — they will not talk to the UK about how to manage a no-deal outcome. But Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has also said that one way to avoid border checks would be to have checks on food and animals arriving from Britain at Northern Ireland’s ports. That would obviously require British agreement, which will not be forthcoming without talks, and may not be forthcoming at all.As another summer ends, it seems to have been going on forever. But the Brexit saga will reach a few decisive points in the coming weeks and Ireland is at the epicentre of it.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Daniel Lead OlivasAFPGetty Images. People opposing the Brexit backstop without coming up with a realistic alternative support the return of an Irish Border, European Council president Donald Tusk has said. In a Twitter post which followed UK prime minister Boris Johnson calling for the removal of the backstop from the withdrawal deal reached between British and EU negotiators, Mr Tusk said: “The backstop is an insurance to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland unless and until an alternative is found. “Those against the backstop and not proposing realistic alternatives in fact support re-establishing a border. Even if they do not admit it.”Mr Johnson on Monday told Ireland and the EU that alternative guarantees to avoid Border checks could be inserted into the withdrawal agreement but the backstop must be removed before the current October 31st Brexit deadline.However, Dublin was cool on the proposals last night. While the Government issued no formal response, two senior sources played down the significance of the British initiatives and said that the position had not changed, that the Brexit withdrawal agreement could not be renegotiated.Officials said Tánaiste Simon Coveney spoke to the British Brexit secretary Steve Barclay on Tuesday in a call that lasted 30 minutes. ‘Disappointment’According to a statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Coveney “reiterated Ireland’s desire to have an orderly Brexit and conveyed disappointment at the UK government’s letter to the European Council”.Mr Coveney also stressed the “the importance of the commitments made by the UK in December 2017” when the British government pledged to avoid a hard border in Ireland by maintaining alignment with EU standards for goods. In his letter to Mr Tusk, Mr Johnson specifically retreated from that commitment.Senior sources in Dublin pointed to the lack of any detail in Mr Johnson’s letter about how a hard border could be avoided, or what the nature of any alternative guarantees could be.Mr Johnson reiterated British opposition to the backstop, the legal guarantee that the North will continue to follow EU rules and standards if no new trade deal is agreed in order to avoid a hard border.Mr Coveney also told Mr Barclay that “while Ireland was always open for dialogue, the negotiation was between the UK and EU”. He also said he was concerned about “the lack of alternatives to the backstop in the letter from the UK government and repeated the need for legal certainty on the border issue,” the statement said.The British Department for Exiting the EU did not have any initial reaction to the call. Mr Coveney will travel to Belfast on Tuesday evening to meet the new Northern secretary Julian Smith.North-South relationsA spokesman for the DUP, which props up the minority Conservative government at Westminster, said the party recognised that some people were concerned about the impact of Brexit on North-South relations and trade and believe the backstop is the way to deal with these issues.“However there can be no disguising the fact the backstop would place barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom,” he said. “We have been strongly highlighting the fact that Unionism in Northern Ireland does not support the backstop. None of the main unionist parties and groupings support the backstop. If Europe and the Republic of Ireland are serious about ensuring and recognising that progress in Northern Ireland is founded on support from both major traditions then it will have to face the reality that the backstop is not the way forward.”James Cleverly, chairman of the Conservative Party, on Tuesday said the EU needs to show flexibility over the backstop because the issue of whether Britain leaves the bloc with or without a deal is now mainly up to Brussels. He said the EU’s insistence on the backstop was the main sticking point in reaching a deal.Mr Cleverly told the BBC that “negotiations only work if people are willing to move and be adaptable” and that what Mr Johnson is asking the EU to do “is look at reality”.‘Sticking point’“The withdrawal agreement, because of the backstop, has been rejected by the House of Commons three times and it’s been very very clear that that is the sticking point, but without that there is a good chance of getting a deal through the House and that’s what the prime minister has said he wants to do.”He added: “We’re making it very very clear we want a deal, but if that is not possible, if the EU are unable or unwilling to make a concession like this then we are going to leave on 31st October that has got to be what happens, that’s what we’ve committed to, that’s what we are going to do.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Simon DawsonEPABoris Johnson’s government is to launch a major public information campaign to reassure Britons about a potential no-deal Brexit, as the prime minister said he was “confident” the EU would change its position on the Irish border backstop.Downing Street declined to comment on the leaked document about Operation Yellowhammer, its planning for a no-deal Brexit. But officials said the document was “out of date” and did not reflect the government’s state of preparedness. Whitehall insiders said the media campaign, with a budget of £100 million, would begin in the next couple of weeks to explain in a “user-friendly way” what iniduals needed to do ahead of Brexit day on October 31st. In an effort to rebut the stark warnings in a leaked contingency planning paper, the emphasis will be on consumers.Those with knowledge of the preparations said the campaign would be run on TV, radio and social media. The government is working to ensure that its official website is ready for a significant increase in traffic once the campaign launches. It will include details of what consumers need to do to be prepared for travel abroad.A Number 10 spokesperson said “further information will be published in the coming weeks” on government preparations for leaving the EU with or without a deal, noting that Mr Johnson had “significantly stepped up planning” for no-deal. Downing Street insisted it had been “engaging widely” with businesses, despite lobby groups expressing concern that smaller firms were underprepared.Mr Johnson insists he still wants to strike a deal with Brussels. But during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall, he said it was “very much up to our friends” to change their stance on the withdrawal agreement, admitting that other European nations were “showing a little bit of reluctance”.“They have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the withdrawal agreement, the backstop just doesn’t work, it’s not democratic and I hope that they will see fit to compromise but in the meantime we get ready to come out on October 31st,” he told Sky News.“That’s fine, I’m confident that they will. But in the meantime we have to get ready for a no-deal outcome. I want a deal. We’re ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”Widespread disruptionResponding to the leaked Yellowhammer document, Mr Johnson added that he was “very confident” that the government would be ready for departure on October 31st, with or without a deal. “I’m not pretending that there won’t be bumps on the road. There will be, I said that on the steps of Downing Street, but if everybody puts their minds to it I have absolutely no doubt that we can get ready.”The Yellowhammer document said the consequences of a no-deal exit could be widespread disruption - possibly for months - to trade, food and medicine distribution, fishing, and fuel supplies, and civil unrest.Parliament will have a chance to scrutinise no-deal planning in early September. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of no-deal preparations, will update MPs on the government’s preparatory work for Brexit when it returns on September 3rd, according to officials.This will be the first of what will become weekly updates to the House of Commons on preparations for leaving the EU and Mr Gove is expected to cover the activities of the daily and weekly committees working on deal preparations.Downing Street has rejected a call from 110 MPs to recall parliament early from its summer recess to allow further scrutiny of its Brexit plans.“The House of Commons agreed the date it would rise for summer recess, as well as its return on September 3rd and this was passed by a majority of close to 200 MPs,” a spokesperson said.Only the government has the power to recall parliament early.No-confidence motionIn a keynote speech in Corby, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a vote of no confidence in the Johnson government when parliament returns next month.However, Mr Corbyn did not spell out whether this would be tabled immediately after parliament returns on September 3rd or at some later date.“I will bring a vote of no confidence in the government, and if we’re successful, I would seek to form a time-limited caretaker administration to avert no deal, and call an immediate general election so the people can decide our country’s future,” he said.Mr Corbyn ruled out suggestions by some MPs that a caretaker government could only be formed by a figure commanding wider support across the Commons.Mr Corbyn said the “constitutional precedent” was for the leader of the opposition to “take over” if a government falls from power.

We haven\u0027t moved with the times and we have to move with the times to combat the threat we are facing daily from those who simply have no respect for law and order.Mr Adderley has previously called for Tasers to be standard issue within three years, but said he was not prepared to wait and that Northamptonshire Police and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold was fully supportive. The force has just over 1,000 frontline officers.It will take 18 months to train and equip the officers and cost around £220,000. In a tweet, Mr Adderley said risks to officers had changed dramatically, adding: Our officers have a right to feel safe, supported and adequately equipped to tackle this sickening trend.The announcement follows the death of Pc Andrew Harper in Berkshire last week as he responded to reports of a burglary, the latest incident where an officer has been harmed while on duty.Earlier this month, Pc Stuart Outten was attacked with a machete in Leyton, east London, and used a Taser despite being stabbed in the head, while West Midlands Police Pc Gareth Phillips was run over with his patrol car in Birmingham.Issuing Tasers is a matter for each inidual police force, but Police Federation of England and Wales national chairman John Apter said: We should ensure every officer who wants to carry a Taser can do so. Officer safety should never come second to balancing the books.Kent is spending almost £1 million to increase its Taser-trained officer force from 330 to 1,500. Any of its frontline officers likely to face violence will be able to be trained in their use.The politan Police is increasing its Taser-trained officers by 75 per cent to 6,830 by next March, West Midlands is going from 600 to 1,440 and Greater Manchester is doubling its force to 1,100 of its 6,300 front-line officers.Police are also deploying a more powerful version of the Taser, the X2, which can disable two suspects at once with two 50,000 volt shots without having to be reloaded. It also has greater velocity to penetrate thick clothing. A third generation Taser is about to be evaluated by police.The review of the police’s frontline workforce by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) for the Home Office found that “more, or all, officers should be issued with Tasers, especially when single crewing.” Other methods of restraint such as incapacitant spray were felt to be less effective while police chiefs argued that it could defuse violent situations, often without being fired.Law and orderBoris Johnson attempting to pin blame on Brussels for hard border with his Brexit letterBrexit latest news: Donald Tusk accuses Boris Johnson of trying to impose hard border in Northern IrelandGreat British Bake Off goes millennial for 2019 with youngest ever line-upAs Boris Johnson sits down to talk Brexit with Angela Merkel, five things we can expect from their meetingWoman in video of Prince Andrew at Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s house \u0026#39is daughter of ex-Australian prime minister\u0026#39 Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces \u0026#39suffocating\u0026#39 new restrictions in Iranian prisonBordeaux winemakers forced to promote rose and white wines as young drinkers abandon red  Audio Briefings: Sign up to our WhatsApp group for essential twice-daily updatesDesperate migrants on rescue vessel jump overboard in bid to reach Italian island of LampedusaWealthy teens twice as likely to drink as those from less affluent familiesBritain \u0026#39extremely concerned\u0026#39 as Hong Kong consulate official detained in mainland ChinaComment: The EU has shown it is willing to gamble everything to preserve its theological attachment to the Single Market\tComment: Boris Johnson is leaving Brussels in no doubt about what he wants as a Brexit dealComment: All the Great British Bake Off series ranked, from worst to bestParents should resist urge to brag about their children’s exam results online, Good Schools Guide saysBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsComment: Here are five ways to make the civil service ready to deliver Brexit by October 31Comment: Why do we take seriously the pig-ignorant radicals who masquerade as animal lovers?Man accused of murdering Pc Andrew Harper appears in courtWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/01/13/mercedes-production-line.jpg","title":"germany recession economy euro zone bundesbank","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsFall in exports that drove German\u0026nbspeconomy into contraction in second quarter is still hitting its manufacturing sector\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentEurope’s largest economy Germany could be in the middle of a recession, its central bank has said, pointing to persistent weakness in industry.German GDP dropped 0.1 per cent in the second quarter as demand for its exports was sapped by a global slowdown, as well as by stockpiling ahead of the original Brexit deadline in March.\u0026nbspGerman output will remain “lacklustre” in the third quarter and “could continue to fall slightly”, the Bundesbank said on Monday. Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically defined as a recession.The contraction between April and June was mostly driven by sinking demand from abroad, the Bundesbank said. Exports “were down substantially”, it noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March prompted companies to build up stocks in the first quarter.“As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected,” the Bundesbank said.Appetite for German cars and other goods has also waned in China as growth in the world’s second-largest economy is cooling, partly due to the year-long trade war with the US.Up until a week ago, economists surveyed by Bloomberg were predicting\u0026nbspthat Germany’s economy will grow by 0.2 per cent in the current quarter.But since then big-name institutions including Deutsche Bank have lowered their expectations. The concern for many analysts is that continuing global trade tensions will prolong the downturn in German manufacturing and eventually feed through to the still-strong services sector.The central bank’s forecast follows weeks of disappointing economic data and news of meagre earnings at German companies. The government has signalled that it might be willing to step up spending should the downturn worsen.The European Central Bank is also considering providing extra monetary stimulus to the wider euro zone.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Fans are hoping Styles will also address rumours that he is set to take part in a major new film, after reportedly turning down the role of Prince Eric in Disney\u0027s live-action remake of The Little Mermaid.\u0026nbspHe is apparently seeking a new project after receiving acclaim for his role in Christopher Nolan\u0027s box office hit\u0026nbspDunkirk\u0026nbspin 2017.\u0026nbspEarlier this year, the former One Direction star and now-solo artist auditioned for the role of Elvis Presley in Baz Luhrmann\u0027s biopic of the rock and roll singer, but lost the part to US actor Austin Butler.\u0026nbspThe interview will likely also feature discussion of\u0026nbsppotential new music, following the release of Styles\u0027s self-titled, critically praised debut album in 2017.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspnext issue of\u0026nbspRolling Stone\u0026nbspis out on 3 September.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So are\u0026nbspattempts by the Saudis to reheat isions between Sunnis and Shia. Are we right to view the region as a place of sectarian strife, asks Robert Fisk. Or is religious coexistence in the Arab world much stronger than antagonism and violence?Click to followThe IndependentThere are two stories that I and my colleagues have been writing about the Middle East for more than 40 years. Both are wrong.\u0026nbspThe first is that the next war will be about water. Or the lack of it. I started writing about the conflict over H2O when I visited Aleppo and found that the Queiq river – which was supposed to run beneath the fine white stone bridges in the city centre – only reached the outskirts as a two-foot wide stream of sewage.Turkey decided to build dams on the Tigris – and the waters of that great river started to fall in Iraq. The Lebanese claimed that the Israelis were stealing water from the Litani river in southern Lebanon. There were secret pipelines in deep valleys invisible from the air, they said. I trudged with UN soldiers through the actual river, downstream, in these dark ravines. But there were no pipes.And there’s been no war. The second, far more sinister, story we’ve all covered is that the Middle East is a sectarian quagmire in which religion and faith have created an age-old antagonism between Muslims and Christians, between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and between Muslims, Christians and Jews. The region is therefore permanently at war, its people poisoned by sectarian hatreds and doomed to eternal conflict – which we civilised westerners must occasionally step in to sort out.\u0026nbspDidn’t the French and British arrive in Lebanon in 1860 to stop the Druze slaughtering the Christian Maronites? Didn’t the British have to intervene to stop fighting between Muslim and Christian Palestinians and Jewish immigrants in Palestine between 1920 and our humiliating retreat in 1948? Didn’t the Americans and British and French and Italians arrive in Lebanon to end a Christian-Muslim civil war in 1982? Didn’t the Americans have to send their troops to separate Sunni and Shia death squads in 2004 and 2005 and 2006?In our reports – certainly in mine – much emphasis was placed on the suffering of Catholic Maronites in Lebanon, Copts in Egypt and Catholics and other Christian sects in Iraq. They were being slowly driven from the Holy Land, we would write. I recall visiting a clutch of burnt-out Egyptian churches and bombed churches in Iraq. The headlines – for obvious reasons – always used the word “exodus”. And the flight of the Christians – to Europe, America, Australia – was always “of Biblical proportions”.Mahmoud Abbas and Pope Francis in front of the Church of Nativity\u0026nbspin Bethlehem\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)In the northern Syrian city of Qamishleh, I sat beside a church with a group of Orthodox and Catholic bishops and clergymen in a variety of black hats and red sashes. The Syrian war had been underway for four years. Please, they begged, stop telling Christians to leave the Middle East. We had been attending a Syriac wedding where clerics were bedecked in gold, scarlet and black robes. There were hosts of blazing candles, a multitude of blessings, and much ululating a very definite reminder that Christianity was an Eastern – not a western – religion. But of Qamishleh’s 8,000 Christian souls, only 5,000 remained. Isis\u0026nbsphad seen to that. Most of the Christians were Assyrians, the descendants of the 1915 Assyrian genocide, which accompanied the far larger holocaust of a million and a half Armenian Christians at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.The clerics in Qamishleh – part of it still held by the Syrian regime, the rest by the Kurds – believed that their latest “exodus”\u0026nbsp(there I go again) only began after the 2003 Anglo-American invasion of Iraq whose architects, as we all know, were born-again Christians. One of the priests spoke loudly and with considerable anger. “This loss of Christians is a very negative thing,” he said.Among the priests was a certain Father Gabriel, tired and sick since he fled his Syriac church in Deir ez-Zour in July 2012. “Nusra totally destroyed our church there and all our houses,” he said. “We thought we would be able to return in about 15\u0026nbspdays”. Which is, I noted at the time, what the Palestinians – Christians as well as Muslims – thought when they fled their homes in 1948. “The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries. In a couple of generations, the Syriacs in the European countries will have disappeared.”The west is not receiving us because theirs are Christian countries. They are secular countries. In a couple of generations, the\u0026nbspSyriacs\u0026nbspin the European countries will have disappearedFather Saliba recalled how Isis\u0026nbsphad captured the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, burnt\u0026nbspits churches and libraries and established its “Islamic State”. “France said: ‘We will take the Christians in’, but we believe we should live here…. Now Isis\u0026nbsptries to destroy us so we will have no place in this country. We knew early on that this was an existential challenge to our presence in the Middle East.”\u0026nbspBut, I thought at the time, hasn’t the presence of Christians in the Arab world always be an “existential challenge”? I recalled how in Lebanon, I had once been taken on a scholarly tour of the tiny Maronite Christian parishes high above the Mediterranean, squat humps of churches in the hills north of Beirut, the sun white on their stones, sometimes built over Roman temples, much as Muslims would later construct their mosques within or around Christian churches. In many cases, the eyes of the saints and holy men of Christianity on the ancient church frescoes had been gouged out and local Maronite villagers told us that this was the work of the Muslim invaders of the eighth century.\u0026nbspBehnam and Mart Sarah Syriac Catholic Church, which was damaged and defaced during its occupation by Isis (AFPGetty)Untrue, said the experts. Many monasteries converted to Islam and the monks themselves cut the eyes from their own Biblical heroes in order to conform to the Muslim world’s refusal to countenance the portrayal of a human face in a place of worship. French academic Christian Decobert believed that when the Arabs arrived in Egypt, the Near East and in North Africa, all the countries were Christian. “Half of the Persians were Christian ... Under the Byzantines, there was a man of religion who had power and very frequently he was in charge of the collection of taxes,” Decobert said.When the Arabs began to settle in their newly conquered lands, they decided to create an administration. And of course – this is my own interpretation – they needed tax collectors. “Some monasteries disappeared,” Decobert said. “Some survived. Some converted to Islam – this was nothing to do with faith, it was about the cultural system. And the first people who converted to Islam were the monks. So the heads of the monasteries became key people in the Islamic system. There was no distinction between religious and economic life.”Kamal Salibi, one of the finest of Lebanon’s modern historians – a Protestant and an old friend, he died almost eight years ago – wrote a short but revealing book called A House of Many Mansions, which will still be read a 100 years from now for its historical revelation and its wisdom. He insisted that the Maronites did not come to Lebanon as a persecuted people from the Orontes valley, as they claimed, and that they had in fact begun their life as heretics. As the years passed, Salibi, a professor at the American University of Beirut, became even more sensitive to what he called the “Muslim predicament”\u0026nbspin the Middle East.And it is indeed strange that although they remain a profound minority in the region, the Christians of the Arab world should have become not just a sounding board for Islam, but a minority fine tuner on the instrument of coexistence between two great religions, more often than not in harmony but with a distressing habit of producing discord – to the delight of religious extremists and, alas, of politicians and journalists.Writing my new book on the Middle East, scheduled to be published next year, I intended to devote my chapter on religion to Muslims and Islam. But it was instructive for me to discover, as I worked on the chapter, that it was turning out to be, primarily, about Christians. Perhaps I can give readers a hint as to why this is the case by quoting directly from my text. Needless to say, blood and pain and betrayal crowd the many pages before and after the chapter on religion.Aphrem II, at the heavily damaged church of St\u0026nbspMary in Syria’s eastern city of Deir Ezzor\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)Yet in modern times, Salibi asked, “what traditional civilisation could continue to stand on its feet once the west Europeans – partly as a result of their special genius, partly as a result of their geographical location, partly as a result of their guts and their luck – found a way of going around Africa, crossing the Atlantic and reaching the Americas, tapping wealth beyond the dreams of avarice all over the world ... reducing the whole world to relative poverty and to increasing poverty. Well, from that moment on, the Muslim world and other legitimate civilisations ... could no longer stand in the face of the west. And this is the situation which continues to the present day.”Over Salibi’s lecture to me, needless to say, there hung the canopy of a very dark history the 1860 mutual slaughter of Christians and Druze in Lebanon which the Ottomans were powerless – or unwilling – to control. Muslims descended on the Christians of Damascus in an even worse blood-letting – the “largest single massacre of Christians in the Arab world”, as one historian was to call it – which was suppressed with extreme brutality by the Ottoman Turks. We shall return to this later.\u0026nbspYou have the last Sultans, all of them being pianists and playing Mozart and trying to paint and reading western booksThis did not involve any intention of “converting”\u0026nbsp– in itself a word which has become a cliché and thus obsolescent – but out of what humanist scholar Tarif Khalidi would refer to as “a particular Muslim fascination with Jesus…” Khalidi – still gloriously alive – once spoke to me “of another age and another narrative when Christianity and Islam were more open to each other”, a period when the traditional images of Jesus in Islamic art were like “a love affair between Islam and Jesus”.Once described as “the foremost Islamic scholar of our time” by Edward Said, Khalidi – a Palestinian Muslim whose mother was a prominent Lebanese feminist – is the latest translator (into English) of the Quran. But he is also the author of a wonderful book of Muslim stories about Jesus, a body of literature which he calls the “Muslim gospel”. In Islam, of course, Jesus is greatly revered as a prophet, although his inity is rejected.Created with Sketch.Scars on Middle East landscape bear witness to past peace failures Show all 16Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Syrian tank lies turned over in the Hermon Stream in the Banias Nature Reserve on the western edge of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

If the seventh century martyrdom of Hussein and Ali are a passion play of betrayal and blood whose pain may be framed at Kerbala and Kufa as well as the betrayed and bloodied man on the hill at Golgotha, then perhaps this calvary unites Christians and Shia\u0026nbsprather than Christians and Sunnis. Our attempt to understand the isions within Islam fascinated our Christian ancestors. The 17th century cleric George Abbot, later Archbishop of Canterbury, compared the differences between Sunni and Shia to those between “Papistes and Protestant”.Western ignorance was heightened by just the kind of Catholic-Protestant parallel which Archbishop Abbot drew. For the difference between the two sects is theological, not doctrinal. Sunnis stress the unity of the community, Shia\u0026nbspthe integrity of government. This is echoed in the Iranian-Saudi polemic today: “you are splitting the community’’ versus “you are an unjust government’’. Thus when Churchill created the Iraqi state with a Sunni king from Arabia but with a largely Shiite population, a real ‘line in the sand’ had been drawn long before George Bush senior used that phrase as he sent American troops into Iraq for the first time in 1990.Hamas and Israel in 2014 (AFPGetty)At a time when the world – or at least its media and pseudo-opinion makers – would have us believe that the Middle East is now breaking apart as a result of\u0026nbspinter-religious hatred and warfare, it will be all the more necessary to read the work of Ussama Makdisi – a brilliant professor of history at Rice University in the US and, interestingly, Edward Said’s nephew – when his extraordinary and deeply penetrating study of ecumenism and the modern Arab world is published this autumn.\u0026nbspLike all great histories, the very first words of his text give us his theme. “Every history of sectarianism,” he writes, “is also a history of coexistence.” Makdisi happily concentrates on the northern and eastern part of the Middle East (the ‘mashriq’ in Arabic) – Lebanon, Syria, the occupied Palestinian territories, Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Iraq – rather than all the territory of the former Ottoman empire. This avoids any analysis of the most egregious Middle Eastern but non-Arab sectarian massacre of modern times: the genocide of a million and a half Christian Armenians by Muslim Turks (and Muslim Kurds) in 1915 and the succeeding years, along with the aforesaid Syriac Christians.But the story of Arab coexistence, in the last years of the Ottoman empire and the century after its collapse, provides Makdisi with an opportunity to examine the Middle East’s common share in a global 19th-century revolution. This “revolution”, in Makdisi’s words – and it’s good to use the word in the non-violent sense – “introduced the profoundly important and historic principle of political equality among citizens, many of whom had been discriminated against or classified as inferior in centuries past.” These included Jews in Europe, blacks in the United States, and non-Muslims in the Ottoman Empire. In Ottoman domains, Makdisi suggests, this development occurred after 1860 when the Christians and Druze mercilessly assaulted each other in Lebanon and Syria.Shia\u0026nbspand Sunni Muslim clerics stand on the rubble of Hezbollah’s al-Manar TV station in Beirut.\u0026nbspHumanist education helped Lebanon recover\u0026nbspfrom its 15-year\u0026nbspwar (AFPGetty)He likes to talk about the “ecumenical frame”, the scaffolding upon which the reconciliation of modern political “solidarities” (political equality, etc) were reconciled, with the reality of religious and ethnic differences in the region – which included a new political order which embraced both the “secularity”\u0026nbspof citizens and (italics: and) the necessity of religiously segregated laws which governed (and still govern) marriage, orce and inheritance.\u0026nbspWhen I read the page proofs of Makdisi’s admirably short book, I was immediately reminded of the comic moment when the late President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon suggested that he would like to introduce civil marriage to his country of freedom and coexistence. Far from applauding this magnificent attempt to bring Lebanon into the modern world, normally argumentative bishops and priests and vicars and otherwise suspicious Sunni and Shia\u0026nbspimams and clerics immediately met in mutual conclaves hitherto unknown in the modern history of the Levant – to jointly denounce Hrawi’s isive, unpatriotic and irreligious suggestion.\u0026nbspIt not only encouraged what we might refer to as inter-faith marriage. Far more disastrously, it meant that the huge income obtained from church and mosque control of orce and problems of inheritance would disappear, and might – horror of horrors – be retained by Christian and Muslim families. My own non-academic journalist’s conviction is that “religious”\u0026nbspwars are not in fact created by ergent forms of faith but by property and money. Who holds the most land and the larger amount of treasure applies, I fear, rather too precisely to almost any “theological”\u0026nbspdispute – whether this takes place in lands of oil, overseas investments or the control of real estate (as in ‘a Protestant parliament for a Protestant people’).Makdisi notes with grim cynicism how the massacre of Christians in 1860 in Mount Lebanon and Damascus is dismissed in Arabic literature, even today, as the “haditha”, the “event”\u0026nbsp– the same word used by most Lebanese for their 1975-90 civil war. More perversely, as Makdidi says, this blood-letting is called “tawshat al-nasara” – the “hubbub of the Christians”. The tragedy of Makdisi’s narrative comes, inevitably, with the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin Palestine when – these are my words, not Makdidi’s – a sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular life.AFPGetty)“The loss of a multireligious Palestine was a terrible blow that was compounded by the end of Jewish life in most of the Arab world,” Makdisi writes. “The destruction of the idea that one could be simultaneously Arab and Jewish still scars the Arab world.” And – again, these are my words – if Israel’s supporters object to my own reference above to that nation’s “sectarian state” (since it contains hundreds of thousands of Arab Muslims and Christians), Netanyahu’s support of the new law which makes Israel “the nation state of the Jewish people” should silence them all.Talking of words, I have to say that Makdisi’s otherwise flawless thesis is occasionally crippled by his inability to shake off the fraudulent academic jargon which American universities now seem to inject into their scholars. Much of the text of Age of Coexistence\u0026nbspis mercifully free of this language. But I sighed repeatedly when I had to negotiate “historicisin” “empathetic” (for sympathetic), “valorised”, “secularity”, “consociational”, ”coevalness”, “situate” (for place), and our old enemies “posit”\u0026nbspand “space”. These words are the secret scripture of the clique, the little academic verbal and semantic ticks and contrivances designed to keep the elite of academia safe from proles like us. But Makdisi’s work is too important for these irritations to distract us. What he does is to remind us, repeatedly, of the critical declarations of secularism which existed in the history of the Middle East.The tragedy of\u0026nbspMakdisi’s\u0026nbspnarrative comes\u0026nbspwith the Balfour Declaration in favour of a Jewish “homeland” in Palestine when\u0026nbspa sectarian state for Jews was introduced to the Middle East at the moment when Arabs were (hopefully) adhering to a new model of non-sectarian secular lifeWhen the Sharif Hussain was negotiating with Colonel Henry McMahon over the future of the Ottoman Middle East – the all critical correspondence containing Britain’s most outrageous betrayal of the Arabs – he (Hussain) wrote of how “the Muslim is indistinguishable from the Christian, for they are both descendants of one forefather”, while McMahon challenged Hussain’s claim to Syria and what is now Lebanon on the grounds that they were not “purely Arab”. The Christians of the region, in other words, could not be “Arab”\u0026nbspin the eyes of the British.\u0026nbspHussain’s non-sectarian nationalism was all the more instrumental since it almost coincided with the 1919 constitution of Syria when Hussain’s son Faisal briefly ran his “Arab kingdom”, which guaranteed freedom of religious thought and religious practices for “all sects” and promised that each community (Christian, Muslim, Jewish) could administer its own personal status laws and local councils. In the same year, as Makdisi reminds us, the Egyptian Christian Coptic priest Qommus Sergius preached national unity from inside the great Al-Azhar in Cairo, the most venerable Muslim religious institution in Egypt, perhaps in the Arab world.Al-Nuri Mosque in the Old City of Mosul (AFPGetty)This “new”\u0026nbspkind of secular nationalism was bursting forth within the Arab world at the same time as Anatolia was being emptied of its Christian Armenians by the Muslim Turks. Christian Arabs were largely unaffected and untouched by this act of genocide. Turkish reforms, originally secular in character and at first welcomed by the Armenian themselves, turned into sectarian nationalism and, I suspect, were already taking on the aspect of fascism when Ataturk created the Turkish state. Ataturk’s passing was mourned by the Nazi paper Volkisher Beobachter with a black-fringed front page. This heritage, alas, continues in Turkey even today.Few Arabs in the Middle East today dispute the sectarianism which the French, British and later American empires re-injected into the Middle East. The French ripped Lebanon from Syria and set up minorities – especially the Alawites – to control Sunni Muslims in Syria. The British were intent on creating a Jewish “homeland”\u0026nbspin a part of the Ottoman empire which had hitherto been a homeland for Jews, Muslims and Christians. Oddly, Lebanon survived with more freedom than most of its Arab neighbours. The primary task of government, Makdisi points out, was “to harmonise relations between communities, not democratise relations between inidual secular citizens.” To Arab thinkers in Beirut and Damascus, including many Christians, ‘Arabism’ should be defined “not by ethnicity, blood or race ... but by a common culture”.Oman will find itself in troubled waters if it keeps playing two sidesWhat is Britain’s policy on Iran?Lies and buffoonery: Boris Johnson’s fantasy darkens the Middle EastHow Egypt’s army determines the destiny of the entire Middle EastCertainly, Makdisi does not avoid the creation of the Arab dictatorships. “The tragedy of the military nationalists in Iraq, Syria, and Egypt,” he writes, “was that their commitment to revolution was far more energetically manifested in their construction of post-colonial security regimes than it was in building postcolonial democratic secular states.”In other words, while the military men destroyed modern Arab politics, Islamists threatened to destroy modern Arab culture. Mosques and churches could stand in this sparse environment. Political parties and trade unions were smashed. One of the great late 19th century Lebanese intellectuals, Boutros Boustani, a Christian translator of the Bible into Arabic, founded a school for Maronite Christian, Sunni and Shia Muslim children to educate pupils in a non-religious environment. In his self-financed newspaper, he preached that knowledge led to enlightenment which led, in turn, to “the death of fanaticism and the birth of ideals held in common…the fundamental cause of the trouble was the intolerance that is born of ignorance, and that the only way to peace among the sects lay across the untilled field of knowledge.”Or, as we would say today with Blairite repetition: education, education, education. Perhaps that is why Lebanon, the most educated population in the Arab world, recovered from its 15-year civil war in the late 20th century. Humanist education remains the watchword of Tarif Khalidi. It’s a lonely battle in a landscape of generals and autocrats who will use history but never acknowledge its lessons. That is why the Sharif Hussains and the King Faisals and the Salibis and the Boustanis and the Makdisis are so valuable.\u0026nbspThen I am reminded of a walk along a Manhattan pavement during the Iraqi civil war atrocities after the Anglo-American invasion. There on a news-stand was the latest copy of Time magazine, a journal I usually stay away from. But its front cover promised “how to tell the difference” between a Sunni and a Shia. Different ways of praying, different kinds of mosques. I bought it, of course. Heaven spare us all.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Figures from the Gambling Commission estimate that 55,000 children in the UK could have a gambling problem.Fruit machines remain the most common way for children to first encounter gambling but bookmakers and online casinos have come under increasing pressure over the proliferation of adverts for betting, particularly in places where children are likely to see it such as during football matches and on social media.The available evidence indicates that exposure to gambling at a young age increases the risk that a person will become addicted in later life.Twitter has become an important platform for both traditional and e-sports companies to advertise to potential customers. The study found that the five biggest operators –\u0026nbspLadbrokes, bet365, Coral, Betfred​ and Paddy Power – sent an average of 78 tweets per day.Much of this content is “designed to be widely attractive, memetic and, most importantly, shareable,” the study’s authors wrote. “As a result, it is very difficult to restrict, or even predict, the audience for a given piece of messaging.”Despite the risks of children being exposed, just 0.1 per cent of social media gambling ads were found to contain a warning about the minimum age for placing a bet.The advertising\u0026nbspindustry’s code of conduct states that\u0026nbsp“marketing communications must be obviously identifiable as such” but many of the social media adverts assessed did not do this.Close to three-quarters of the gambling adverts appeared to break advertising industry regulation in some way, the researchers said.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday June 29, 2019Dr Becker told The Independent: “That is, of course not an extremely big difference, but it comes from a data set with thousands of respondents. Hence, while children might not be the biggest driver of life satisfaction and happiness it has on average still a\u0026nbspsignificant influence.”They found that adults who have regular contact with their children are happier than parents who still live with their children or never had them.\u0026nbspDr Becker said: “We build on a lot of pre-existing literature and rather than finding some completely unique\u0026nbspnew result for children, we lend further evidence to the literature suggesting that children correlate with higher happiness under specific circumstances.”Researchers also found that marriage was “consistently positively correlated with wellbeing and lack of depressive symptoms”.The findings show social networks are also an important determinant for well-being and happiness – it is not just about being married or having children but\u0026nbsphaving people to share feelings and thoughts with too.“Taken together, our results suggest that social networks may be important for wellbeing and mental health in old age. Spouses, partners and children are often the basis of long-lasting social networks, which can provide social support to elderly people,” according to the study, published in Plos One.“While results on parenthood might be controversial and depend on the age of the studied population, there is widespread agreement that social support is associated with higher life satisfaction, and that social networks are an important factor for wellbeing.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A practice run fell 20mph short of the record, but conditions improved on the day and a tailwind helped.Changing the aerodynamics of the car was a balance, as it decreased the 4x4’s top speed, but reduced wind resistance when the bike was released.Mr Campbell laughed: “Porsche spend millions testing their cars in a wind tunnel and we stick a big Tupperware box on the back of it!”He was so desperate to break the record that he ditched a parachute designed to help him brake quickly before the end of the airfield – because it was causing turbulence.\u0026nbspBut he did wear the latest kangaroo-skin protective suit, which inflates in the event of a crash.His next challenge will be to try to reach 220mph next year on a six-mile track at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, USA.He said: “This has been a five-year programme and the record was the culmination of one part of it.“We have been bound by finances and budgeted to do what we can. Our plan is now to go to Bonneville and use a longer test track.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think Remain is the best option for the country and for my constituents.She denied Labour\u0027s position was chaotic, saying Mr Corbyn would be guided by the party membership\u0026nbspand the shadow cabinet over how to act.Ms Abbott added: I believe Jeremy will do what he has always done which is do what he thinks is best for the country and the Labour movement.Her comments come after Mr McDonnell said he believed that staying in the EU would be the best choice, a sentiment that was swiftly echoed by Ms Thornberry.Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell are long-standing allies of the Labour leader, and their position will heap pressure on Mr Corbyn to shift his Brexit stance.Meanwhile, the Labour leader has demanded the full publication of no-deal contingency plans after a leaked Whitehall dossier warned of months of shortages, chaos at borders and a possible recession.Speaking as he prepared to meet business leaders in Hertfordshire to discuss the potential impact of no deal, Mr Corbyn said: “The government’s own Operation Yellowhammer dossier makes the chaos and damage that will be caused by Boris Johnson’s no-deal Brexit crystal clear.“If the government wants to be believed that it doesn’t represent the real impact, it must publish its most recent assessments today in full. Boris Johnson’s denials can’t be trusted, and will do nothing to give businesses or consumers any confidence that the dire state of affairs described in these documents aren’t right around the corner.“What we know for sure is that this government is wilfully committed to a policy that the prime minister and the cabinet know will destroy jobs, push up food prices in the shops and open up our NHS to a takeover by US private companies.”Elsewhere, Boris Johnson accused Mr Corbyn of wanting to\u0026nbspargue about Brexit for years.The prime minister wrote on Twitter: Jeremy Corbyn wants to cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years.I am committed to leading our country forward and getting Britain out of the EU by October 31.We are ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal. But if you want a good deal for the UK, you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Khan said he was “very concerned” about plans to end free movement on day one of a no-deal Brexit. “I urge you strongly to reconsider,” he said.The London mayor continued: “I fear that such a

enormous contribution to our economic, cultural and civic life.“By putting the rights and freedoms of EU citizens in the UK at risk in such a careless and brutal fashion, these plans would be a

the UK, said in a statement: “The idea of ending freedom of movement abruptly on October 31 in case of no deal is reckless politics.“It hollows out the prime minister’s unequivocal guarantee to EU citizens he has given only three weeks ago. Ending freedom of movement without putting legal provisions in place for those EU citizens who have not yet successfully applied through the settlement scheme will mean that millions of lawful citizens will have their legal status removed overnight.“We have been calling for the settlement scheme to be a declaratory registration scheme, so all EU citizens who have made the UK their home are automatically granted status, as promised by those in government.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens and their families still have until at least December 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme, and 1 million people have already been granted status.“Freedom of movement as it currently stands will end on 31 October when the UK leaves the EU, and after Brexit the government will introduce a new, fairer immigration system that prioritises skills and what people can contribute to the UK, rather than where they come from.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although it was higher than a year ago, the 1.2 per cent annual rise still lagged behind inflation, which is running at 2.1 per cent, according to the latest official data.“There is little doubt that the market continues to face its inevitable challenges,” said Glynis Frew, chief executive of Hunters, an estate agency with over 200 branches across Britain.Official data showed last week that the average price at which homes are sold grew only 0.9 per cent in the year to June, while in London it tumbled by 2.7 per cent. The average British home cost £230,292 in June, down from a peak of £232,000 in August 2018.Buyers have been biding their time as it remains unclear whether the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal. In the latter case, house prices could plunge by almost 6 per cent in 2020 and another 3 per cent in 2021, according to forecasts by the government’s spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility.However, the more confident buyers are now abandoning the ‘wait and see’ approach and taking advantage of improved housing affordability as the Brexit deadline nears, Ms Frew said, commenting on Rightmove’s findings.For its latest report, Rightmove measured 130,435 asking prices, covering around 90 per cent of the UK market. The properties were put on sale by estate agents between 7 July to 10 August and advertised on rightmove.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is still not clear why those strange parts of the sky would behave in such an outstanding way.But researchers have now claimed that those spots of energy could be the consequence of conformal cyclic cosmology, a theory that suggests that our universe existed in another form before ours. They could have formed from black holes, the researchers suggest in a new paper.As such, those unexplained swirling areas in the sky could be the leftovers of another universe.“What we claim we’re seeing is the final remnant after a black hole has evaporated away in the previous aeon, Roger Penrose, a mathematical physicist at Oxford Universe and one of the authors of the study, told New Scientist, which first reported the news.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

That radiation could last from one version of the universe into the next, they claim.Strange flashes are coming from our nearest black hole, scientists sayThose places where the electromagnetic radiation was especially high\u0026nbsp– referred to as Hawking points – could therefore be left over from the previous universe.Those anomalous points would therefore be explained by what is known as CCC theory. Rather than being mysteriously glowing points, they would be the final evaporation of the supermassive black holes that were in the version of the universe that came before ours.Many scientists have objected to the idea of the cyclical universe, and Hawking radiation still remains to be confirmed.But the researchers say that they hope their analysis will at least help to give us a a significant initial indication of the nature of these anomalous regions and provides an important new input into cosmology, irrespective of the validity of CCC.And they conclude by suggesting that their findings will pose a significant problem for the conventional understanding of the universe, however they are formed.\u0026nbspIt is hard to see, however, that they find a natural explanation in the currently conventional inflationary picture, they write.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The couple draped huge garlands of flowers around one another\u0027s necks and relatives threw grains of yellow rice that caught in their dark hair.But even as they celebrated, they were already in danger.One bright afternoon less than a month later, the couple left a doctor\u0027s appointment in the small southern Indian city where they grew up.

He hacked Pranay twice on the head and neck, killing him instantly.Pranay, 23, was a Dalit, a term used to describe those formerly known as untouchables. Amrutha, 21, belongs to an upper caste.

A 2017 study found that just 5.8 per cent of Indian marriages are between people of different castes, a rate that has changed little in four decades. The results surprised the researchers, who had expected to see more intermingling of the different castes, said Tridip Ray, a statistician and the lead author. Unfortunately, that\u0027s not happening.In India, transgressing such boundaries sometimes provokes violence. Since late June, killings of men and women who married outside their caste have been reported in the states of Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. The daughter of a politician from India\u0027s ruling party recently posted a video on social media seeking protection from her father after she married a Dalit man against her family\u0027s wishes.The Bollywood movie that India’s upper caste is trying to banSuch violent reprisals are passed off in the name of tradition and honour, said Uma Chakravarti, a renowned historian and expert on caste and gender. But the motives go far deeper, she said. If a woman can choose whom she wants to marry - including a Dalit man - it destabilises the entire system that perpetuates inequality.On a recent morning, Amrutha - a slim young woman with a heart-shaped face - sat in the living room of the house she shares with Pranay\u0027s parents. Next to her was a screen showing images from closed-circuit cameras: the front door, the street, the corner where a large mango tree towers over the home. Her son, a plump 6-month-old with his father\u0027s smile, sat on her lap.The house sits near the edge of a Dalit neighbourhood and represents the middle-class stability won by Pranay\u0027s father, Balaswamy, who has worked as a clerk at the Life Insurance Corporation of India for the past three decades. Amrutha grew up a five-minute drive away in a large building owned by her father, a wealthy real estate developer in this city of 100,000 surrounded by rice mills in the state of Telangana.Dalits, who make up almost 17 per cent of India\u0027s population of more than 1.3 billion, are at the bottom of India\u0027s caste hierarchy. After centuries of subjugation, they have made inroads into politics, higher education and business, partly through affirmative action.But as Pranay and Amrutha\u0027s story shows, a modicum of upward mobility does not mean they can marry whom they want or live where they want. They continue to do India\u0027s most stigmatised and dangerous work. They face discrimination in the job market and huge hurdles in owning land.\u0026nbspIndia has given one person one vote, said Paul Divakar, general secretary of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights. But it has not given each human being the same value.When Amrutha started high school, her parents told her not to make friends with girls from lower castes, particularly Dalits, who are officially referred to as Scheduled Castes. Amrutha\u0027s family are Arya Vysya, a group that is part of the Komati caste, traditionally a trading community.The complexities of the Indian caste system were far from Amrutha\u0027s mind when she went to a movie in the ninth grade with a group of friends. She recognised Pranay from school, where he was a year ahead of her, jovial and athletic. Afterwards, they started texting and talking over the phone.Their growing friendship had immediate consequences. When Amrutha\u0027s father found out, she said, he beat her for the first - but not the last - time. He took away her mobile phone and laptop and moved her to a different school. Over the next six years, Amrutha and Pranay would see each other only briefly on a handful of occasions.For Amrutha\u0027s father, the marriage of his only daughter was an obsession. I can even marry you to a beggar who belongs to an upper caste, Amrutha remembers him telling her. But I don\u0027t want you to marry from a lower caste, whoever it is.When the two were in college - Pranay pursuing an engineering degree and Amrutha studying fashion - she became frightened that her parents were manoeuvring to marry her to someone else. She got word to Pranay that she wanted to elope.On 30 January 2018, when her mother went for a midday rest, Amrutha picked up a backpack she had prepared. It contained a cream-coloured dress she had received for her birthday, her school certificates and her identity card. She went down the stairs to the street, where Pranay was waiting, just as he had promised.Amrutha and Pranay were afraid, but they had a plan. They submitted their applications for passports and studied for an English proficiency test. They hoped to go to Australia and perhaps realise Pranay\u0027s dream of starting a business - a fashion studio or even a dairy farm.The couple had married in the presence of only a few friends at a temple in Hyderabad run by the Arya Samaj, a Hindu reformist group known for its openness to inter-caste unions. About five months later, Amrutha discovered she was pregnant, so they postponed the idea of leaving home. They also decided to organise a reception to celebrate their marriage.Hundreds of people attended the festivities on 17 August 2018, but Amrutha\u0027s parents were notably absent. Rao, her father, had already begun to plot Pranay\u0027s murder, court documents say. The month before, he agreed to pay $150,000 (£124,000) to have his son-in-law killed, using a local political leader as an intermediary. Rao, 57, passed along a photo of the pair from their reception invitation to make it easier for the killers to identify Pranay, the documents allege.On 14 September, Amrutha, Pranay and his mother Premalatha were leaving Jyothi Hospital after an appointment with Amrutha\u0027s obstetrician. In video captured by a closed-circuit camera, the couple looked relaxed as they chatted and strolled towards the street. The killer walked up behind them and struck two blows. The video shows Amrutha raising her hands to her head in shock and confusion, then running, crying, back to the hospital for help.Before she fainted, she called her father. Somebody attacked Pranay, she said. What did you do?The murder ided Miryalaguda. Hundreds of people, mostly Dalits, came to the home of Pranay\u0027s family after his death to extend their support. They discussed installing a small statue of the young man to memorialise him.Chilukuri said his group was not formed to support Amrutha\u0027s father. He paused for a moment. Do you want to meet him? He picked up his phone and called Rao, who is out on bail pending the start of his trial, which is expected to begin by September.Indian judge claims upper-caste Brahmins \u0027should always be at helm\u0027Former \u0027untouchable\u0027 man beaten by police after reporting wife\u0027s rapeIndia moves to open up job quotas to upper castes for first timeDeaths as members of India\u0027s lowest caste protest against new law‘Honour killings’ hotline launched to protect mixed-caste couplesAmrutha\u0027s father was around the corner at a small cafe. A short, paunchy man with a moustache and gold-rimmed glasses, Rao sat down briefly with a reporter at a small plastic table but declined to speak on the record, citing legal advice. His lawyer, Ravinder Reddy, declined to comment. In the 56-page main charging document, police cite overwhelming evidence linking Rao to the murder and say he confessed to the crime on 30 September.A V Ranganath, the superintendent of police for Nalgonda district, said the politician who acted as a middleman between Rao and the killers had inadvertently activated the automatic call-recording feature on his Android phone. Such recordings will be quite helpful in court, Ranganath said.Pranay\u0027s father Balaswamy, 53, said the family wants to see Rao punished to deter future such killings. As he spoke, he cradled his grandson Nihan in the crook of his arm, holding the baby\u0027s chin with one hand to better plant an affectionate kiss on his cheek. Balaswamy can be seen using the exact same gesture for Pranay in a video taken during his son\u0027s wedding reception less than a year ago.When it came time to deliver the couple\u0027s baby, the family decided that for safety reasons it was better to go to a hospital in Hyderabad, a major city three hours away. But when the family sought a temporary apartment there, Balaswamy said, several landlords declined to rent to them after learning they were Dalits. Caste discrimination is something we are facing regularly, he said.Amrutha says Pranay\u0027s parents are now like her own. My father was the reason for his death, she said. But Pranay\u0027s parents know how we loved each other.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He is pictured with a Wodens Folk flag on every page of their blog.Similarly, Troy Southgate, who was in the National Front, also edits Wodenist literature.Shockingly, the rituals being performed by Wodens Folk at historic sites are just the latest example of an extreme group carrying out Odinist ceremonies on British soil, believed to be on the rise since the BNP collapsed a decade ago.Wodens Folk was founded in  by Geoffrey Dunn, a pensioner from East Sussex who calls himself Wulf Ingessunu.The group styles itself as the vanguard of the English Revolution who want to reclaim ancient English sites.There are believed to be around  people who associate with the group and theyre understood to hold around four meetings every year.Their rambling blog says their mission is to take back this Holy Land from the forces of decay and destruction. Proud of our Land – Proud of our Folk – Proud of our Blood!Some of the rhetoric the group has used has led to accusations of racism and neo-Nazism, which they deny.A Wodens Folk blog says: We oppose the multi-racial society where ious dferent ‘communities’ vie for a slice of the cake in a decaying and dying nation.This evil system has produced a hell-on-earth in which crime, violence, perversion and subversion are re.On a related site, they wrote: This is why our enemies have taken control of the Summer Sunwend at Stonehenge, Avebury and Glastonbury, as well as incursions into Waylands Smithy, Rollright Stones and other important Holy Sites around England.But as you take back the streets of England, so shall we take back these Ancient and Holy Sites around rural England.The groups founder reportedly boasted that the group had held rituals at English Heritage-managed Waylands Smithy more times than he could remember, since at least .Patrik Hermansson, , spent a year infiltrating far-right groups in the UK and America to expose them.As part of his undercover activities, Hope Not Hate researcher Patrik attended an Odinist neo-Nazi ceremony with members of London Forum two years ago. London Forum is an extreme right organisation, previously described as white supremacist.The group travelled to a field outside the capital where one person, equipped with a horn and ancient Scandinavian texts, led the ceremony.Patrik tells Sun Online: He had two horns: one for drinking, and another for blowing in to make a sound.And then he also had some sort of mead.The ritual began with the leader blowing the horn in every direction as the attendees stood in a circle.Patrik says it then mostly consisted of readings from Scandinavian texts.He adds: After that you have a bit of a ritual where you say every one of Odin’s names.Odin has a lot of names as part of that tradition, he has over a hundred names.They then passed the drinking horn round, prayed to Odin before taking a sip, and poured the last bit on the ground.Originally from Sweden but now living in London, Patrik befriended neo-Nazis in order to identy their anonymous figureheads and uncover connections between groups.As theyre desperate to align themselves with Scandinavia, Patrik was welcomed with open arms.He says that Odinism is a convenient spiritual propaganda for the far-rights darker ideals.They don’t like Christianity. Christianity is too egalitarian, too forgiving, he says.These people often perceive the white race, Aryans, as having roots somewhere in Scandinavia often adding mythological elements to it in order to set the supposed Aryan race apart from others.”Patrik says neo-Nazis hijack Odinism in order to make their followers even more prone to violence.He said: “The glorication of an honourable possible death in war — that has a very practical purpose in violent groups.It partly helps to justy the use of violence when you add religious elements to it and by adding this mythology on it also explains and justies martyrdom, essentially dying for the cause.”Tacking a religion on to their political beliefs also ensures members of neo-Nazi groups end up increasingly isolated from wider society.It focuses on the myths of the Northern European peoples, including the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings.And while Odinists usually worship many gods, Odin is often considered central to their beliefs.Odin, the father of Thor, was associated with many things in Norse mythology, including war, wisdom, death and victory.He is also known by hundreds of dferent names - Wednesday is named after Woden, which is the Old English name for him.Although there are many people who practice Odinism as an open-to-all religion that has nothing to do with race, others make racist ideas essential in their practice.In England, far-right Odinists see themselves as descended from indigenous English folk who were in turn Vikings and Anglo-Saxons.Thats why they seek to resurrect the ancient mythology, which they see as the rightful religion of the Aryan race.The Nazis used similar tropes of a fictional, Aryan master race in Germany in the s to gain supporters and murder people of other races, ultimately leading to the Holocaust.Some experts believe that since the BNP collapsed, far-right groups have become progressively broken-up.Professor Matthew Feldman, director of the Centre for Analysis of the Radical Right, told thethat this fragmentation has allowed them to become more extreme.Of the neo-Nazis Patrik met, he said many of them seemed to be predisposed towards wanting a religion of sorts in their lives.He says: It doesn’t mean that they actually go out and do ceremonies – that is relatively rare — but they might have read a few texts and identy with that and use symbols associated with Odinsim.He adds: Some were probably a little bit spiritual, looking for something before, I imagine.Others came more from this kind of purely Scandiphilia, Aryanism obsession with Scandinavia.In a recent statement on its blog, Wodens Folk denied being neo-Nazi or fascistic, and said they group is not racist and does not espouse racist views but upholds a love of our own folk.They also stressed that their movement is fundamentally religious and not politically orientated, and strenuously denied being responsible for the Swastika tree carvings at Waylands Smithy and stressed they have never damaged a heathen sacred site.And they denied having any association with terrorists who were labelled Odinist.Wodens Folk also said it does not involve itself in any political action, evenits supporters do.A spokesman for the National Trust said that whilst they have been aware of some far-right activity at Avebury they had had no knowledge of the rituals being held at the burial chamber.They said that whilst they “want everyone to feel welcome” they “don’t condone, support or encourage any non-peaceful, anti-social or illegal activities at any of our places”."},{"url":null,"title":"baby scarred slashed face scalpel c section claims","story":"Amber Woollard, , claims docs said newborn Valenci suffered a deformity from her position in the womb.But she says a midwe and a plastic surgeon later said the two inch cut under her tot’s nose could not have happened naturally.Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital said it is “very unlikely” to have been caused by a scalpel.A spokesperson said: Wed like to repeat our apologies to Ms Woollard for not meeting her expectations and the distress caused following the birth of her daughter.We are sorry that her daughter was born with signs of facial trauma and we have explained to Ms Woollard why we believe the facial marks were very unlikely to have been caused by the scalpel used during the caesarean section.Wed be happy to talk to Ms Woollard furthershe has any further questions or concerns.Surgeons expect Valenci will need three surgeries in the coming years.Amber, from Norwich said: I see this as a case of serious case of neglect from the NHS.My darling daughter has been left with scars for the rest of her le because of this.

But there is now no prospect of Yellowhammer’s national emergency. By Halloween, we will be ready to go.There will be no public demand for bird-spotter Ken Clarke to volunteer as caretaker PM “once I find out what the Devil’s going on”.We now have TWO Magic Grandpas!

Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown. It will be rebel MPs versus the democratically expressed wishes of their own voters.Boris Johnson will not resignhe loses a confidence vote. He will call a general election immediately after Britain has left the EU on October .There is talk about a challenge to the Supreme Court but judges are unlikely to intervene against a PM executing the will of the people.

I can barely walk, sleep or sit.Nurses have been cleaning and dressing his wounds on a daily basis, the worst part of Williams day.Its the worst, they like the blisters to burst, he said.William said he told his date hed had an accident, and that theyd have to postpone their get-together for at least three weeks.Veets website advises: Any kind of reaction is extremely rare, but we always recommend testing on a small area of your skin  hours ahead of intended use.William confessed: I didnt know there was a mens bottle.It was a little stupid of me, I know, and laughable I guess. Initially I found the whole thing funny, until I realised how bad it is.The pain and discomfort it has caused is far from funny.I guess Ive formed a kind of anger towards Veet.But Im also shocked that such bad injury can occur from a product readily available.If you deviated slightly from the instructions, you can cause serious damage.A spokesperson for Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Veet, said: We are sorry to hear of the reaction a customer has had to a Veet hair removal cream product and we wish the gentleman a speedy recovery as soon as possible.As the health and safety of our consumers is a top priority for us, we ensure all Veet products meet stringent safety standards.We strongly recommend that customers read and follow all the instructions on the packaging and product labels for safe use."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn speech journalists boo heckled","story":"The Labour boss couldnt hide his smile as activists at a speech interrupted reporters and shouted them down.In a speech in Corby today Mr Corbyn confirmed he WOULD bring a vote of no confidence in Boris Johnson - but admitted that he wasnt entirely surehe could win it.He begged MPs who wanted to stop a No Deal Brexit to join him in bringing Boris down - and got a standing ovation from his devoted supporters.But during the QA session afterwards the press conference descended into chaos as audience members started shouting out and attacking reporters for questioning him.The heckling came as:Today Mr Corbyn was asked whether he would be able to step aside for another caretaker PMhe didnt have the support.But before he could even answer, several people in the audience cried: No!Mr Corbyn smiled and said: Let Andy ask his question. Hes a nice fella, its alright.But one heckler yelled: What a disgrace!Another shouted from the back: He is our leader, not the press, not Boris Johnson, or Jo Swanson!Another reporter was shouted at as he quizzed the Labour boss on whether he had enough cross-party support from MPs.And activists replied with: Shame on you!There seems to be an awful lot of whataboutery in the press at the current time, Mr Corbyn added in another hit at the media.An ITV reporter asked him why he felt people in his own party didnt want him to lead a government of national unity, but was then booed by hecklers.Mr Corbyn tried to intervene, saying: “No, Let Andy ask his question, please! I am defending your right to speak here.Another heckler muttered “Media lies.”The Labour boss is set to host Opposition MPs next week for a crunch stop No Deal summit, John McDonnell revealed today.The Labour boss also confirmed today that he wanted Boris Johnson to cancel the rest of MPs holiday and drag them back to Westminster to sort out Brexit.Thats despite the fact that more than MPs voted to go on holiday just a few weeks ago.Today No slapped down the chances of a recall and said it wasnt going to happen.James Cleverly MP, Conservative Party Chairman, said of Mr Corbyns speech today:  Jeremy Corbyn has everything he can to frustrate Britain leaving the EU on October st, and now he has confirmed he is willing to cancel the referendum result. Politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.Corbyn would wreck the economy, he won’t keep our streets safe and his only answer to Brexit is more delay causing more confusion – showing he’s more interested in playing cynical party political games than respecting the referendum result.Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are committed to delivering Brexit by October st, whatever happens, so that we can deliver the change that our country needs and the people voted for.He’s spent his le appealing to the same tiny band, and until the past few years has never been trusted with the slightest genuine responsibility.He’s been able to spout off about everything from the IRA to the Middle East without ever having to actually act on his wrong-headed convictions.And, with Corbyn now Leader of the Opposition, his mindless and dangerous cult brook no dissent. Labour MPs who disagree with him are Tories in disguise.The media daring to ask him questions are “a disgrace”, as one of his barmy army put it yesterday. Voting Conservative makes you just plain evil.The contrast between Magic Grandpa and Boris couldn’t be clearer. While the latter can deliver a good gag, his record also bears the most serious scrutiny. Two terms as Mayor of London. A former Foreign Secretary.The only person around Corbyn with the slightest experience of actual power is his Shadow Chancellor. That’s John McDonnell, who was fired as London’s finance chief by Ken Livingstone for being too left wing, which is some feat…So when Corbyn claims to be a more serious, trustworthy figure than the current Prime Minister Give over, Jezza."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NINTCHDBPICT0005145960","title":"inside lord mountbatten marriage","story":"But behind closed doors, their -year marriage was far from perfect – with Lord Mountbatten once admitting: “Edwina and I spent all our married lives getting into other people’s beds.”A stunning but highly-strung socialite, Edwina - who was named the sixth best dressed woman in the world at the time - had at least  lovers including Indian Prime Minister Nehru and singer Leslie Hutch Hutchinson, who she once gted a jewel-encrusted penis sheath.She was said to be sexually obsessed, once being thrusted across a banquet table during a romp with one lover.Lord Mountbatten - who Prince Louis is widely-believed to be named after  - was ‘devastated’ by her infidelity in the early days of their marriage.But realising he had little choice in the matter, he began taking lovers of his own, too.Yesterday, FBI documents from the s revealed shocking claims that Mountbatten - who was murdered by an IRA bomb  years ago this month -  was secretly “a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.”In the documents, the couple are described as “persons of extremely low morals” and many have suggested both were bisexual - a huge taboo at the time.Here, we delve into their controversial marriage.The great-grandson of Queen Victoria, Mountbatten – the uncle of Prince Philip – was born in  at Frogmore House, Windsor as Prince Louis of Battenberg, a title he lost when he and other royals dropped Germanic names during World War I.By the time he met -year-old Edwina Ashley, in , she was a leading light in London society with an inheritance of £millionfrom her grandfather, financier Ernest Cassel, to fund her party lestyle.Their wedding, at St Margaret’s chapel, Westminster, attracted a crowd of , and was attended by many members of the royal family including Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra and the then Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII.Both were virgins when they wed but Edwina soon revealed her love of sex when she asked to go to Paris on their honeymoon so they could explore “the most awful places we could find”.Louis found sex less appealing, calling it a mixture of psychology and hydraulics.He was so awkward in bed he was said to have named her breasts Mutt and Jeff - naval slang for medals.Louis - affectionately known by his family as Dickie - was often away with the navy and cracks began to show in their marriage after the birth of their first daughter, Patricia, in .Edwina was so jealous of the attention the baby got that she packed her off to a nanny the South Coast and embarked on a series of affairs.She soon surrounded herself with a harem of lovers she referred to as “ginks” – including Lord Molyneux, a rich American polo player called Laddie Sandford and newspaper editor Mike Wardell.Daughter Pamela Hicks later revealed that several admirers were often in tow at the same time, and even had to be kept apart at the family home, Broom House in Park Lane.“When my mother ed from shopping one day she was met with, Mr Larry Gray is in the drawing room, Mr Sandford is in the library, Mr Ted Phillips is in the boudoir, Señor Portago [is] in the anteroom and I don’t know what to do with Mr Molyneux’,” she wrote.Divorce, especially within the Royal family, was frowned upon and Pamela said the fallout was “messy and complex.”“When my father first heard that she had taken a lover, he was devastated,” she said. “But eventually, using their reserves of deep mutual affection, my parents managed to negotiate a way through this crisis and found a modus vivendi .”The pair agreed to a ‘discreet’ open marriage and Pamela said that her father’s “total desire for my mother’s happiness” was what made the marriage work.When her husband was posted to Malta, in the early s, Edwina enjoyed a fling with American golfer Bobby Sweeney.For his part, in , Dickie began to flirt with -year-old Margaret Whigham, the future Duchess Of Argyll – who became notorious for her own sex scandal in , when she was photographed performing a sex act on an unknown man.He finally entered into a long term affair with Yola Letellier, the boyish Frenchwoman who inspired Colettes  novella, Gigi.But the biggest scandal of the couple’s marriage was about to break.Its reported that pair were the “talk of the West End” and the scandal had “shaken society to its very depth”, causing the woman to be “exiled” by royal command.The woman was soon identied as Edwina – who had recently joined her husband in Malta – and the man was wrongly thought to be singer and activist Paul Robeson.After a court case held in secret, the paper finally apologised and offered “genuine and deep regrets”.But many believe Edwina’s real lover was the suave and famously well-endowed West Indian cabaret singer and pianist, Leslie ‘Hutch’ Hutchinson, who was becoming notorious for bedding society women.The bisexual entertainer - who had lost his childhood innocence when his father took him to a brothel at the age of  - had arrived in London in the s after being discovered by Cole Porter.“Edwina interrupted Hutch playing the piano,” he says. “She kissed his neck and led him by the hand behind the closed doors of the dining-room. There was a shriek, and a few minutes later she ed, straightening her clothes.“Hutch seemed elated, and before he ed to the piano, told me that, with one thrust, he had flashed [propelled] her theof the dining-room table.”Lady Mountbatten was said to be so besotted that she showered him with gts, including a jewelled gold cigarette case, a gold ring engraved with her coat of arms, a gold and diamond watch and – outrageously – a Cartier, jewel-encrusted penis sheath.One disputed story surrounding the pair was that they were once locked in a sexual position when Edwina suffered from vaginismus - a condition that makes the vagina clamp around a penis - and the couple had to be separated at hospital.One night, an inebriated Mountbatten fell into Quaglino’s restaurant and told the bandleader, Van Straten:  “I am lonely and sad and drunk... Hutch has a p**** like a tree-trunk, and he’s f****** my we right now.”Although he was cast out of royal circles over the scandal, Hutch would go on to put another two royal notches on his bedpost, enjoying a fling with Princess Marina and, allegedly, with Princess Margaret in , when she was  and he was .Bizarrely, on Hutchs death in , Mountbatten rang the funeral directors offering to pay for his headstone and grave in Highgate Cemetery.After the court case Edwina moved on to Colonel Harold ‘Bunny Phillips’ of the Coldstream Guard who she met on a cruise - after allegedly bedding his older brother Ted.He was ft in and “thrillingly handsome” according to Pamela, who was nine when they met.“He would stay with us for long periods of time and, to us children, he was part of everyday le.”In , Lord Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy of India and charged with overseeing the country’s transition to India and the couple moved to Delhi.There, Edwina was to find her most enduring love affair - with Indian Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru who, at , was ten years her senior.Pamela later said her father condoned the relationship, called them a “happy threesome.”As Mountbatten himself wrote to his daughter Patricia, “She and Jawaharlalare so sweet together, they really dote on each other.”Some believe the couple also indulged in threesomes, as Dickie tried to rekindle the spark with Edwina.When the Mountbattens left India, in , Edwina wouldto visit yearly and Nehru would make an annual trip to London whenever she was there.In between, they wrote long love letters to each other.As Edwina became increasingly close to Nehru, new rumours were beginning to circulate about Lord Mountbatten.The FBI had interviewed several people who claimed the naval commander was bisexual, with one claiming he had a fetish for “young boys”.The first FBI files date back to February , soon after Mountbatten had become supreme allied commander of southeast Asia.It reads: Lord Louis Mountbatten and his we are considered persons of extremely low morals.It also said there were claims that Lord Louis Mountbatten was known to be a homosexual with a perversion for young boys.Homosexual acts were banned in the UK until , and many memos about Mountbattens sexuality have been edited or destroyed since.But in the new book – The Mountbattens: Their Lives and Loves - Anthony Daly, a rent boy to the rich and famous during the s, claims Dickie’s friend Tom Driberg, told him, that “Mountbatten had something of a fetish for unorms — handsome young men in military unormsand beautul boys in school unorm.”Ron Perks, Mountbatten’s driver in Malta in , also told author Lownie he often took him to the Red House near Rabat, which “was an upmarket gay brothel used by senior naval officers”.Edwina died in , at the age of , from unknown causes - with a pile of Nehrus letters by her bed - and Pamela said Dickie remained loyal to the end.“To her dying day, he was always worrying that Mummy would orce him,” she wrote. “But although she said she had no time for royalty and that she was a true socialist, Mummy would never have left him.“Try keeping her away from a party at Buckingham Palace.”Lord Mountbatten was assassinated in an IRA bomb attack in  in Ireland , that also killed his his -year-old grandson Nicholas, Patricia’s mother-in-law Lady Bradbourne and a -year-old crew member, Paul Maxwell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will be beheaded.John Letts says he begged his son to come home, telling him: A father should never live to see his son buried.He went on to accuse him of being a pawn ... helping spread hatred, pain, anger, suffering and violence.Letts was entitled to citizenship through his Canadian father John but was born in the UK and grew up in rural Oxfordshire with HIS organic farmer dad and British mum Sally.Sources said the Canadian government had “gone berserk” at Britain ripping up Letts passport.Office of Public Safety minister Ralph Goodale said: “Terrorism knows no borders, so countries need to keep each other safe.“Canada is disappointed the United Kingdom has taken this action to offload their responsibilities.”It is thought the decision to revoke his citizenship was one of the last actions of Theresa May’s administration."},{"url":null,"title":"jeffrey epstein prince andrew shady pals","story":"The Queen’s silliest son has been friends with Jeffrey Epstein for many years.Andrew even invited the convicted paedophile to Sandringham House, her private home in Norfolk.Grotesque Epstein was convicted of securing a child for prostitution in  and served  months in prison.Last month Epstein was charged again, for sex trafficking of minors, and on August  he killed himself in prison.But Andrew is loyal to his awful friends.He met Epstein even AFTER his  conviction. They were photographed walking in New York’s Central Park after Epstein’s conviction for securing a child for prostitution.Andrew apparently had to reassure the Queen personally he did not have relations with underage girls, though he was photographed with his arm round one of Epstein’s accusers. What a conversation that must have been.“Air-miles Andy” has long been an embarrassment to the Royal Family and the country, the best possible argument for getting rid of the monarchy.He likes to travel by helicopter to events he could just as easily reach by car.He once took a £, helicopter trip from Windsor to West Sussex, which is less than an hour and a half by car. But his profligacy is just the start.His role as a “special trade representative” from  to  cost the public £million including travel and police protection. One trip to America by private jet cost £,.And he wasn’t very good at it. Wikileaks revealed the US ambassador to Kyrgyzstan wrote of Andrew’s diplomacy: “Rude language a la British . . .  turned to the general issue of promoting British economic interests abroad.He railed at British anti-corruption investigators who had the ‘idiocy’ of almost scuttling the al-Yamamahdeal with Saudi Arabia.”Former minister Chris Bryant said of Andrew: “When I was at the Foreign Office, it was very dficult to see in whose interests he was acting.“He doesn’t exactly add lustre to the Royal diadem.”He lives in luxury with his similarly profligate and foolish ex-we Sarah at Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park, which was renovated at a cost of £million when he moved in.His family are supported by the Queen’s income from the privy purse and the Duchy of Lancaster. In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist. But being Duke of York and a Knight of the Order of the Garter should mean something.If Andrew were heir to the throne, the monarchy would fall over this. He should think about that —he thinks at all. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Central to this is the ongoing downturn in industry.”Exports “were down substantially”, the bank noted, as pre-Brexit preparations ahead of the UK’s initial exit date at the end of March  led to companies building up stocks in the first quarter.Bundesbank added: As things currently stand, it is unclear whether exports and, by extension, industry will regain their footing before the domestic economy becomes more severely affected.”Although economists have not yet predicting a Europe-wide recession, they have voiced fears that the European Union will not thrive while its power economy is struggling.Germany accounts for more than a quarter of the EUs output, with its  million people.Many of the blocs countries count Germany as their number one trading partner.This includes France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia, Sweden and Italy.Katharina Utermöhl, senior economist at the German insurer Allianz, told the New York Times: If the largest member state is affected, this will also start to weigh on the euro area as a whole because of the close economic relations.”She added that, should Europe suffer more blows such as a no-deal Brexit, the risk of a recession is rather high.It comes ahead of Boris Johnsons crunch talks with Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron in Paris this week.The PM believes Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel will cave and broker a new Brexit deal.This is despite Brussels chiefs saying repeatedly they will not reopen talks over a fresh deal.Speaking during a visit to a hospital in Cornwall yesterday, Boris told Sky News: We will be ready to come out on Oct.  - deal or no deal.“Of course, our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel are showing a little bit of reluctance to change their position - thats fine - I am confident that they will.I hope that they will compromise - they have seen that the UK parliament has three times rejected the Withdrawal Agreement, the backstop just doesnt work, it is not democratic. I hope they will see fit to compromise.The PM has stated that we will be leaving the bloc “do or die” by the Halloween deadline and has won the backing of Brexiteers for his tough stance against Brussels – refusing to meet any EU leaders in person until now.However, Boris has also said that brokering a trade deal with the EU is a top priority.He said: “I want a deal, we are ready to work with our friends and partners to get a deal butyou want a good deal for the UK you must simultaneously get ready to come out without one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh festival best joke tourettes charity complains","story":"The Dave Award went to Swedish comedian Olaf Falafel for his joke: “Have you heard about the man who kept shouting broccoli and caullower  He thought he might have florets.”But Suzanne Dobson, chief executive of the UK Tourette’s Action charity, was not laughing and called the joke “rubbish”, claiming it had brought “shame” on TV channel Dave.She said: “Not only is it not funny to poke fun at people with Tourette’s, it’s not even that funny a joke, is it ”Ms Dobson said: “I would ask them to walk in the shoes of somebody with Tourette’s for a day, and then tell methey find it quite so amusing.”She also said the charity had several calls from parents, who said their children with Tourette’s syndrome had been angered and upset by the joke.The charity had been about to launch a campaign to stop Tourette’s being used as a punchline, which Ms Dobson said was “unfortunately about a week too late”.Kate Stone, one of the lists who shortlisted Falafel’s joke for the award, said: “It’s a good one, it’s a pun, everyone kind of recognises it as it’s intended to be a joke and I think that’s one of the things that matters the most for this.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are appealing to anyone who has information about Nora to help us find her.A reward of £, - donated by an anonymous Belfast business - is made available for information leading to Noras safe .August : A body is found and police said Noras parents confirmed it was her .August : An initial post-mortem examination inconclusiveAugust : Post-mortem finds that Nora died of intestinal bleeding after a stomach ulcer burst, probably caused by hunger and stress.Nora’s uncle Pacome Quoirin also voiced his concern that any criminal element had been ruled out on Thursday.“How could she have survived for five days in the jungle without food or water,you believe the theory that she left the hotel on her own  We remain very dubious, said the graphic designer.“The findings that were announced in no way discredit a criminal act. She could have been kidnapped and fed at the beginning. There is insufficient evidence to jump to definitive conclusions.”The familys lawyer Charles Morel said Noras parents were treating the autopsy results with caution and were not ruling out any criminal aspect to her disappearance.He told Irish broadcaster RTE: We have to be very cautious about the interpretation of the first result of the autopsy.The risk is thatyou exclude the criminal hypothesis, its too early to say that.Nora was very shy, dependent on her mother and its not in her temperament to go out in the night after a long trip in a place she doesnt know, in the jungle, said Morel.He added: And even the place where she was found, two kilometres from the resort, very strange that she could go there by herself alone so we cannot exclude the criminal hypothesis.The family still finds it dficult to understand that she would have gone into the jungle on her own.Mr Morel said the family are waiting for the results of DNA analysis, which they hope to have quickly.I know the family is very traumatised. They loved their daughter, she was an angel, he said.But they are now concerned about the truth because they owe that to Nora, what happened, how did she die.The familys lawyer also stated that Malaysian authorities may tend to favour the theory of a disappearance over the criminal hypothesis in lieu of Malaysias good image for tourism.The post-mortem ruled the teen had died from internal bleeding in her intestine after a stomach ulcer burst, following a period of prolonged hunger and stress.Both the Irish and French police who observed the postmortem were satisfied with the work of the local pathology team led by Siew Sheue Feng from the Kuala Lumpur Hospital.Negeri Sembilan Police Chief, Mohamad Mat Yusop, today said authorities had found no evidence of foul play and said the post-mortem also found she had not been sexually abused.The officer told the Malay Mail that the area where Nora was eventually found had been searched and she may have been moving around as rescue teams tried to locate her.“We will continue to investigate and find out what really happened,” he said.Vulnerable Nora - who was born with the brain defect holoprosencephaly - is believed to have been dead for up to three days before being found in a spot search crews had already examined.Prior to the post-mortem findings, French prosecutors had joined the probe - as Noras father is French - to investigate whether the teen was kidnapped before her death.Mr Morel told Le Parisien that the parents had filed a complaint “for kidnapping and were convinced her disappearance is of criminal origin.Her family paid tribute to the youngster and also thanked people across the world for their support.Nora has brought people together, especially from France, Ireland, Britain and Malaysia, united in their love and support for her and her family.To all our friends and family at home, we cant thank you enough for all your love.Nora is at the heart of our family. She is the truest, most precious girl and we love her infinitely. We will always love our Nora.It is understood Nora had been wearing underwear when she went missing – but police said when she was found she was “completely naked”.The officer who has been leading the hunt, Datuk Mazlan Mansor, said she was found in a stream running through a ravine, adding: The stream was about .km deep in the ravine,” he said.A volunteer taking part in the search, Sean Yeap, revealed that the body had not been covered in any foliage.Noras parents visited the site where her body was found and later identied her body at the Tuanku Jaafar Hospital.The family are now making plans to bring Noras body back to the UK.State Women, Family Affairs and Welfare Committee chairman Nicole Tan Lee Koon said Noras mum had conveyed her wishes to the countrys Deputy Prime Minister Datin Seri Dr Wan AzizahThe teenager was discovered missing from her bedroom at the Dusun eco-resort in southern Negeri Sembilan state on the morning of Sunday August , with the window left open.She was on trip of a letime with her family including sister Innes,  and brother Maurice, eight, at the time of her disappearance.The teen had only arrived the day earlier with her parents and two siblings at the resort in a nature reserve near Seremban,  miles south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.Noras parents are an Irish-French couple who have lived in London for about  years.The Dusun is a -acre orchard resort next to the Berembun Forest Reserve -

Not for a moment did they envisage having to act on it.The letter was — like almost everything Mr Corbyn has ever said or done — about posturing rather than acting. The Labour leader spent  years as a backbencher before his elevation to being Leader of the Opposition.During those three decades he achieved precisely nothing.Had he not been elected leader, the few people to have been aware of his existence would have known him as a minor fringe MP who hung out with terrorists and racists.The sum total of his contribution to politics as a backbencher was to have proposed  Early Day Motions, the parliamentary equivalent of tweeting.Topics which he considered worth his time included “seal genitalia”, “Disney children’s pyjamas” and an MI proposal to use pigeons as flying bombs.Mr Corbyn’s natural disposition is to tear down, to criticise and to oppose.He could not even bring himself to support his own party when it was in power, voting against the last Labour government  times.There is not a single piece of legislation that owes anything to his contribution.This is the context in which his and Labour’s seemingly incoherent stance on Brexit — one day against another referendum, another day for one one day for Brexit, another day for Remain — must be seen.He is uninterested in the mechanics of a concrete solution. He has no real views on the details of Brexit or even how we get there.For Mr Corbyn, Brexit is a means to an end — which is as a vehicle to power.That is why, for example, he has on  occasions instructed Labour MPs either to abstain or to vote with the Government on Brexit, rather than attempting in any serious way to force the Government to change course, either over the type or Brexit on offer or a second referendum.He wants Brexit.He and his coterie of revolutionary socialists believe that leaving without a deal will be chaotic and that in that chaos Labour will be swept into office.But that, by definition, requires Brexit both to happen and to be chaotic.Most of his party take a dferent view — most are Remainers — so every so often the Corbynites view it as tactically wise to offer the appearance of wanting to work against the Government’s version of Brexit.Hence yesterday’s letter. But it is all meaningless posing. In her speech yesterday rejecting Mr Corbyn’s demand that she support him as PM, Jo Swinson hit the nail on the head.She said: “In my first week as leader of the Liberal Democrats I called on Jeremy Corbyn to table a vote of no confidence in the Government and I asked him to table it before summer recess, because that was the only way to be sure we could hold an election before crashing out on the st of October.”You do not have to share Ms Swinson’s opposition to Brexit to accept that her analysis is spot on.Mr Corbyn refused to table such a vote of no confidence at the end of July. Had he actually wanted to avoid No Deal, he would have done.There was every chance Boris Johnson’s new government would have lost and we would now be in the middle of an election campaign.Whatever the outcome of that election, we would not — as we are now — be spending time analysing the prospects of a so-called government of national unity or looking at cynical letters written by the Labour leader.Mr Corbyn and his allies doubtless think they are being extremely clever, riding two horses at the same time.But his problem is that every time he opens his mouth, the unsuitability for office becomes ever clearer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It shows a transformation in the approach, that Boris Johnson is willing to leave on a fixed date with no question of extension.“It’s the do-or-die pledge in black and white. It’s not merely symbolic.

in a hint they wouldnt back him to be PMit came down to it.The letter was the most positive reaction to Mr Corbyns call, which was rejected by all sides of the political spectrum.But Tories reacted with fury at the idea that their own side was talking to the Opposition at all.Iain Duncan Smith told The Sun: It’s contemptible than anyone would talk to an anti Semitic Marxist about possibly forming a government.And he wrote in thetoday that trying to stop Brexit would be the true betrayal.The thought that anyone would listen to this man, who stood on a manesto in  to deliver on the vote to leave the EU while opposed to a second referendum, but who now declares he is in favour of a second referendum, is ludicrous, he wrote.The message to those like Mr Hammond who want to block Brexit and to those who would do deals with Mr Corbyn to block Brexit is this: leaving with no deal isn’t a betrayal of the British people, but trying to stop it is.Mr Corbyns plot to take power as a caretaker PM to delay Brexit again and call a fresh election has been slapped down by most of the opposition MPs - who said they will refuse to work with him.The Liberal Democrats, Greens, SNP and Plaid all agreed they wanted to work together to stop a No Deal Brexit, but poured cold water on his demands to be installed in NoBoris Johnson is brought down.New Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said this morning that he doesnt command support right across the House of Commons, and he has not been much use, frankly, on the issue of Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"brits would rather have a no deal brexit than let jeremy corbyn wreak havoc in no10 poll reveals","story":"Nearly half of voters want to leave the bloc without a withdrawal agreementit means the Labour boss stays away from Downing Street.Forty eight per cent of voters want Corbyn away from No but around a third,  per cent, preferred the option of Corbyn as PM and a second referendum being staged.Meanwhile  per cent of voters were unsure either way, a YouGov poll found.The vote also found that almost a quarter of Remain voters would prefer No Dealit meant no Corbyn in No, while  per cent of Labour voters say the same about their own leader.While  per cent of Leave voters would rather a No Deal Brexitit meant no Corbyn -

And after hearing from experts that there is on-going concern about Tramadol within breast milk, senior coroner Ian Arrow told the family he would be raising his concerns with the hospital to make sure similar tragedies could be avoided in the future. The inquest, held in Plymouth, Devon, on Monday, heard a post mortem found no evidence of trauma or mistreatment but discovered there was a sub-therapeutic amount of Tramadol which the pathologist believed may have come from the breast or bottle feeds. The pathologist noted that the mother had been prescribed Tramadol by the hospital for her chronic back pain and gave a cause of death as unascertained. The mother sobbed at one stage how she was not going to breastfeed her daughter after being prescribed the drug, but claimed the hospital had said it had been okay to do so.    Professor Peter Fleming also attended the inquest to give his expert view as a pediatrician for  years. He highlighted how Tramadol was a relatively new drug and that information on its effects on babies in-utero was still really quite new with some information only being published in the last year. He said withdrawal from it usually occurs within the first  to  hours and that traces remaining were usually quite small, but it raised the question as to whether breast-feeding would have any effect and that at this stage the issue was unresolved. Baby Saposs grandmother, who supported her daughter, asked Surely the hospital should have indicated that  That the danger is the withdrawal rather than... They didnapost mention it.  Prof Fleming replied: I have concerns about the use of Tramadol. Thereaposs no absolute answer on that [question]. He re-emphasised it was a fairly recently used drug for the past ten years, with it only being more widely prescribed in the last three to four years. Regarding Baby Saposs death he said: My best answer is that Tramadol played a role. I canapost distinguish whether itaposs before birth or was complicated by the withdrawal later on. To the court itself he stated: I think we should be very cautious of Tramadol during pregnancy.

Jade Graves, , claims she lost so much blood that she needed a transfusion as she recovered in a hospital in Bulgaria. The mum said she felt an intense dull pain in her lower pelvic area as she hit the pool at the bottom of the slide and was horried when she saw blood streaming down her legs. She claims she became faint and breathless due to severe blood loss, and spent four days in hospital after undergoing a blood transfusion and surgery to repair the damage. Have you suffered a aposholiday from hellapos  Email webnews@mirror.    Ms Graves, from Hull, is now considering legal action against the Aqua Paradise Water Park in Nessebar, Bulgaria - visited by hundreds of Brits every summer - saying she continues to struggle with signicant psychological trauma. She suffered horric injuries when she went down the Space Jam slide on July  last year. She claims she followed the leguardaposs safety instructions and crossed her arms and legs.    Ms Graves told : “I still can’t believe what happened to me on that slide. I was meant to be having a lovely holiday with my family but the whole experience has been traumatising. “As I hit the water, I was in a lot of pain and I lost so much blood that I had to get a transfusion.  Ms Graves said a staff member looked after her as she lost a signicant amount of blood, but she became faint and breathless. It was a complete nightmare and I still get deeply upset about it.  “I am still uncertain as to what happened exactly, because I followed all the rules put to me by the leguard.  After being taken to Le Hospital in Burgas by ambulance, she was stitched up, given a blood transfusion and underwent surgery to repair a severed artery, she said. She claims she suffered profound arterial bleeding leading to haemorrhagic shock and secondary anaemia. Her treatment in Bulgaria was covered by her travel insurance.  Ms Graves said she was forced off work for about five weeks while recovering from her injuries back home in the UK. A week-long stay at the resort can cost more than £, per person in peak season. The Brit has hired the law firm of Irwin Mitchell to investigate the incident. She said: I really hope that the investigations can get to the bottom of it as I don’t want anyone  to have to go through what I have.    “I wish I had never set foot in that water park.” Ms Graves has called for more awareness on the potential dangers of water slides. Cheryl Palmer-Hughes and Tejire Akaunu, the expert international serious injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell representing Jade, said in a statement: “This is a deeply concerning case where a young woman has sustained horric injuries during what was meant to be a fun and relaxing time. “Unfortunately we see a lot of these cases at this particular time of year, and Jade’s le has been completely turned upside down with her suffering mentally as well as physically.  "},{"url":null,"title":"gcses tougher o levels challenging","story":"NewsAre GCSEs tougher than O-Levels - challenging maths quiz will let you find outEver wonderedGCSE exams are harder than O-Levels from the s  A tutoring website has come up with a simple way to find outShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  AUG NewsAre GCSEs today harder than O-Levels from  years ago \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEach year thousands of teenagers across the UK prepare to take their GCSEs.However, before there were GCSEs there were equivalent qualications available called O-Levels.

Caroline Barnett, , cooks everything from delicious takeaway favourites to lunch box staples. She never buys ready meals or pre-prepared food from the shops and keeps costs down by planning each weekaposs menu meticulously, making her own bread and cakes. Caroline also does special fakeaway dinners which range from scampi in a basket to homemade fish fingers, chip buttyaposs with homemade bread eaten in the local park which she calls chipnics. Sheaposs able to save thousands of pounds each year through her thrty tricks.    The mum-of-eight lives with her husband John, , and children Ellena, , Joshua, , Daniel, , Finlay, , Henry, , Sophia, eight, Florence, six, and Emilia, two, at the family home in Evesham, Worcestershire. Examples of Carolineaposs meals include sausage and egg McMuffins, Nandoaposs-style chicken and cakes- which she makes entirely from scratch using healthy ingredients. The mum saves time on washing up by giving each one of her eight children their own role in tidying up after dinner. Caroline insists that her tight budget doesnapost limit the range of what she can whip up for her family. She uses her creative touch to let the family enjoy fun meals that theyaposll remember - like homemade fish fingers and jars of special, home prepared sweet treats.    She said: Iaposm a mad planner, I plan everything. My motto is: aposFailing to plan is planning to failapos. You have be military when you have a family this big. Iaposm a sergeant major without the shouting, all the children have a role within the house when it comes to washing up. I cook everything from scratch, everything we eat I make myself, I never buy ready meals. I like to know whataposs in our food, the only way to feed a family is to cook from scratch, we all eat the same thing. When you get into the supermarket you get bombarded with stuff you donapost need. I hate waste, I try not to waste anything. If I get to a Friday and my fridge is virtually bare then Iaposm really pleased because then Iaposve shopped well. Caroline and husband John have to transport their clan around in the family minibus and have a strict morning routine to get everyone to school or college on time. She does the weekly shop on a Saturday morning after she sits down and plans the seven days of meals she and her family will be eating. Her typical weekly shop will consist of enough food for seven days worth of breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  Caroline said: Breakfast is usually toast, cereal and fruit and porridge. Mornings can be a bit crazy getting everyone out on time. Lunchtime is mixed, some take packed lunches to school. My husband does the sandwiches and I usually add some cakes or sweet treats Iaposve made myself, I try to avoid crisps. I donapost buy cheap, supermarket alternatives because I know I can save the money by making my own. I make my own bread, cakes and also make my own pizza. The supermum said instead of going to one supermarket, she shops around and is always on the look out for a bargain. She said: I shop around, I start off at Aldi where I get all my staples from such as tinned food, pasta, rice, passata. Weaposll go to Tesco after that for other bits and Iaposll get branded washing powder. I do my planning on a Saturday morning. I plan what weaposll have for the week and then I get out and go straight to the supermarket. If Iaposve seen something that week that I like the look of or want to get the children to try then weaposll add that. We work about £-£ a week. I know what Iaposm going to cook in my head, itaposs all there and I always try to be one step ahead.  The main event of the day is dinner, which Caroline puts extra special thought into. Suppers can range from an elaborate kebab style chicken shawarma to cowboy pie to classic crowd pleasers like spaghetti bolognese. Caroline said: I try and make memories for the children by doing extra things to try and make each meal special. My idea is that theyaposll look back on their childhood and theyaposll say: aposwow, do you remember when mum made thatapos. My main concern for dinner is to make sure itaposs healthy. We have treats of course, le is dull otherwise. I want people to come together around the table and chat about their day. I cook things that anybody could cook, Iaposm a home cook, Iaposm a mum that enjoys cooking. Iaposve got only a set amount of time to get food on the table, usually  minutes. Nothing takes too long.

Webb was summonsed to Suffolk Magistratesapos Court by the council to face four offences of fly tipping household waste. She was arrested by police and put in a custody cell after she failed to appear and a warrant was issued. Webb was eventually released without being convicted - although she was ordered to pay £ to Ipswich Borough Council.    She was also given a six-month conditional discharge after appearing before magistrates via video link from the police station.

The council said she had breached changes to bin collection system rules earlier this year, when residents without storage space were no longer permitted to deposit black bags on the street. Their prosecutor, Richard Essex, said well-publicised changes saw black bags replaced with orange and clear bags for waste separation. Residents had been advised to contact the council to get stocks of orange bags, where relevant, and start using them from March.

Jack Watkin was illegally driving Jo Stringfellowaposs Range Rover Sport when he collided with a bus near his home in Alderley Edge, Cheshire. The bus driver tried to speak to Watkin about the minor shunt, and although the -year-old was not to blame, he refused to give his details and drove off. It later emerged the self-proclaimed aposrich kid of Instagramapos was not insured to drive the £, car.  At Stockport magistrates court, he admitted failing to stop after an accident and having no insurance. Watkin previously made headlines after claiming to own seven lavish sports cars, including two Mercedez-Benz, a Porsche, Rolls Royce and Bentley - which he apparently kept in a huge garage at his home. He claimed his familyaposs wealth meant they were known as the aposBritish Kardashiansapos. In court, the self-employed photographer was ordered to pay £ in costs and surcharges. His driving licence was also endorsed with six penalty points. The crash occurred on December  last year after Watkin went to buy the rail card at Wilmslow railway station.

In this probation period, should a new driver reach six or more penalty points, they can have their licence immediately revoked. Prosecutor Miss Eileen Rogers: “There was a minor road traffic collision with a red single decker bus. The driver tried to exchange details but Jack argued with the bus driver refusing to exchange details then left.  “Officers did checks and found the car registered to Jo Stringfellow and further checks showed the vehicle had no insurance. Ms Stringfellow denies permitting the vehicle to be driven with no insurance.” Watkinaposs lawyer Jeremy Spencer said in mitigation: “The vehicle is owned by Miss Stringfellow, she and Mr Watkins father are in a relationship and Mr Watkins lives with her at her address. He accepts that he took the vehicle, owned by her, and he drove a short distance, stupidly not making enquiries about insurance. He actually went to the train station to get a railcard.  “The position is where the cars and the buses get together the bus driver accepts he had slight misjudgement with the space available. It was his fault, however the key issue was there was a legal responsibility to exchange details. He was tracked through the DVLA. Watkin previously boasted that his father paid for him to enjoy £, designer shopping sprees and that he frequently flew off to lavish holiday destinations on his private jet. He was also selected to appear on a TV show called The Majors after he began sharing images of his lestyle complete with the hashtags #richkidsofinstagram and #ridiculouslestyle.

Played by Cillian Murphy, the house terrying Tommy calls home has been listed on Rightmove, by order of the Peaky Blinders. The four bedroom mews house will be instantly recognisable to fans of the hit BBC show. The property forms part of a private courtyard attached to the building which serves as Arrow House – Tommy Shelby’s impressive on-screen Warwickshire country pile. The period family home has been at the heart of Peaky Blinders scenes since March , when filming began there for the third series.    Resident James Wardhaugh who has lived at Arley Hall for  years, and is now selling his Northwich home for £,, said: They do a lot of filming here at night, it’s quite a spectacle. They shoot scenes right outside my living room window and sometimes I’m just a matter of yards away from the action. They usually film here for about a month at a time and the place is like its own little village. It’s really interesting and they’re happy for us to watch, so long as we don’t interfere. I remember they once had some kind of horse racing scene shot outside so there were loads of horses around in the courtyard.    The retired engineer also revealed whoever buys the stunning home would be able to learn a few behind the scenes secrets. He said: It’s great fun, they have hundreds of extras. The scale is quite amazing, the crowd scenes are really big. It’s riveting to witness. I’m not convinced the filming has added too much value to the house as some people won’t be fans of the show, but for people who are, it’s great. They often film through the night, and you can see the actors practising their lines and waiting for the director to tell them where to go and what to do. The main Arley Hall building is a Grade II-listed property that was built between  and .    It was originally home to the Ashbrook family for more than  years. The property was first used in series three of Peaky Blinders, in which patriarch Tommy Shelby finds himself at the centre of international gang warfare in s Britain, putting his entire organisation and family at risk. Arley Hall’s library became Tommy’s study, while the gallery – typically where wedding parties usually enjoy their breakfast – doubled as the Shelbys’ dining hall. Before filming began the crew brought in bespoke portraits, s furniture and painted the hall dark green to suit Tommy’s tastes but it’s since been ed to how it was before the Shelbys’ tenancy. The grandiose mansion is said to feature prominently in the forthcoming fth series of Peaky Blinders.    James Wardhaugh’s property came to be when, in , the estate re-established the Arley Hall courtyard by linking four new houses to the original properties, one of which is West Gables – the Grade II-listed former Estate laundry. Rightmove’s property expert Miles Shipside said: “It’s fantastic that Rightmove is able to showcase this property and share a link with such a popular show.

The warmest August bank holiday Monday on record was in , when a temperature of .C was recorded, although bookmakers Betway think that next week could be hotter. However, forecasters at netweather.tv are more cautious and have predicted highs of C in London on Monday, just below the record. A spokesman for the website predicted warm weather for much of the country over the bank holiday weekend.     They said: There are signs that parts of the UK could see some fine, warm and sunny weather. This looks more likely for England and inland Wales, but the far north-west of England joins Northern Ireland and Scotland with a higher risk of rain, more cloud and temperatures remaining in the high teens  low s. For the rest of England and Wales temperatures could reach into the mid to high twenties.  However, there is still a lot of uncertainty with the weekend forecast.

Janet Graham, , said she was unaware the barber shop where she worked had a unorm code before she got the dermal piercing done. But her boss at Peverell Barbers in Plymouth - where she was working on a trial basis - was unimpressed. Janet, who lives in Pennycross, told Plymouth Live sheaposs angry but more disappointed, as she already had a nose piercing, several ear piercings and tattoos from day one. The barber, who is originally from Scotland but has lived in the city for  years, said sheaposs now been put off the trade altogether.    But owner of the barber shop, Lauren Boroczky, said Janet was given the option to remove the stud or replace it with a smaller one in order to keep on working there. Lauren, who recently took on the business from her father, added Peverell Barbers is a traditional establishment and she carried on the policy from her dad. My dad ran through the dress code policy with her on her very first day, she said. You have to look smart and presentable with no facial piercings or tattoos. Janet, who is now searching for a new job, says her piercings and tattoos are part of her personality and shouldnapost dictate her job - claiming she never knew they were against the rules. She said: Over  weeks of working there the only thing they ever addressed me with was my clothing, telling me not to wear certain things, which I had no problem with.    But since Iaposve started Iaposve always had a nose piercing, as well as a back tattoo, a tattoo on each ankle and a tattoo on my wrist. I feel the strict dress code changed from being smart and presentable, to suddenly being no facial piercings or tattoos. Janet says she got the piercing last Wednesday after saving up her wages and then sent a picture of it to her boss, asking what she thought. But it was at this point the problems started, and the following day Janet said she was forced to walk out. Janet claims she was told to either remove the stud altogether or get a smaller one - something she was not willing to do because of the expense of the piercing and the pain and potential scarring it could cause taking it out early. She said: I had to walk out as I was so upset and felt pressured about it.

The paedophile financier admitted to soliciting a minor for sex as part of a plea deal that saw him sentenced to a -month stretch in a Florida jail. Epsteinaposs deal with prosecutors has come under intense scrutiny for its perceived leniency in recent months. And investigative reporting by the Miami Herald has shown that the millionaire was not just given a short sentence - he was allowed special privileges and referred to as a aposclientapos.    Documents from the Palm Beach County Sherfaposs Office show that Epstein purchased two pairs of small womenaposs underwear at the prison despite the face he was serving a sentence for a sex offence with a minor. He also bought more than  single-serve cups of coffee in just over a year and used nearly two tubes of toothpaste every month. He had an anti-aging book aposFace Exercises That Prevent Premature Agingapos confiscated from him.    In an email on the day he was admitted to the jail, one official said Epstein’s cell door could remain unlocked, and that he was allowed “liberal access” to a television. Records referred to him not as an inmate, but as a “client.” And his work release schedule was seven days a week where he was allowed to spend up to  hours a day outside the jail, including time at home.    Bradley Edwards, an attorney for some of the women who have accused Epstein of sex offenses, previously alleged that the work release schedule allowed Epstein to have sexual encounters with at least one female visitor. A log of who visited him was destroyed. Epsteinaposs plea deal more than  years ago is the subject of an investigation with reports that Epsteinaposs victims were not informed before it was agreed in a violation of Florida law.Epstein killed himself less than two weeks ago while in a New York jail awaiting trial for further sex offences against children. His death is the subject of several investigations in the United States.

But now, the potentially deadly disease has ed as fewer children are being vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is offered from free on the NHS and protects against measles, mumps and rubella. Two doses of the jab mean  percent of people are protected against one of the worldaposs most contagious diseases. Two jabs have been offered in the UK since  but a damning report by now disgraced doctor, Andrew Wakefield, has seen take-ups of the vaccine decline.    The majority of the new measles cases are now being found in people who have not been vaccinated. In the first three months of this year alone there have been  cases of measles compared to just  in the whole of . Experts from the World Health Organisation, who have revoked the UKaposs measle-free status because of the sharp rise in the number of cases, say some people may be opting out of the vaccine because they have become complacent to the risk of measles. But another key factor is the publication of Wakefieldaposs research in the late s. In it, he claimed there was a link with the MMR vaccine and autism, which has now been discredited and Wakefield struck off the UKaposs medical register.    And his damning report not only led to a downturn in the number of people having the vaccine in Britain, it also affected take-up rates in the US. The MMR vaccine is a totally safe jab. Wakefield is now a staunch supporter of the anti-vaccination movement and has even directed a film, Vaxxed, which claims to show a US health cover-up. However, the film had to be withdrawn from the Tribecca film festival after founder Robert De Niro would not allow it to be included. Despite this, Wakefield is said to have several powerful supporters, including US President Donald Trump.    But despite the controversy surrounding the disgraced doctor, he is reported to be in a relationship with one of the worldaposs most beautul women - model Elle Macpherson. Dubbed The Body because of her stunning figure and ageless beaut, the pair were snapped buying organic vegetables from a supermarket and kissing as they made their purchases. His relationship with the model came after he and his we, Carmel, along with their children fled to the US at the height of the controversy following the publication of his MMR research. Wakefield is believed to have left the family home early last year and is said to have met Elle shortly aftewards at an awards ceremony.    They have been snapped holding hands together several times since and Wakefield is said to be infatuated with the supermodel, known for her healthy lestyle.Brian Burrowes, the man who edited Wakefieldaposs controversial documentary Vaxxed, told Mail Online : Heaposs obviously a bit infatuated. He did say to me aposBrian, how did this happen aposI laughed and said I really didnapost know how this happened. Iaposm just really happy for him. Elle and Wakefield are also said to have enjoyed several mini-breaks, visiting friends. The model is also reported to be responsible for Wakefieldaposs trimmer figure after introducing him to dferent health foods and switching up his wardrobe. Autism campaigner Polly Tommey said: Elle is such a sweetheart. Sheaposs got him on these shakes now for his lunch and dinner.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

And his Tarbert roots run deeper, he was the head chef in Stonefield Castle in  where he met his we Irene, whose family still live in the village.Together with his son Ryan and Ross Payne from the Anchor Hotel the chefs settled in for an afternoon of cooking the finest seafood for the  seafood lovers who had booked their tables though the festival’s Facebook page.No one was left hungry as food started to arrive on tables and by the end of the afternoon there nothing left to cook and the chefs could have a welcome break.While the sunshine certainly added to the enjoyment of this new seafood experience Mike was delighted with the lunch service, saying: ‘It’s been a fantastic day, everyone enjoyed themselves and most of all we’ve raised over £ for the festival. We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special. While McAndrew has the harmonic range, Smalls almost monotoned meanderings, accompanied by the backing vocals of Grant Pringle and Cameron Jack, creates the rawest of emotions.Concluding the new EP is the orchestral art-song, A Theory of Everything.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

number of reasons for his demand for the EU to ditch the backstop in a letter to European Council president Donald Tusk.One of them was the assertion that it would undermine the Good FridayAgreement

peace process, claiming it will be damaged by the backstop, she said.ldquoIn reality it is Boris Johnsonrsquos reckless pursuit of a no-deal Brexit that is threatening to undermine the peace process.ldquoBrexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement and the Tories have shown a total and callous disregard to that agreement and to the democratically expressed wishes of the people of the north.ldquoThe fact is that the British Government has agreed to the backstop and Boris Johnson has voted for it himself.ldquoThe EU have made it clear that the backstop is integral to the Withdrawal Agreement and it is necessary to avoid any hardening of the border. It is high time the Tories realised that too.--vw,vw,px, px\"Arlene Foster said the backstop was not supported by political unionism in Northern Ireland --The backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal treaty which will ensure, come what may in future trade talks, that the Irish border will remain free-flowing post-Brexit.It would see the UK, as a whole, enter into a customs union with the EU for an indefinite period and also see Northern Ireland adhere to EU single market rules on goods.While business and agriculture bodies have been vocal in their support for the backstop, unionist politicians have been vocerous in their opposition, claiming it could undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating economic borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the focus should be achieving a deal that was acceptable to both political traditions in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat is what we should be focusing on and that is certainly what I am focusing on ndash to try to make sure we get a deal that is acceptable to the whole of the United Kingdom and that the backstop is dealt with, she told BBC Radio Ulster.Singling out Taoiseach Leo Varadkarrsquos insistence that the backstop must be maintained, she added: ldquoI am not surprised by the Taoiseachrsquos reaction.

witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected. It is an issue which touches every community.The club, which is run by Fundamental Foods, began in Prestonpans after local headteacher Sheila Laing highlighted the struggle some families faced and has extended to a second base in Tranent.In Prestonpans, they moved the club into Preston Tower Primary School this year from the Pennypit Pagoda because they needed more space.In Tranent, it operates at Sandersonrsquos Wynd Primary School.Both the Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership and Farsquoside Area Partnership help fund the holiday club with money given to them by East Lothian Council as part of their food poverty strategy.The local authority set up a short-le working group to look at how to tackle food poverty following the establishment of East Lothian Poverty Commission in .The group looked specically at ways to help children and young people who need support for ldquoholiday and every day hunger.One of their key actions is to support and develop breakfast, after school and summer lunch clubs in schools.As well as providing daily activities and healthy meals for youngsters, the club in Prestonpans and Tranent has a pantry stocked with food and available for everyone to help themselves to items they need as they enter and leave the club.Local branches of Tesco, Aldi and the Co-op regularly supply the club with leftover food and  staff and volunteers run the club, at both its centres, including an additional support needs specialist.Ruth Davie, from Fundamental Foods which is part of the Prestonpans-based Pennypit Trust, said children come from all over the Preston Seton Gosford and neighbouring Farsquoside wards to the club. Most are referred.She said local knowledge allows them to identy families who need extra help through the community.Ruth said: ldquoIt is really important children can access healthy food and can be dficult for parents during school holidays.ldquoWe have a number of families with a lot of children and provide a service for children aged three to . Some of the older children come back and volunteer as well.As well as food, the club provides free toiletries and took the youngsters on trips over the holidays to places such as East Links Family Park, Dunbar.And free haircuts were provided by Cockenzie-based Unique salon.This week the club has been replaced with a unorm swap shop as school s next week."},{"url":null,"title":"archerfield-cup-grabs-musselburgh-racecourse","story":"Locals and visitors to East Lothian can enjoy seven action-packed races featuring prize money of more than pound, and a host of free family entertainment.Attractions for those with young children includes free funfair rides and face painting.

Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition.

And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

Unlike the diseases of the pasts, such as tuberculosis, which could be cured with antibiotics, or the scourge of cigarettes which has been signicantly reduced by measures ranging from hefty taxation to the smoking ban, obesity and the damage it causes will be much harder to reverse.So far, no country in the world has achieved a signicant or sustained reduction in its obesity rates. At best, there is some evidence that the growth may be slowing down.: Health campaigners call on Sturgeon to make junk food laws a priorityAccording to research presented at the  European Congress on Obesity in Vienna, the percentage of adults in Scotland who are classied as morbidly obese will barely change between  and  with a projected increase from four to five per cent.In comparison, the proportion of massively overweight adults in Wales is expected to almost quadruple - from % to % - and nearly triple in England, from .% to %.Dr Laura Webber, a co-author of the study and a member of the UK Health Forum, put the outlook for Scotland down to \"stronger policy drives\" north of the border to combat weight gain.In total, % of Scottish adults measured in  were overweight or obese - include morbid obesity.

Figures obtained by the Herald earlier this year showed that the number of bariatric surgeries carried out on NHS Scotland has fallen by a fth - from  in   to  in  .The question is whether changing the food environment can offer an effective alternative.One criticism is that restricting price promotions will disproportionately affect the poorest. It is impossible to separate obesity from deprivation.One in three adults living in Scotlands most deprived communities is obese, compared to one in five in the most affluent postcodes.In its submission to the Scottish Governments consultation, BMA Scotland said: \"Increasing food prices have in some cases led to people choosing cheaper food products that are often less healthy.\"Finding ways to ensure that healthy options are also more affordable than unhealthy alternatives can help to change peoplersquos behaviours.\": Warning over back-to-school spike in asthma attacksOf course, pleasure as well as price influences shoppers and, with the best will in the world, making a six-pack of apples cheaper than a six-pack of chocolate biscuits is unlikely to make the fruit bag more appealing to someone seeking a quick endorphin hit.Nonetheless, there is evidence that a price-based approach can work.Professor Peter Morgan, of Aberdeen Universitys Rowett Institute, pointed to studies showing that subsidising healthy foods can change behaviour.He said: \"These demonstrate that both subsidiesand taxationsignicantly alter dietary consumption of targeted food items and contribute to weight control through restricting calorie intake.\"This work confirms other research which suggests that price reduction policy to reduce the cost of healthy foods is more effective on food choice than price increases .\"He said foods high in sugar and saturated fat should be automatically excluded price promotions.The push to change the food environment through legislation is also a signicant pivot away from the narrative of personal responsibility that has dominated the obesity debate for decades.It is no coincidence that major food and drinks brands from Cadbury to Coca Cola have rushed to sponsor major sporting events.Professor Mike Lean, an expert in human nutrition at Glasgow University, said it was vital that any obesity strategy makes clear that exercise is for health not weight loss.\"It is most important to state clearly that physical activity does not contribute usefully to weight loss, to help people already obese.

As an independence supporter, Irsquom growing steadily sick, and increasingly tired, of the antics of some on my own side.It seems that every other day now, alienating behaviour from what should be the fringes of the Yes movement becomes the focus of attention, playing into the hands of opponents of independence.Itrsquos especially frustrating at a time like this, when a hard-right government in Westminster led by Boris Johnson is a gt for those who support independence. Yet, instead of wooing soft Unionists with a smile and a handshake, the Yes movement is seen by some as flag-wrapped, shouting and snarling. It makes no sense.:Could Nicola Sturgeon push the nuclear button to get a second referendum Increasingly, friends of mine who are No voters say they are coming round to the idea of independence. Theyrsquove no emotional attachment to independence but the madness unfolding at Westminster means they could envisage themselves one day voting for separation. However ndash and itrsquos a huge however ndash they all say theyrsquore not quite there yet, and the issue that puts them off independence the most is the aggression and bullying they associate with the Yes movement.When you tell them that online Unionist trolls are just as bad, they simply donrsquot believe you. The experience of Yes supporters may be one of Unionist abuse and bullying, butyoursquore a Unionist your experience will be one of bullying and abuse from nationalists. Thatrsquos how social media bubbles work.The bottom line is that soft No voters, who hold the balance of power in any future referendum, are being deterred from shting their position because of the nastiness of a vocal minority in the Yes movement.Recently, therersquos been a spate of ridiculous and alienating behaviour from some quarters. Jackie Kay, the Makar or national poet, said Scotlandrsquos attitude to race was decades behind England. Kay has a Nigerian father and a Scottish mother. However, with depressing predictability, comments by a woman of colour were written off by white people who wonrsquot accept any criticism of Scotland.These are the people who see reporting facts as ldquorunning down Scotland. Drug deaths go up. Itrsquos running down Scotland. Trains could be better. Itrsquos running down Scotland.

It gets outraged that Union Jacks are on supermarket packaging not Saltires. If they werenrsquot doing such damage to the Yes movement it would be comic.These people are so chippy and thin-skinned, so easily offended, that they are the embodiment of a new type of ldquoScottish cringe ndash their sense of self and their belief in their own country is so fragile anything can threaten it.:Elections watchdog may delay second Scottish independence referendumA few days ago Nicola Sturgeon had to come to the defence of Janice Forsyth when the online Yes fringe turned its ire on the BBC broadcaster. Forsyth tweeted the literary festival Bloody Scotland a joke about Jimmy Krankie. Some independence supporters assumed it was an insult directed at the First Minister. It wasnrsquot.Forsyth was insulted and attacked, as was the BBC. The FM had to put a message out asking people to please leave Forsyth alone.The pro-independence website Wings Over Scotland has floated setting up its own political party. It seems that a signicant minority of Yes supporters see this as a good thing. On social media, the site is known for trolling, abuse and insults.Therersquos a deep confusion and hypocrisy here. The people who support the idea of this new political entity have a long history of viciously attacking anyone who suggested voting for any Yes-supporting party, other than the SNP, at previous Scottish elections. A Green vote was heresy. ldquoBoth votes SNP was their line. Now therersquos a populist alternative in the offing, a form of Scottish nationalism which suits their aggressive tastes, the mantra of ldquoboth votes SNP doesnrsquot matter anymore.The idea that a populist form of nationalism in Scotland will woo much-needed No voters is absurd. The rise of populist nationalism in Scotland will set back every advance so far made.And this takes us to the crux of the problem ndash we now have two competing visions of independence. One comes in the form of politicians like Ms Sturgeon and Patrick Harvie of the Greens. Itrsquos considered, pragmatic, non-threatening it wants to woo opponents. It wants a progressive, fair and equal Scotland, and believes the way to improve the lot of ordinary people is to leave behind the broken Westminster system. The other is Trumpian in nature and thrives on offence rather than persuasion. It wants independence at any cost.To some extent, you could say of the SNP, ldquohell mend them. For years now, the party has allowed this populist fringe to offend and bully. Now the populist fringe is coming for its seats.:Thousands march in support of Scottish independence in Aberdeen with All Under One BannerThe one abiding image of the Yes movement over the last year has been independence marches through towns and cities. The organisation behind the rallies, All Under One Banner, was caught up in internal feuding this summer, which also didnrsquot help the public image of the Yes movement. But more importantly, the marching doesnrsquot help garner new voters. Will waving a Saltire ever persuade a single Unionist to back Scottish independence Genies donrsquot go back into bottles. The only way for the broader Yes movement to protect itself from this growing online wing is to speak up. If people donrsquot speak up then the metastasising populist fringe risks alienating voters who can be wooed and drowning out the voices of the good, decent, majority of independence supporters.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-chocs-away-shop-talk-stakes","story":"SADLY, with chains such as Tesco taking over the corner shop and the introduction of self-service tills, you dont get so many interactions like this, but as a traveller from Aberdeen commented: \"I was in Motherwell, about to get the bus back to Aberdeen.

Now that claim is seemingly dead in the water, the Tories have hit on a new way to boost an economy they seem hell-bent on ruining: raise the state pension age to  and, thanks to the combination of more workers and fewer pensioners, the state will stand to benefit to the tune of poundbn.According to the Centre for Social Justice - a right-wing think-tank chaired by benefits-slasher and one-time Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith - existing policies that will see the state pension age rise from  to  in  and then again to  by  should not only be speeded up, they should be turbo-charged too. Indeed, with the proportion of the population reaching pension age growing far faster than the proportion reaching working - and hence tax-paying - age, the organisation has mooted raising the state pension age to  by  before ramping it up to  just seven years later.At face value it almost seems like a reasonable plan. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, it was only ever meant to act as an insurance policy to be cashed in by those unlucky enough to make it into an infirm old age. With just a quarter of the population living long enough to receive it, the cost of providing that version of the pension was relatively small.Due to dramatic increases in le expectancy in the intervening years, though, state pension provision has become a hugely costly business, with the near poundbn the Government pays out to pensioners now expected to balloon to closer to poundbn in little over a decade.As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, with the taxes paid by todayrsquos workers funding the pensions paid to todayrsquos pensioners, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense raising the pension age is the most obvious way to ameliorate the impact. After all, anything that can reduce the burden on taxpayers while also increasing the pool of workers paying into the system has got to be a good idea, right Well, yes, only there are three glaring problems that show why the plan in its current form should never have seen the light of day. The most obvious issue with forcing swt and dramatic changes to retirement plans is that great swathes of the population are finding it hard enough to work beyond  as it is, never mind keeping on going to  and beyond. Sure, many people are more than capable of continuing to work beyond the official retirement age of , and many do so out of choice. But for those who have spent  years scrubbing floors or laying bricks, fighting fires or digging roads working into later le may not be an option.The state already makes allowances for those in the former group, giving all workers the option to defer taking their state pension infor enhanced payments when they do decide to draw it. Those in the latter group have no such luxury, though, with no systems in place to enable those who cannot keep working to take their pension early at a suitably reduced rate. The implication for them is clear:the pension age is raised further many people will face the stark option of either continuing in a physically demanding job they are physically unfit to do or potentially falling into poverty.The risk of the latter is all too real, with a study from Professor Bernhard Ebbinghaus of the University of Oxford finding that the proportion of over-s living in severe poverty in the UK is already five times what it was in , with our state pension provision largely to blame.The UK is, Professor Ebbinghaus said, ldquoa good example of the Beveridge-lite systems that have historically failed to combat old-age poverty because they ldquohave rather ungenerous basic pensions with means-tested supplements which ldquoreproduce relatively high severe poverty rates among the elderly. Low though the state pension may be, putting it further out of that age-grouprsquos reach is hardly likely to help solve the problem.Then therersquos the question of le expectancy. While it is true that part of the dficulty in accounting for the state pension is that people now typically live for  years or more in retirement, in some parts of the country - and Scotland in particular - that is not the case. And while Scottish males being born today are expected to make it to  and females to , there is no expectation that anyone born between  and  - the first cohort that would be impacted by the mooted pension-age rises - will make it to .That is the crux of why the proposal cannot be allowed to fly. Yes, itrsquos a fallacy that each of us has a pension pot sitting at Westminster with our name on it - and, no, none of us has a right to be supported in retirement by the state - but it would be a cynical government indeed that would expect its citizens to pay the pensions of older generations without any hope of ever getting one of their own. It would be an egregious breach of the social contract and no exaggeration.The Centre for Social Justice has its own spin on the age-rise proposal, with its chief executive Andy Cook saying that by finding ways to help older people stay in work the Government would be doing its bit to improve their health and wellbeing. But as those who want to do that already have the means of doing so, the proposal smacks more of finding ways for a Government staring financial ruin in the face to cut its own costbase.Sure the state pension is expensive, and sure it makes sense to find ways of limiting the extent to which that cost will grow. But doing that in isolation, without also finding ways of growing the pot used to meet that cost, makes no sense at all.Then again, with immigration, that becircte noire of any self-respecting Brexiteer, being the most effective way of increasing the working-age, tax-paying population, is it any wonder the Centre for Social Justice has had to be so extreme "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-need-true-unity-not-vanity-project","story":"Given that we are in a national emergency where normal arrangements do not hold, it is not sufficient to argue, as Mr Corbyn does, that he, on the basis of ldquothe normal constitutional processes, should be interim PM. If he is honest with himself about how he is widely perceived, then he must accept,he genuinely has the nationrsquos interests at heart, that he is not the right person to lead this cross-party coalition.In any case it is desirable that the leader of a government of national unity should not be the leader of any of the main parties, all of whom have particular axes to grind, but should instead be an experienced back-bench parliamentarian who can be impartial, and who has earned and can command the widest possible trust and support in the house. Suggested names of suitable candidates include Kenneth Clarke, Harriet Harman, or Yvette Cooper.If Jeremy Corbyn, in this moment of national crisis, proves to be concerned only with putting personal vanity and party interests first at the expense of sincerely getting this laudable initiative to work, he, and unfortunately his party, will not be forgiven.Robert Bell, Cambuslang.JO Swinson was right to reject the idea of a caretaker government of national unity headed by Jeremy Corbyn. While MPs who oppose a disastrous No Deal Brexit must work together to find a solution, it must be a workable solution, not a fantasy. And a Corbyn-led government is not deliverable ndash it is doubtfulhe could even count on the support of all Labour MPs.The caretaker government option must be pursued, but it must one be headed by a Prime Minister who both commands a majority in the House of Commons and has credibility with EU leaders. The EU must be able to have confidence that the Prime Minister genuinely plans to offer a further referendum, preferably on a deal less damaging to the UK and the EU than that negotiated by Mrs Mayrsquos government. As Mr Corbyn has been all over the place on Brexit, and is still lacking a clear position, he has no credibility whatsoever.The SNPrsquos support for the Corbyn option just delays the dficult work needed to get a credible solution.

He shows no such concern for the will of the  per cent of Scottish voters who in  chose to remain within the EU.After the failure of the independence referendum, the Scottish Government acted with commendable realism and maturity, accepting that the independence cause would have to be relegated to the back burner for the immediate future. It would perhaps still be there, had it not been for the lunacy of Brexit: a move of which the results could never have been anything but bad, and thanks to the well-nigh unbelievable irresponsibility and incompetence with which the process has been conducted are all set to be catastrophic, for the entire UK and most of all for Scotland. If this is not a ldquomaterial change of sufficient magnitude to warrant a re-opening of the independence issue, I canrsquot imagine what would be particularly since a key argument of the No campaign in  was that by remaining in the Union Scotland would safeguard its place in the EU.Mr Thomson imagines that it is ldquodebatable whether Boris Johnson will succeed in re-negotiating a withdrawal agreement.

As co-founder of the CSJ and architect of the much-derided Universal Credit system, Mr Duncan-Smith regards himself as the Godfather of a Conservative Government that appears eager to gradually dismantle the foundations of our welfare state and wishes to see state intervention being limited to th century standards.As Labour MP Paul Sweeney noted, le expectancy in the UK is now in decline at the same time as the CSJ proposes to increase the pension age.

Take the box indoors away from flies.If the hedgehog isn’t bleeding, offering a warm wrapped hot water bottle is good first aid, but do make sure there is room for it to get offit gets too warm and ensure the bottle is not allowed to go cold.Offer some meaty cat or dog food and water but don’t force feed it.Once you’ve done that, call a local hedgehog rescue centreyou know of one, or BHPS on    for further advice and local contacts.If it’s a baby, Fay says you should check for siblings.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances that led up to the incident\"  Appeal for information following suspicious fire in Peterhead viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"“Hoglets don’t usually come in ones,” she said. “If a hoglet it is trouble, its brothers and sisters may well need help too, so do look around vicinity for others.” She added: “Acting quickly could literally mean the dference between le and death.

There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Orkney already generates more than enough renewable energy to meet the needs of our community. The islands are taking a world leading role as a hub for renewables and hydrogen innovation – and for an ever expanding range of research, development and community-led projects.“But we cannot do this alone and continuing support from government will be crucialwe are to overcome the challenges and so make the most of the opportunities for Orkney to take a lead in achieving our shared carbon-neutral ambitions.”He added: “This was a key focus for what were very positive discussions.”During her time in Orkney, Councillor Stockan accompanied the cabinet secretary on a visit to the Kirkwall Harbour Flood Defence Scheme, a £. million project backed by  per cent funding from the Scottish Government.There was also a visit to the project to supply locally produced #green# electrical power to the MV Hamnavoe while docked in Stromness – substantially reducing the ferry’s carbon emissions.In addition, the cabinet secretary saw the work of Kirkwall-based Restart Orkney, a social enterprise which sells good quality second hand furniture and other household items at affordable prices.The venture helps protect the environment, as many of the items would otherwise have ended up being incinerated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

I have been to nine of these COPs, including the worst failures in  and  and the most successful in  and . They are exciting, inspiring, infuriating and often baffling.The  conference in the Hague finished with the chair, Dutch Environment Minister Jan Pronk, in tears because the carefully negotiated agreement he thought he was going to get unanimous agreement on from over  countries and parties was rejected at the last minute by Russia.This was after the United States had done their very best to slow down, block and frustrate every possible process over the two weeks of discussions.We came back in the summer of  for a second go at the agreement.When the final deal was done, there was a very fine moment when the top representative from the United States, a mere Fisheries Under Secretary, was booed by usually serious and diplomatic representatives of UN member countries for saying the US had acted in good faith throughout the process.In  in Copenhagen expectations were high that there would be a new global deal done to tackle climate change.World leaders turned up in the second week of the conference to find that nothing useful had been agreed in the first week.At one point Barack Obama and other world leaders were huddled in a room sitting around Russia’s President Medvedev as he typed out the weak Copenhagen Accord on his laptop, so they could all go home saying they had done something useful. In  the Paris Agreement was negotiated, committing countriesto keep the global temperature rise well below ºC and make efforts towards keeping it below .ºC.Despite many weaknesses the Paris Agreement has been a surprisingly effective spur to both governments and business.COP will see around , delegates spending two weeks in and around the SEC in Glasgow, and many more will march, rally, protest and take part in alternative events in the city. Around  prime ministers and presidents will attend. The world’s nations will report how they are doing on the goals in the Paris Agreement .At Friends of the Earth will be hosting experts and agitators from the FoE international network, just as we have been hosted by them when they have had a COP in their country.We will also be working with other environment, development and protest groups to make sure that the voice of civil society is heard loud and clear inside and outside the SEC.COP will bring increased scrutiny on the actions of the Scottish Government in tackling the Climate Emergency.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed the 20 ni sights on lonely planet s ultimate uk travel guide","story":"The Giant#s Causeway has been ranked as the UK#s third best tourist destination by respected travel guide Lonely Planet, finishing ahead of attractions such as Hadrian#s Wall and London#s Tate Modern art gallery.For the first time Lonely Planet has picked its  most unmissable experiences and hidden gems across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands to form its ultimate UK travel hitlist.Titanic Belfast was also ranked in the top  UK destinations by Lonely PlanetIn total,  sights and experiences in Northern Ireland feature in the list which was unveiled today, including the Crown Liquor Saloon in Belfast, Rathlin Island and Londonderry’s walls.Out of the score of attractions only one is in Co Armagh , while none of the sights in Co Tyrone feature in the Lonely Planet must see list.Welcoming the news, Niall Gibbons, CEO of Tourism Ireland, said: “The inclusion of  Northern Ireland experiences and attractions – including the Giant’s Causeway at number three – in Lonely Planet’s ‘Ultimate UK Travelist’ is good news and will surely help to inspire GB travellers to put Northern Ireland on their holiday wish-list. “It is another well-deserved accolade for all of these attractions, which provides Tourism Ireland with a great hook to continue to promote Northern Ireland as a ‘must visit’ destination.”Lonely Planet’s VP of Experience, Tom Hall, said: “Lonely Planet’s Ultimate United Kingdom Travelist brings together the UK’s most compelling sights and experiences, ranging from world-class museums and giant cathedrals to rollicking festivals, inky lochs and tiny pubs. “We’re thrilled to name the Giant’s Causeway one of the UK’s very best sights - alongside many other wonderful experiences in Northern Ireland including spotting puffins and seals on Rathlin Island and riding a boat through Co Fermanagh’s Marble Arch Caves.”Giant’s Causeway is described by Lonely Planet as “timeless” and “unrepeatable” and is beaten only by the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and London’s British Museum.The Ultimate UK Travelist is available at a cost of £..

speaks on his","story":"THE mother of -year-old Gerald McAuley who was shot dead by a loyalist gunman in August  says she has never felt any hatred towards the man who took her son’s le. While helping families move out of the burned streets of Clonard, Gerald, a member of the Fianna youth, was shot dead by on Waterville Street, not far from his Colinward Street family home. During the Scarman tribunal, an acting superior of Clonard Monastery spoke of how he had given Gerald and three others hit by shotgun blasts the last rites. Gerald was taken to the Royal Victoria Hospital where he was pronounced dead at .pm. The tribunal concluded he had been shot by a Protestant gunman. Speaking to the Andersonstown News Gerald’s -year-old mother Nellie spoke of how her second oldest child was born on the Feast of St Gerard and how much he loved fishing, birds, motor racing and bikes. “I remember when Gerald left school, he went to St Thomas’, he got himself a job in a factory in Northumberland Street. I remember he was working in it around three weeks and he came home and said ‘Mummy, the boss wants to see you.’ The first thing I asked was ‘What have you done ’ I went down and the man praised Gerald, how much of a good, clean worker he was and told me how much he had in common with his own sons. He told me how he wanted Gerald to go to the Tech come September but that Gerald had told him how he wanted to join the Irish Merchant Navy when he came of age. I saidthat’s his wish I can’t hold him back.”Nellie spoke of how on August   she had gone out to look for Gerald as he hadn’t come home.Telling how fraught the roads around Kashmir, Falls and Albert Street had become as violence flared around her and her son Jim as they looked for Gerald. “I remember Gerald came in around am that night and went to bed. I got up the next morning to go to work, I worked in C#A as a cleaner and I turned on the news. It was saying about Patrick Rooney, Trooper McCabe and the fella, the bus driver from Ardoyne who had been killed. I came home later that day and Gerald was in the house with his friend. I said to him ‘Waren’t you in work ’ He said ‘Mummy, there is no work, it’s gone, it’s away.’ He went straight out again and that was the last I saw him.”Nellie said she went out to look for Gerald as trouble continued to flare and found herself at the City Hospital. “I remember the Sister on the ward brought me into the office and I said to her that I was looking for my son. She went out and came back and I will always remember how she said ‘No mother, he’s not here, there’s only a boy of around  in Musgrave.’ I said that’s him, that’s Gerald. “Gerald was a big lad, he had it in the shoulders, he had a big frame and he wore a size  shoe. I remember later a priest being on the other side of the street from our house, he was wearing a heavily beaded vest, a beret and a stick and said ‘Mrs McAuley your son has gone to Heaven,’ then he turned on his heel and walked away.”Following Gerald’s death Nellie recalled her feelings: “You’re here and you’re not here. About six weeks after Gerard was buried we were invited up to the old Felons at the side of the cemetery and that night they had a colour party come on the stage and said that night that Gerard was in the Fianna from  years old. Looking back on it Gerald asked me could he go away for a week with the boys out of school. I remember he said he needed five shillings and could I give it to him. He said he needed an enamel plate, cup, mug and even then the penny didn’t drop. I brought him down to Millets and we got the plate, everything. The fella in the shop said he would need a wee container to carry his eggs in and we got that as well. Soon after he came in to say ‘Mummy I’m awful sorry some of the boys couldn’t get their money and couldn’t go.’ I don’t know how long after that then he did go.”  years on from the anniversary of Gerald’s death on Thursday, Nellie reflected how she “wasn’t ing right” half a century ago.” “I never had any hatred. Gerald died on the Feast of the Assumption, August , that’s Her day, he was taken on Her day and that’s the way I looked at it.” A wreath-laying ceremony for Gerald McAuley will take on Friday, August  at .pm in Bombay Street Memorial Garden.

They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts. She makes paintings, sculptures and installations related to being a woman in st century Britain and, more recently, issues related to the north.Shaunw asked her father to pick someone for a portrait who he believes unites communities here. His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

the response, unionist voters were largely opposed to the prospect of breaking away from the United Kingdom in favour of the EU, with some % of Democratic Unionists and % of Ulster Unionists rejecting the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist

position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in any other way, to be torn away from Great Britain,\" he continued.He said the UK is one of the largest economies in the world.\"We export far more goods to Great Britain than we do to the rest of the world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish

see a hardened border.\"Also responding to the survey, SDLP Brexit spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said his only surprise is that the number of people who favour a border in the Irish Sea over a potential hard Brexit is not higher.\"Brexit has been an absolute calamity which looks about to end in a disastrous no-deal,\" the West Tyrone MLA said.\"This will be bad for business, trade and commerce.\"It will especially hit people hard along the border.\"A united Ireland has become a reality for many now and not just an aspiration.\"It should be no surprise to anyone that a further majority wants to avoid a hard border on this island that would interrupt integrated supply chains, damage our economy and bring hardship to border communities.\"Its sadly also no surprise that the DUP continues to ignore the wishes of most people.\"The Tory-DUP Government at Westminster has no mandate for a no-deal exit.\"The majority of middle ground voters also supported the compromise, with

But Linfield chiefs feel that -they reach the group stages of the Europa League - their team will need an extra day to recover from their Thursday night fixture before playing again.Hence the proposal to move Saturday games to Sundays, despite the long-standing Never On A Sunday rule in its constitution.Mr McGivern said: \"To reach the group stages would be huge for the club and many things need to be taken into consideration.\"We will have extra games - and that will have an impact in terms of scheduling our league matches.\"We cant play home games at Windsor Park on a Sunday because of a club rule. \"Will we have to change that  Probably, but our members will decide that.\"Linfield can play away on a Sunday but there must be a rule change for a home fixture.\"We will be a few games behind other sides and thats the price for being successful in Europe.\"The whole image of the club will be lted and theres obvious financial benefits.\"However, possible change to the clubs constitution has been criticised by North Antrim MLA Mr Allister. \"I think it will be a retrograde step,\" Mr Allister said.\"Theyve had that rule for a very long time. \"To use the exigency of this present situation as an excuse for changing it permanently I think would be inappropriate - and out of keeping with the culture and tradition of Irish League football.\"The ban on Sunday football matches was lted by the Irish Football Association only in , despite protests from the DUP and evangelical campaigners, including the Free Presbyterian Church.The first match held on a Sunday since the ban was lted was an Irish Premiership match between Glentoran and Bangor at The Oval in Belfast.See back page for full story"},{"url":null,"title":"bombay streets burning by loyalists 50 years ago remembered in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is high time the Tories realised that too.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster said the backstop was not supported by political unionism in Northern Ireland The backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal treaty which will ensure, come what may in future trade talks, that the Irish border will remain free-flowing post-Brexit.It would see the UK, as a whole, enter into a customs union with the EU for an indefinite period and also see Northern Ireland adhere to EU single market rules on goods.While business and agriculture bodies have been vocal in their support for the backstop, unionist politicians have been vocerous in their opposition, claiming it could undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating economic borders between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.DUP leader Arlene Foster said the focus should be achieving a deal that was acceptable to both political traditions in Northern Ireland.“That is what we should be focusing on and that is certainly what I am focusing on – to try to make sure we get a deal that is acceptable to the whole of the United Kingdom and that the backstop is dealt with,” she told BBC Radio Ulster.Singling out Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s insistence that the backstop must be maintained, she added: “I am not surprised by the Taoiseach’s reaction. I am almost tempted to say ‘He would say that, wouldn’t he ’.“But I think the letter that the Prime Minister has sent to President Tusk explains very clearly why the backstop cannot be entered into.“Apart from, of course, the simple political reality that it has been rejected three times by the House of Commons, it is anti-democratic, it is inconsistent with the sovereignty of the United Kingdom, and, of course, it risks weakening the delicate balance, as is pointed out in the letter, between the parties to the BelfastAgreement.“I think that’s very important because, of course, the Belfast Agreement has been used to justy the backstop but, as the prime minister points out, it doesn’t have the support of ourselves – political unionism as we are so-called.“I mean, when you look across unionism, we are all against the backstop so that should concern the Dublin Government, becausethe Dublin Government is genuine and values the Belfast Agreement they should be very concerned that unionism does not support the backstop.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry on a recent visit to the Irish border with Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said: “The complete rejection of the backstop by Boris Johnson is reckless and disingenuous.“There is no prospect of the backstop being removed or renegotiated. His scope to move lies around the political declaration and his current stance amounts to the pursuit of a catastrophic no-deal.“Even more concerning is the fundamental misreading and narrowing of nature of the Good Friday Agreement.“The Agreement is about more than the Principle of Consent, it is about preserving the balance of relationships throughout these islands.“The backstop is not anti-democratic, nor it is something imposed from the outside. It is supported by the majority of people in Northern Ireland on a cross-community basis.“By contrast, we welcome today’s re-commitment from Donald Tusk to the integrity of the backstop. It is disappointing the UK Government does not have the same understanding as to what is at stake as the EU.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch northern ireland baby who lived 15 days with rare condition becomes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I make a reference to my go-to sound engineer  Gerry Craig  being a past pupil and so continues a ream of well-known characters in the local and national music scene who are former students of MAPA including  Roe, Ports, Soak, Touts, Balkan Alien Sound, Cherym, Sugarwolf, New Pagans  and  Foreign Owl. Grainne  continues that “once past levels  and  there are pathways for students to continue performing or to get into the technological side of the arts after which students do a HNC or HND which they can then top up to full honours degree at Leeds Beckett, Leeds College of Music or Paisley.

That sounds magic to me. The department maintains links with festivals which offer performance production opportunities including Stendhal and Celtronic. Students also participate annually in BBC introducingas well as ious shows and gigs throughout the year in venues around town culminating in the MAPA showcase which includes live performances of both music and dance as well as recorded pieces. “The space is versatile and state of the art”  Grainne  tells me “the theatre can adapt to accommodate band, theatre and dance performances, there are sound-proofed practice rooms, two recording studios and three computer suites of Mac computers with up-to-date software” which conjures up the image of the perfect environment to satisfy the most creative of minds out there.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters.

My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years. All families bereaved by the conflict are entitled to access to the truth about the deaths of their loved ones.“We need to see the British Government implementing the legacy mechanisms agreed at Stormont House so that families and campaigners can get access to the truth.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshCAPTION: -year-old IRA volunteer Seamus Bradley."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland society dealt decade anniversaries commemorations","story":"This week’s th anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bogside comes in the midst of a decade of anniversaries of many of the seminal events in recent Irish history. Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"strength community shown newtown mayoral visits","story":"Newtown Mayor Cllr David Selby with members of the Men#s Shed\" Strength of community shown in mayoral visitsThe fire cadets in Newtown.\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

He brushed aside two weak challenges in the YC box before firing past Carberry.Within less than a minute it was -.A superb run and cross from Rice was laid off by Neale to the onrushing Thomas Healy and he steered the ball into the corner of Walshrsquos net for his first goal for Killyleagh.Killyleagh were struggling to deal with Olympicrsquos pace in attack, with Molloy in particular causing problems and it took a fine save from Carberry in the th minute to keep out the wingerrsquos curling shot.From the resultant corner Olympicrsquos two big central defenders combined, with Paul Dickson outjumping Macaulay Foster to head back for Jason Noade to head in and make it -.The second half was only four minutes old when Olympic had strong penalty appeals waved away by the referee when McClean went down in the box under a challenge from McConnell.Two goals inside two minutes shortly after the hour mark seemed to have killed the game.Nathan Jones was having his best ever game at The Showgrounds with Killyleagh struggling to cope with his pace when he switched to the left wing in the second half.When he was left one on one with YC sweeper Niall Walsh in the st minute he put on the after burners and delivered a beauty of a finish past Carberry.Ballynahinchrsquos fourth goal, two minutes later, was stunning. A superb team goal passing across the fullof the pitch, orchestrated by Stephen Noade and involving Jones, ended in a YC defender putting into his own net.Killyleagh, though, refused to throw the towel in and when their stand-out player, Rice, yet again exposed a vulnerability on the flanks, his inch-perfect cross was bravely turned in by Neale in the th minute.This was the spark for Killyleaghrsquos best spell of the game with Rice giving width and McConnell the creator and Jamie Sharvin linking up play.Walsh somehow kept out with his feet Jamie Sharvinrsquos nd minute effort from Healyrsquos pass and then three minutes later he gratefully ped on Jamie Sharvinrsquos close range shot under pressure from another Rice cross.The big crowd was getting value for the entrance fee now and Walsh underlined his Amateur League representative reputation by producing a supering save from Ricersquos cross to cut out the danger in the th minute.Olympic were content to hit on the break by this stage and substitute Aaron McClean went close with a header before the visitors delivered the ultimate sucker punch.A stunning pass from deep allowed Jones to race through and Dalton Tate delivered the finish in the nd minute.But still the game wasnrsquot finished. Rice powered down the line yet again and once more producing a teasing cross which Neale thumped in.It was now -. At the opposite end Shane Murray blasted over the bar when he was played through by Jones and then Killyleagh thought they had pulled it back to - to set up a grandstand finish when Nealersquos shot was spilled and Dylan Kelly rled home, but the referee ruled he had been in an offside position when the initial shot was delivered.No one was leaving early and at this rate, there will be plenty looking to book their place for thematch later in the season.By then, Olympic will hope they have further underscored that they are the team best equipped this season to challenge Crumlin Starrsquos stranglehold on the premier title..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sharon stars on Angela’s day  ","story":"LADY luck shone down on Angela Kenmore for her Lady Captainrsquos Day at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club on Saturday.A welcome window in the weather meant that the ladies escaped the dayrsquos frequent deluges and almost miraculously went round rain free.Heavy showers early in the morning had put the competition under threat and the afternoon downpours meant that Mrs Kenmorersquos male guests got a soaking.But not aof rain fell on the ladies, who also had the benefit of not having to play out of the water-logged bunkers.Despite the weather prediction, there was a great turnout and a thrilling finish.Sharon Heaney and Anne Teggart finished tied at the top of the leaderboard with  points, but it was Sharon who took the Lady Captainrsquos prize thanks to a better back nine.With Anne having to settle for the runners-up spot, third place went to Patricia McCormick, who came in with  points.The prize for the best gross went to Caitlin Burke who beat Twyla Gibson on the better back nine after they both ed a score of .The front nine prize went to Mary Rice with  points and Orlagh Carson won the back nine prize with  points.Anne Savage won the past lady captainsrsquo prize with  points and Alison Rooney won the committee prize with  points.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Margaret Willis , Caitlin Burke , Jackie Elliottand Patricia McCormick .Gerry Gray won the lady guestsrsquo prize with  points and Brendan Mullen won the male guestsrsquo prize with  points.The Lady Captainrsquos mixed greensomes competition on Thursday was won by vice-captain Robert McCausland and past lady captain Eileen Mullen with  points mdash one point better than runners-up Ryan Teggart and Carmel Hanvey.Nearest the pin prizes were won by Anne Tumeltyand John Passmore ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Taking porridge and exercise are Roddy’s secrets to long life  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new centenarian, Roderick Maguire, says his secret to a long le is his daily bowl of porridge.The former master painter says he still has porridge every morning which he makes for himself at his Thomas Russell Park home.Mr Maguire, better known as Roddy, turned  nearly two weeks ago on August .He received the customary congratulatory card from the Queen as well as a letter from Irish President Michael DHiggins and euro, mdash a special financial bounty known as the Centenarian award.Mr Maguire was treated to a special reception in St Patrickrsquos Church after parish priest Fr John Murray said a special mass for him on his birthday.His family gathered at Quoile Bistro the next night to have a family reunion, which included children and grandchildren who travelled over from Doncaster in England.With his first we Betty, who sadly died many years ago, he had four children mdash Rory, Joan, Anne and Niall.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise.

The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of .

Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m.
