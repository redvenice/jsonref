The plot of land was unwanted by architects and developers because of its size and shape          The first floor is where the family spends most of their time, in a large open-plan kitchen and living room. It leads out onto one of the two courtyard gardens          The large kitchen is fitted out in a retro style, with pale green kitchen cabinets and a parquet floor. There are two tables that accommodate their large familiesMr Lazarus, an architect, said it took them almost five years to get past red tape after they purchased the plot before they were able to start building work in 2016.It then took another two years before their creation on the 12ft by 216ft plot was finally built, the Evening Standard reports.   Mr Lazurus, who paid £240,00 for the site, said: \u0027One of the challenges was to build something where the spaces felt well-proportioned.\u0027It felt like a lot of money to be handing over. I remember thinking, Oh my God, what have I done?\u0027 The couple also wanted to \u0027give something to the street\u0027 so they made the bricks \u0027shine\u0027 with parts of the front of the property covered in mirror cladding. It makes the house glitter at night under street lights, and people often stop to take photographs.          A brightly lit hallway leads into the sizeable kitchen. The floor to ceiling glass doors maintain the sense of space felt throughout the property          The central staircase from the ground floor of the house. The property was built in two parts with the shell built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000. By the start of last year they had a structure with a roof, windows, a staircase and wallsThe ground floor is overlaid with an anodised aluminium grid which is anti slip safety flooring used in factories.The property was built in two parts. The shell was built first, which took a year and cost just over £300,000. By the start of last year they had a structure with a roof, windows, a staircase and walls.They then spent another £200,000, hiring builders to finish installing the flooring, plastering the walls, plumbing and fitting the three bathrooms and kitchen. Just before Christmas Mr Lazurus and his family were able to move into the house.          In daylight the front of the house looks like a dark and textured tower thanks to the brickwork. It means at night the street lights make it glitter  The unusual design of the building makes it stand out from the rest of the street in Hackney, east London. Mr Lazurus says that at night time people often stop to take pictures as the building twinkles in street lights          The three bedroom property has a large open plan kitchen and living room and a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery system which sucks in fresh air from outdoors. This is a view of one of the living spaces on the first floor          The house makes the most of its space, with built-in desks and shelves in the hallway. All its landings are large allowing them to be used as open-plan rooms. This space leads onto the other courtyard gardenThe ground floor has a coat room, a store room for bikes and camping equipment, the yoga stuidio which could also be a fourth bedroom, and a courtyard garden.The first floor contains the open plan  kitchen and living room, a lushly planted garden terrace,  It has a central staircase, with large landings, and the hallway between the children\u0027s bedrooms means it is big enough to act as a homework room, complete with desks, bookshelves, and a music room and piano.Upstairs the master bedroom has an en suite with twin hand basins, and the hallway has a built in desk, making it an ideal office space.           The hallway between the children\u0027s bedrooms means it is big enough to act as a homework room, complete with desks, bookshelves, and a music room and piano          The central staircase of the four storey house that has been shortlisted in two categories at this year\u0027s Brick AwardsThe ventilation and heat recovery systems sucks in fresh air from outdoors, which uses ambient heat and also keeps the house cool.It has been shortlisted in two categories at this year\u0027s Brick Awards, which \u0027celebrate the best examples of clay brick in the built environment.\u0027 This clever Ori Studio transforms space at touch of a buttonOprah and Gayle King celebrate secret royal wedding in ParisYe, formerly known as Kanye West, delivers pro-Trump speechWillow Palin shares video of wedding reception celebrationsDonald Trump Jr. tells DailyMailTV his MeToo fearFormer Baywatch star avoids questions about his homeless ex-wifeNaomi Campbell in bullish exchange with staffers outside the NYSEFamilies run for their lives as the ground turns to liquidFlake and Coons discuss Kavanaugh FBI investigationBrooke shows off her fishing talent in YouTube clips\u0027Things aren\u0027t what they seem\u0027: Samantha Markle says on Jeremy VineTory activists wait in line to hear Prime Ministers conference speech"},{"url":null,"title":"If Tower Londons raven master loses birds legend Britain turn dust","story":"    Chris Skaife, Master Raven Keeper at the Tower of London, pictured with Merlina the ravenThe reigning champion is Munin, who, at 23, is the oldest and longest-serving of the seven ravens at the Tower.She came here in 1995 when she was only six weeks old and has had three partners. As two of them are now dead, she is affectionately known as the Black Widow and currently has a younger partner, five-year-old Jubilee. All I can do is wish him well.I have something of a troubled relationship with Munin. Sometimes I think she hates me.She has been giving me the run-around for years and, since research suggests that ravens can recognise human faces, I can only assume that I did something horrendous in my early days at the Tower for which she has never forgiven me.Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London...The \u0027Temple of Transportation\u0027 that Jackie Kennedy helped...Share this articleI started working here as a Yeoman Warder, as we Beefeaters are properly known, in 2005.All of us, servicemen and women, have long records of unblemished service — in my case, almost 25 years as an infantryman.That took me all over the world and eventually to the Tower of London, with its bloody history of murder, torture and, of course, ravens.Without them, the legend goes, great harm will befall the kingdom and the Tower itself will crumble into dust.      Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower of London in the 1960sThe man had managed to capture Munin using only a holdall and a blanket — together with a thick pair of gardening gloves and some chicken legs to tempt her.Thanking him for helping us to save the kingdom, we placed Munin in her travel box and made our way back to the Tower, where I reflected on an important lesson. Never underestimate the ravens.I often try to see the Tower through their eyes: the sheer looming mass of the buildings, like cliffs, and the continual hubbub of sound, like the howl of the tundra all those potential playmates and the ever-present threat of predators.We will never know all of what goes on inside their heads but they certainly seem to have the capacity to remember.When Derrick Coyle visited the Tower some seven years after leaving as Ravenmaster, for example, Merlina came straight to him. It was as if he’d never been away. Seven years!Following my time in the Army, caring for the ravens has meant becoming a part of another family — learning to trust and be trusted —and doing what I can to the best of my ability when they need my help.And if you have enjoyed reading about my life with these remarkable creatures, perhaps I can ask a small favour.Years from now, long after our current ravens have gone, and I, too, have passed on to that great raven enclosure in the sky, you may be visiting the Tower. Perhaps there will be a raven there named after me, and this Skaife may be looking at you in that way only ravens can.Don’t get too close — he may bite. But say hello from me.Kn-ck, kn-ck.

Reality TV shows like Love Island are \u0027dangerous\u0027 to children and could undermine #MeToo movementMrs Lunnon says young people might not be able to distinguish between what is real and what is fake.She said: \u0027The problem attached to that is what are the long-term consequences of a world where a) we are celebrating something essentially trivial, and b) we are focused, such relentless focus on appearance and the presentation of brand self - which we know is a spillover from social media itself.\u0027And Love Island\u0027s message, it seems to me, is conform and look beautiful otherwise you are not worthy of being loved.Kim Kardashian is the \u0027most dangerous\u0027 celebrity to search...Share this article \u0027Which is unbelievably dangerous.

Love Island was described as \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture which obsesses over image by Mrs Lunnon\u0027So there is nothing wrong with a bit of light-hearted entertainment at all.\u0027Mrs Lunnon explained that one way to tackle the effect of reality TV and social media would be for schools to remind students they belong to a community.She added that in recent years she had witnessed pupils become increasing engaged in political debate, something she found promising.\u0027It is youthquake rather than snowflake, I think. I think we should stop telling kids that they are insignificant and fragile and vulnerable.\u0027The snowflake thing is not helpful. They could change things, and if we get them to take themselves seriously and take the world seriously, they will,\u0027 said Mrs Lunnon.Veteran broadcaster Michael Buerk, who also spoke at the conference, said the age of social media and reality TV shows had seen public discourse become increasingly shallow.\u0027They are about us looking at ourselves, albeit in the mirror of other people’s lives, not interrogating the outside world.\u0027And they are making us ignorant, stupid and unhappy. And they are phenomenally successful. More fool us.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/12/05C7E012000007D0-0-image-a-15_1538565446946.jpg","title":"The 5 senators decide Brett Kavanaughs fate revealed","story":"    A small group of Senators will likely decide whether Kavanaugh sits on the Supreme CourtSenator Susan Collins – Republican from MaineA moderate Republican, Collins, 65, has long been a swing vote in the U.S. Senate – and the upcoming confirmation vote on Kavanaugh could prove to be one of her most important since joining the Senate in 1997.Though a member of the Republican Party, Collins is pro-choice on the issue of abortion rights and has expressed belief that Kavanaugh would uphold the landmark Roe V. Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in most circumstances in the U.S.Kavanaugh had previously stated that the Roe v. Wade decision was ‘settled law’ in the country.The Maine Senator previously voted to confirm Kavanaugh after he was nominated by former President George W. Bush for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2006.Despite her previous confirmation vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Collins has faced intense pressure to vote against his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. A group of progressive activists has reportedly raised more than $1.75 million (£1.3m) in crowdfunding and vowed to release the funds to her future campaign opponents if she indeed votes in favor of Kavanaugh’s confirmation.Both the campaign funds and confirmation vote could have a key impact on Collins’s future Senate race, as polls reportedly showed that Maine voters were less likely to support Collins if she voted to confirm Kavanaugh – even before the sexual misconduct allegations against him surfaced.Senator Lisa Murkowski – Republican from AlaskaMurkowski, much like Collins, has become known as one of the leading moderate Republicans in the U.S. Senate.The 61-year-old Senator, who has been a member of the legislative chamber since 2002, has been known as an independent voice during her tenure, supporting abortion rights and, alongside Collins, helping to scuttle an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act signed by former President Barack Obama.Murkowski’s self-imposed test on the Kavanaugh confirmation vote comes, not from perilous reelection prospects – she’s not up for reelection until 2022 in a reliably Republican state – but whether women who allege that a sexual assault took place against them should be taken seriously.‘We are now in a place where it’s not about whether or not Judge Kavanaugh is qualified. It is about whether or not a woman who has been a victim at some point in her life is to be believed,’ she said.Murkowski, who soon joined fellow Republican Senator Jeff Flake in calling for an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, does indeed have a political balancing act to do ahead of the confirmation vote.The Senator has long been supported by Native Alaskans, whose backing of her could falter after it was revealed by Hawaii Senator Mazie K. Hirono that Kavanaugh appeared to question whether Native Hawaiians were a legitimate protected group.          Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has a history of crossing party lines in the U.S. SenateSenator Jeff Flake – Republican from ArizonaFlake, 55, has long been a thorn in President Trump’s side. A vocal critic of the President who’s served in the U.S. Senate since 2013 and previously in the U.S. House of Representatives, Flake’s vote is seen as crucial.Unencumbered by political pressure – he’s opted not to run for reelection this year – Flake has expressed support for Kavanaugh’s conservative views but cautioned that the confirmation process needs the support of the whole country, something very difficult in the face of the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh and the polarized political climate that’s gripped the United States in recent years.‘I want to support him. I’m a conservative, he’s a conservative judge. But I want a process we can be proud of, and I think the country needs to be behind it,’ he said.Flake, who said that the testimonies of both Kavanaugh and Ford left him with ‘as much doubt as certainty,’ voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination but was also the first Republican Senator to call for an official FBI investigation to the allegations made against President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee.He’s made his views known that he intends to ultimately vote to confirm Kavanaugh unless the ongoing investigation turns up evidence the nominee lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee or engaged in unlawful sexual conduct.Though he has a long history of bucking Trump’s demands, Flake did indeed vote to confirm the President’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.Senator Heidi Heitkamp – Democrat from North DakotaHeitkamp, 62, has served in the Senate since 2013 and is currently locked in a tight reelection battle in a state won easily by Trump.The North Dakota Senator, who previously voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, appeared to express at least some degree of support for Kavanaugh before the sexual misconduct allegations against him arose, even praising him as ‘highly-qualified’ for the position of Supreme Court Justice.However, the allegations against the nominee may have given Heitkamp pause.At a recent campaign stop in Grand Forks, North Dakota, she said that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be something that’s ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ and also blasted her campaign opponent, U.S. Representative Kevin Cramer, for being critical of Ford’s allegations, denouncing the congressman as someone who has ‘a stunning lack of empathy for victims and the trauma they experience.’She’s also backed the ongoing FBI probe centered on the allegations made against Kavanaugh, saying: ‘We need to get politics out of this process and allow an independent law enforcement agency to do its job’  Heidi Heitkamp, left, is currently locked in a close reelection battle with Kevin Cramer, rightSenator Joe Manchin – Democrat from West VirginiaManchin, a 71-year-old conservative Democrat, is also facing reelection in a state overwhelmingly won by President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.Having first joined the Senate in 2010, Manchin voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 and has sided with Republicans on a number of issues.However, the West Virginia Senator has cited healthcare as a key deciding factor for him when it comes to Kavanaugh’s nomination, as he’s said that he’d like to see U.S. courts preserve the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans suffering with preexisting conditions.So far, Manchin has dropped few hints as to whether he’d vote to confirm Kavanaugh or not, but has stated that the judge had ‘all the right qualities’ after meeting with him earlier in 2018.Manchin has also backed the FBI investigation on the allegations made against Kavanaugh and has indicated he’d base his vote on the judge’s credentials if no evidence was found backing up the accusations made against Kavanaugh.‘If there’s nothing conclusive, then it’ll be based on the merits of him being qualified,’ he said. Mac Miller A Celebration of Life concert: All you need to knowNational Coming Out Day 2018: All you need to knowGerman Reunification Day 2018 is marked with a Google DoodleThis Is Us spoilers: Do Toby and Kate get orced?BFI London Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to know about the 62nd BFI LFFFortnite season 6 searches on Pornhub doubled after launchThe 5 senators who will decide Brett Kavanaugh\u0027s fate revealedEuroMillions results: National lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 2Hocus Pocus 25th Anniversary Halloween Bash: All you need to know about Freeform\u0027s reunion specialColumbus Day 2018: When is it, how is it celebrated and is it a federal holiday?New on Netflix Australia in October 2018: All the new movies and TV shows revealedWorld Mental Health Day 2018: Everything you need to know What\u0027s on HBO in October 2018?

Since July, Tesla has been parking anywhere from a couple of dozen to a few hundred cars at a lot in Burbank, California. It\u0027s a similar story in the town of Lathrop near San Francisco where Tesla has 400 cars at an industrial site according to the New York Times.Hundreds more have been located in in Antioch, northeast of San Fran. Last week, the newspaper reported that another batch of 100 Model 3s cars  in Bellevue, Washington with further batches in Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.Delta aircraft is evacuated after aborting its takeoff at...Who toppled the statue? Mystery in Philadelphia after...Share this article    The company has refused to comment on the reason for the surplus other than to say there were delivery problems at one stage          Some have suggested the full lots are because demand for Teslas isn\u0027t a great as the company advertises          Internet sleuths have taken to sending up drones and even flown in private planes to snap pictures of the parking lots containing dozens of the parked-up TeslasThe vehicles, which have all been parked on private property, have been uncovered by amateur detectives many of whom have flown drones over the parking lots to take pictures of the sitting cars.Another ended up taking to the skies in a private plane to snap hi-res photos from the air before posting them on Twitter. The sleuths are betting that Tesla\u0027s share price will fall and suggest Elon Musk has not been truthful about the company\u0027s current situation, particularly its sales numbers.The existence of such massive lots full of cars are likely proof that something is amiss at the company. A Tesla spokesman, Dave Arnold, said by email to the Times that the large lots of vehicles were \u0027logistics transit hubs\u0027 and added, \u0027Anyone observing those lots will see a change from one day to the next.\u0027           One photographer took to the skies in order to capture the cast numbers of cars sitting idle           Tesla Inc. vehicles sit in a parking lot outside of a newly constructed production tent at the company\u0027s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California           Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year - but then why are so many of the cars going nowhere? Production increases are something Musk worked nearly to exhaustion to achieve. He has publicly said he has been working as much as 120 hours per week and sometimes even slept on Tesla\u0027s factory floor in Fremont, California, to oversee the efforts to make more cars. The company even built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s.But doubts remain whether the company can continue to crank out enough vehicles to achieve profitability, something that still eludes Tesla.Although it successfully reached its production goals for the third quarter, getting those vehicles into the hands of consumers has proven to be a headache.Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year.But one other theory is that the presence of parking lots with hundreds of Teslas all parked up with no place to go, could mean that there is a delivery problem.          At one point, Elon Musk suggested that there was a shortage with hauliers transporting cars  CEO Elon Musk has pledged to work out the manufacturing problems that have raised questions about the electric car maker\u0027s future prospectsCustomers have been complaining that their Tesla delivery dates have been delayed over and over while vehicles sit unmoved in lots. One tweeted to Musk last month: \u0027There are 42 Tesla\u0027s sitting at the Union Pacific Railroad in SLC. My car is one of these. I\u0027ve been told I was getting delivery the 8th, then the 15th, then the 20th, then the 22nd, and now my delivery has been delayed indefinite. @Tesla @elonmusk... Please make this right.\u0027Musk tweeted back and acknowledged the problem: \u0027Sorry, we\u0027ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We\u0027re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.\u0027Musk attributed the problem to a shortage of trucks to haul cars around the country but others disagree saying there is \u0027plenty of car haulage capacity.\u0027  \u0027The Auto Haulers Association of America is not aware of any shortage of car haulers, nor of any other automakers that are having trouble shipping new vehicles,\u0027 said  Guy Young from the organization.Musk has even said that Tesla has developed its own trailers to transport cars to customers but no new designs have been approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates such transporters.          The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Thousands are sitting in lots around the country          Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot featureEither way, it is clear that Tesla appears to have failed to set up an efficient way of delivering the hundreds of cars a day it is producing.The only other alternative is that demand is far less than Tesla is suggesting and the reason there are so many lots full of the costly cars is because there are simply no buyers.     Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance feature.More could be revealed in the coming days when Tesla reports production and delivery data for the last three months.But patience is wearing thin for people who have already put down $1,000 to get on a waiting list for the Model 3.Tesla has never turned an annual profit during its eight-year history and rarely done it on a quarterly basis, but it needs to reverse that trend to erase doubts about its survival.The company has been under mounting pressure to stop burning through cash with $1.3 billion of its more than $10 billion in debt due to be repaid during the next six months.Musk will give up his post as Tesla\u0027s chairman for at least three years after tweeting in August tweet that he would take the company private and had \u0027funding secured\u0027 for the deal.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Thursday that said the tweet constituted securities fraud because Musk knew he hadn\u0027t lined up the money for such a deal.Critics, including some investors, had pushed for similar changes recently, arguing that a new chairman and a board less tied to Musk would be good for Tesla and its investors. Some have argued Musk should even give up the CEO role and assume a post such as chief technical officer.The SEC said it wanted to bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, a scary option for investors who felt Musk was nearly synonymous with Tesla and that another executive would have trouble managing Tesla\u0027s manufacturing challenges and keeping the public satisfied in spite of Tesla\u0027s substantial debts.Unraveling a Tesla Mystery: Lots (and Lots) of Parked Cars - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/18/50EDE65100000578-0-image-m-30_1538501234483.jpg","title":"A day life Gisele Coconut oil sun gazing aromatherapy foot massages kids","story":"    Gisele Bundchen, 38, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has just published new book Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life - which details her daily routine, workout regime, diet and meditation schedule          She and Brady are parents to son Benny, 8, and daughter Vivi, 5, as well as the athlete\u0027s older son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan          Gisele writes her day starts between 5am and 6am, when she rises to \u0027ocean\u0027 sounds on her phone she then spends up to 15 minutes swilling coconut oil in her mouth in a process known as \u0027pulling\u0027     Gisele, a native of Brazil, married Brady in 2009 the model writes: \u0027It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive\u0027          Gisele, pictured in the web television series Tom vs Time, lives outside of Boston with Brady and their family, in addition to enjoying a property in Montana\u0027s exclusive Yellowstone Club - which featured heavily in the program          Gisele says her children perform daily chores, and she emphasizes cleaning she likes to leave \u0027rooms as tidy as I found them\u0027          Gisele writes in the book that she enjoys taking her children to school herself each night, she gives \u0027them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy.

(Gisele and Tom were dating for two months when the supermodel found out his ex, Moynahan, was expecting his child.)          Gisele writes: ‘I drink water all day long, as well as lots of tea.

It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive.‘This is why making a big deal out of little moments matters a lot to me. Stretching my body the moment I wake up. Being conscious of my breath. Lighting a candle. Meditating. Singing with my kids on our way to school.‘More than anything, these moments are about appreciation. My goal is to be present.

To live a full and meaningful life with the awareness of what’s happening around me – and to inspire my children to live that way, too.‘Bedtime is another ritual. When Tom his home, he kisses the kids good night and sometimes he tells them a story. At bedtime, I love reading out loud to each child. Then I do something I ‘ve done since Benny and Vivi were infants: I give them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy. Five minutes of foot rubbing really calms them down, and makes us feel close.‘The last thing I do before saying good night is to remind them to pray to their guardian angel. I often wait outside their rooms, listening to them saying their prayers, and it melts my heart every time.’Tom usually goes to bed by 9pm, she writes, whereas she can stay up as late as 10, though she showers before going to bed ‘especially if they used lots of product and my hair looks crazy.’ (It’s not exactly clear who ‘they’ are.’‘I need at least seven hours of sleep, eight if I can get it,’ she writes. ‘Thankfully I’ve never had any trouble falling asleep. I’m usually exhausted at night, and as soon as I put my head on the pillow, I am gone.’And so ends a typical day in the life of the wife of America’s favorite quarterback, only to begin again in the early-morning hours with another rake of health-consciousness, exercise, mindfulness and even makeup – though of course, as the supermodel emphasizes, it’s not an obligation."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/21/50EFCB2B00000578-0-image-m-9_1538513118635.jpg","title":"First trailer released showing Christian Bales transformation Dick Cheney","story":"From Batman to VP: Christian Bale has transformed himself into Dick Cheney for his latest role in the upcoming film Vice       Jennifer Lawrence is seen vaping on the street in NYC in...Ben Affleck looks as if he\u0027s auditioning for his old Batman...Share this articleThe blink-and-you-missed-it clip briefly shows Cheney with his wife, Lynn, portrayed by his American Hustle co-star Amy Adams, and offers a few glimpses into his career and life, including the infamous 2006 quail hunting accident, in which the hawkish VP inadvertently shot a friend in the face. The movie, which is set to open in theaters on December 25, follows Cheney\u0027s rise to power within the Bush administration between 2001 and 2009.Bale, who is widely known in Hollywood for undergoing dramatic physical transformations for movie roles, has said that in order to embody Cheney, he packed up 40lbs, shaved his head and bleached and plucked his eyebrows daily during shooting.

The left hands reveal their private sides.’Can this be true? We asked Helen to read these royal palms without knowing who they belonged to. The results were uncannily accurate...    The lines on the right hand represent the side the royals want to show the public. The left hands reveal their private sides, palm expert reveals 1. A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION          A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION: Feminine with long, willowy fingersThese hands are very feminine. From the long, willowy fingers, it’s clear these are the hands of a sensitive, artistic person. This is the most interesting royal palm thanks to a very unusual feature on the right hand, known as a Simian Line.Usually the Head Line and Heart Line are separate and spaced apart as they run into the centre of the palm. However, on this royal, it shows up as only one line which ides the hand in half horizontally.This special feature is known as a ‘gift marker’ —and reveals a person of enormous drive, energy and focus. Add this to the long, straight Heart Line on their left hand, it reveals a considerate person likely to be a humanitarian.This person will also need a mission which they can pour their energy into to be happy. This is not a royal who will want to hide behind the scenes, more someone who will take to the world stage and make a positive impact.Also, the equal length of ring and index fingers mean they really understand feelings which will also make them a good parent.2. CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD            CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD: Thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature sideThe thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature side, or perhaps a passion for food. The ruddy colour and bloated appearance of the hands also suggest this is a person who needs to pay more attention to their health. The Life Line is short too, suggesting low energy.The length of the fingers also show this is a royal who loves to talk.The slightly longer ring finger suggests they love a bit of appreciation and applause — if they weren’t a royal they could have been a celebrity food critic!Other markers show this royal may feel conflicted by the expectations of being a member of the Royal Family.For example, the Life Line and Head Line start and stay together for about an inch, so this person is comfortable following the traditions they’ve grown up with. However, this conflicts with the shortish middle finger, which suggests a desire to rebel or break ‘the rules’.That could mean this member of ‘The Firm’ is not sure how to get his needs met and still fit in with the expectations of his position.  3. THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE            THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE: Slightly longer ring fingers emphasis someone who can be quite analyticalThis royal has the fingers and palm of a thinker, someone who can be quite analytical, emphasised by her slightly longer ring fingers.This means she is probably quite visual and her appearance may be quite important. It also means this is someone who thrives on appreciation and applause!This royal holds their little finger off to the side, suggesting a highly private person who prefers not to expose their vulnerabilities.Both thumbs are held close to her palm, suggesting again they like to play their cards close to their chest.All in all, a strong inidual capable of restraint in pursuit of what she believes in.4. FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION          FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION: Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional valuesThe three lines, crossed by three others, at the bottom of this royal’s index finger, shows this is someone with very high standards.Like many royal palms, the Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional values. However, the short distance between the height of this person’s middle fingers and their index and ring fingers, shows they have a rebellious streak. This is likely to have shown up more in their youth.There are also four short parallel lines under the joint between the ring and little fingers. This is ‘the gifted healer’. It can mean someone who is inspirational in helping others.It’s possible this royal will have expressed this through charity work. 5. A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE          A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE: Area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plumpThe area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plump.This shows a person who likes to have fun and may have been a bit of a hedonist in their youth. This royal’s Heart Line is curvy, showing that they are naturally passionate.However, as the line straightens out towards the end, it suggests this person curbs their passionate nature, possibly out of duty.In both hands, the index, or pointer-finger, looks the strongest and has more of a ‘platform’ or fleshy pad. This suggests someone who has put a lot of energy into being in charge, carving out their turf and leading the way in what matters to them.As these qualities also show up on the left hand, this royal will be no walkover at home either — and that will help make them a good parent and partner. 6. CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE          CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE: Middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebelThe middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebel.This person also has a light, horizontal line joining the Head and Heart line. This means it’s hard for them to decide whether to go with their heart or logic. A slightly upward curving Heart Line shows a caring character who tries to do the right thing, even if their inner rebel sometimes gets them into trouble.The way their vertical Fate Line — also known as a Saturn Line — underneath the middle finger stops at the Head Line shows this side probably kicks in when they get bored.The little finger is long, suggesting this is a person who probably loves to talk.The ring at the base of their little finger, covering the bottom segment — the intimacy zone — also shows this person wants to protect themselves from being hurt emotionally.7. A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE          A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE: A square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done’ This royal has a square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done.’His Head Line is the straightest and least curved of them all, revealing this is the most logical person in the family.There is also a Fate Line which goes up vertically through his palm towards his middle finger.This shows someone who is a doer who follows through.This royal’s Head Line is long and straight and stretches into his zone of intuition — the plumper area down the side of your palm opposite the thumb.Our hands can change over time.If this line keeps developing, it will mean this royal is going to start combining logic with intuition.This will help them see things from many different perspectives.The long little fingers show this person is a really strong communicator, while the thick, strong index fingers show he will also be very persuasive.Whoever this person is, they are going to be great asset to the Royal Family.8. ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS          ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS: Complex, masculine hands, full of contradictionsThese are complex, masculine hands, full of contradictions.They look like the stubby-fingered hands of a traditional ‘builder’, solid, rough and earthy.The Life Line is deeply etched and long, showing this person has lots of energy.There is also a well-developed ‘intimacy area’ in the bottom segment of the little finger.This is someone who can share deeply with others. There are criss-crosses too in this person’s Moon Zone, at the base of the palm opposite the thumb.What this means is it’s someone who has tried lots of different mystical things.However, looking at the really short middle segment of the little fingers, this is also a person who doesn’t do negotiation.The approach is: ‘It’s my way or the highway.’9. STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGY             STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGYThis is a strong powerful palm of an older royal in the shape of a long rectangle, a sign of a person who thinks things through.There is also a strong Fate Line that stretches up vertically through their hand, showing this is someone who finishes what they start.These are also balanced hands with strong, straight fingers, which is a sign of an ethical person with a sense of self who is comfortable with their personal power.The slightly longer index finger shows they like to be in charge.They have a passionate Heart Line on both hands. So they will prioritise what they believe is important over and above other people’s feelings and needs.Their Life Line is deep and long showing they have extraordinary energy reserves.The combination of all these factors suggests a person with a clear sense of their own place in the world, something that may have served this royal well over their lifetime. 10. A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE          A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVEOn this palm, the Fate Line stops at the Heart Line.We call this The Grand Gesture — and it’s a sign of someone who will give up everything for love.However, unlike most of the other royals, the Head and Life Lines are not tied together at the start.This shows this is someone who likes to make up their own mind.Also, unlike many of the other royal hands, there isn’t a ‘platform’ where the index finger meets the palm, which is often a sign of someone who likes being in charge.However, there is a ‘platform’ underneath the ring finger on the left palm, which is her private side.This shows this royal is happiest being the boss at home, while others — perhaps a partner — take the limelight in public.AND THE ANSWERS ARE...           "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/03/12/05C7E012000007D0-0-image-a-15_1538565446946.jpg","title":"National Coming Day 2018 need know","story":"National Coming Out Day historyNational Coming Out Day was first held in 1988 by LGBTQ rights activists Robert Eichsberg and Jean O’Leary.Initially held on October 11 of that year, it marked the one-year anniversary of the Second March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights held in 1987, which itself was preceded by an earlier march held in October 1979.Since then, on or around every October 11, the event has been held throughout the world.Today the event is used to show the public the LGBTQ community exists in everyday life and to put to rest any preconceived stereotypes people may have.According to a 1992 interview with Eichsberg: ‘Most people think they don’t know anyone gay or lesbian, and in fact everybody does.

It is a genuine consultation. If we are going to improve the nation\u0027s diet, we need the support of the people, the industry and retailers . We are not going to outlaw free poppadoms.

Crisps, sweets, savoury snacks, sugary soft-drinks, cakes and pastries are all being targeted as these so-called ‘discretionary’ foods provide little nutrition and are high in sugar, salt or fat.According to a consultation document published yesterday, ‘savoury snacks’ such as prawn crackers and poppadums – often given away free with takeaways – ‘could not be part of a meal deal’.But the proposed crackdown last night sparked ridicule, while the Scottish Government attempted to backtrack.          Health campaigners claim offering free extras is helping fuel the obesity epidemic           One person claimed that any threat to the supply of prawn crackers was \u0027un-British\u0027 David Thomson, of the Food and Drink Federation in Scotland, said: ‘We are deeply disappointed that the Scottish Government is pressing ahead with legislation to restrict food and drink promotions, especially since there is no evidence of the effectiveness of these measures in tackling obesity.‘Instead of punishing Scottish businesses we would urge the Scottish Government to work in partnership with the food and drink industry.’Scottish Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said: ‘Scotland’s obesity problem is significant and should be addressed through education, physical activity and a balanced diet. But these joyless proposals are simply over the top.‘The SNP knows that banning free poppadums is not going to solve the obesity crisis, but it’s far more eye-catching than doing the hard work that will really help Scots to become healthier.’According to Cancer Research UK, obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, responsible for 2,200 cases in Scotland every year. Minister for Wellbeing Joe FitzPatrick pointed out that Scotland has one of the worst public health records in Europe and described the proposals as ‘ground-breaking’.He added: ‘No country has yet introduced such measures, so we cannot use the experience of others to demonstrate likely success.‘We should not let that dissuade us, nor should we shirk from this challenge. Scotland has a positive history of taking ambitious and pioneering action to protect the public’s health.’          The proposals are contained in a consultation paper Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or SaltThe proposals are spelled out in a consultation paper titled Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or Salt.Professor Linda Bauld, spokesman for Cancer Research UK, said: ‘The introduction of laws to curb bargain buys for food and drink high in fat and sugar would be an effective way of helping people make healthier choices.’ But Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers’ Federation, said: ‘This is yet another attempt to interfere in the way retailers go about their business and there is very little evidence that restricting promotions will have the desired effect.’Chris Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank, said: ‘The blunt anti-obesity policies... are pregnant with unintended consequences, of which banning complimentary poppadums is just one.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, admitted: ‘It will be hugely unpopular with a huge number of people but if we are to do anything serious we’ve really got to look at this problem.’When asked about the issue of prawn crackers and poppadums, a Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We have been clear that we are not looking to make restrictions in relation to main meals, and it is not our intention to restrict restaurants from including savoury foods, such as prawn crackers or poppadums, as part of meals.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Vladimir Putins annual calendars come reaction mixed","story":"    Taking the plunge: Vladimir Putin takes a topless dip in Lake Seliger, north of Moscow, during the celebration of Epiphany          Putin on the shooting range.

Kennedy\u0027s privileged childhood and teen years, growing up with his eight siblings in Massachusetts and New York, and vacationing at the family homes in Hyannis Port and Palm Beach, Florida as well as abroad. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum recently made the Kennedy family photos available for viewing online after completing an 18-month project to catalog and digitize them.Born on May 29, 2017 in Brookline, an area outside of Boston in Massachusetts, Jack, as he was called by his family and friends, was named after his maternal grandfather, John Francis Fitzgerald, a former Congressman and mayor of Boston, who was known as ‘Honey Fitz’ for his charm and charisma. From a young age, the future 35th president would follow in his namesake\u0027s footsteps: Jack was considered a ‘natural wit’ to the point his mother, Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy wrote down things that he would say, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth.’Jack would parlay that charisma and wit all the way to the highest office in the land, and along the way attend elite preparatory schools where he would win friends and titles such as \u0027Most Likely to Succeed\u0027 but not always academic accolades despite an inidualist mind that enjoyed to read. Jack battled being seriously ill off and on throughout his childhood and teens years, but remained amiable and was considered the family\u0027s joker. All of the Kennedy kids contended with their parents - Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. - contentious marriage as Kennedy Sr. had several affairs, including with actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.Rose Kennedy would have nine children – four boys and five girls – and began a ‘card-index filing system to keep track of the children’s medical histories and vital statistics’, and had a ‘daily inspection’ where she ‘looked for signs of fraying garments,’ according to the book. Jack, the second eldest after his older brother Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., ‘seemed unconcerned about dress,’ Hamilton wrote, and was at times disheveled with his shirt not tucked into his pants.          Born on May 29, 1917, John F. Kennedy was the second eldest child of the Kennedy clan.

Jack was close to death but recovered, and would face spells of sickness throughout his childhood and his teens, according to the book.Meanwhile, the family moved to a new home: a ‘colonial-style mansion with two-story, curving bay windows, a wraparound porch, fourteen rooms and a garage for the new Rolls-Royce’ in Brookline, according to the book.Rare Kennedy photos go inside America\u0027s most famous family...\u0027Childlike innocence\u0027 of JFK\u0027s eldest sister Rosemary is...EXCLUSIVE: How the bitter rivalry between sisters Jackie...Share this articleJack and his older brother, Joe, who was named after their father, were rivals, and ‘when not engaged in fisticuffs with his older brother, Jack turned more and more to books,’ according to the book. Hamilton surmises that while being ill, Jack took up the habit of reading. By aged six, Jack was promoted to second grade, and the next year to third grade when he was seven - ‘a year if not two ahead of most children his age,’ according to the book.Meanwhile his sister, Rosemary, who was a year younger than him, was a slow learner and was ‘unable to hold a knife and fork at first,’ according to the book, and Rose spent more time with her than Jack. By October 22, 1994, while Jack is in third grade at the Edward Devotion School, he pulled out of that institution and sent, along with his older brother, Joe, then nine, to the $400 a year Noble and Greenough Lower School. The Kennedy boys were likely the only Irish Catholic family at the school where most were Protestant and Anglo-Saxon, and as new boys they were the ‘object of derision and taunts,’ according to the book.           John F.

John F. Kennedy (center) has his arms around his sisters, Rosemary Kennedy (left) and Eunice Kennedy (right), outside the Kennedy family home  in Brookline, Massachusetts in May 1926          Newly available online Kennedy photos show the family vacationing often at the family homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts and Palm Beach, Florida as well as abroad. John F. Kennedy (center) is on skis on the snow-covered slopes in Poland Spring, Maine circa 1923They were driven to school by a chauffeur in a big black shiny car, and both Jack, with his ‘precocious intellect,’ and his older brother Joe liked the school despite all the ‘social and ethnic prejudice they suffered,’ Hamilton wrote. Joe and Jack were also ‘steadfastly loyal to the ex-mayor,’ their grandfather Honey Fitz, and would go campaigning with him.Among Boston’s upper crust, a contemporary of the Kennedy boys, Augustus Soule, said in Hamilton’s book that they ‘were very down on the Irish’ and that his father would have nothing to do with Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who had made money ‘in ways that were known, in banking circles, to be unsavory.’Kennedy Sr. was a wealthy businessman who manipulated share prices, according to the book, and at one time owned production companies and tried his hand as a Hollywood impresario. It was during this period that Kennedy Sr., who was considered a womanizer, had an affair with icon and actress Gloria Swanson, according to the book.When Noble and Greenough Lower School faced calamity and was on the verge of closing, Kennedy Sr. stepped in with other families to financially save it, but not long after, in September 1927, the family moved to Riverdale, a wealthy residential neighborhood in the Bronx, and the Kennedy boys started class at the exclusive, nonsectarian Riverdale Country Day School, according to the book.The family would then move to a 12-bedroom colonial in nearby Bronxville in Westchester, and ‘at last acquired a summer house at Hyannis Port, on the east coast of Cape Cod,’ according to the book. The Kennedys would vacation often - in Hyannis Port, at their sprawling property in Palm Beach, Florida, and abroad.          Joseph P.

New York society circles continued to shun the Kennedys as ‘Irish micks’ and with the Swanson scandal, the Kennedys ‘found themselves even less accepted in polite society,’ according to the book.The ‘record of parental absenteeism shockingly high’ for the Kennedy kids, and the ‘general deterioration in the relationship between mother and father created an emotional wasteland,’ Hamilton wrote.On October 29, 1929, the stock market crashes, billions are lost and the United States is plunged into the Great Depression that follows. Kennedy Sr., however, ‘had shrewdly moved most of his investments out of stocks,’ according to the book.Joe is sent to the Choate School, the elite boarding school in Connecticut, while Jack attended a boarding school in New England called the Canterbury School. At 13, Jack has an appendectomy, and would leave Canterbury to follow his older brother at Choate, according to the book. Unlike Joe, Jack had a hard time conforming to the rules and struggled academically at Choate, and Hamilton said Jack\u0027s four years at the boarding school were ‘grueling.\u0027 Jack was popular with his classmates and had a reputation for ‘wit and clownishness,\u0027 and ‘on one occasion Jack stole a life-size cardboard cutout of Mae West from the Wallingford cinema and slipped it into his bed to shock the cleaning woman the following morning,’ according to the book.          The Kennedy children had several governesses growing up, and their father, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. had affairs during his marriage to their mother Rose, according to Nigel Hamilton’s ‘JFK: Reckless Youth.’ Above, the siblings sit on the porch steps of a rented house in Cohasset, Massachusetts in 1923-1924.

She had ventured abroad seventeen times in four years, but could not manage the journey to Connecticut, where Jack lay in the hospital further north,’ Hamilton wrote.Jack would bounce back again, and once healthy, would form a group called ‘The Muckers Club’ at Choate, which wasn’t about smoking or drinking but rather about planning pranks. Jack and the other members were almost expelled for a proposed prank but the headmaster reconsidered the punishment, which would have dashed the boys\u0027 Ivy League ambitions, according to the book.Kennedy Sr. pushed his children to be competitive with a winning is everything mentality, according to the book, and a school friend said that while at first the Kennedys appeared to be a ‘model family,’ over time, the \u0027storybook façade concealed an almost psychotic drama, with Mrs. Kennedy eclipsed by her ruthless, bullying husband and the tension of that unspoken interparental hostility pervading everything. The competitiveness Mr. Kennedy generate among his nine children was awesomely fascinating.’Hamilton added: ‘Perhaps most damaging of all was the sexual example Joseph Kennedy set for his children. Jack came home from school to having his father cover his bed with pornographic magazines ‘all open to display the female anatomy at its most immodest.’Jack would vie for ‘Most Likely to Succeed’ at Choate and win. By the summer of 1935, Jack found out that he got into Harvard and would be put on a path toward the presidency.          John F.

As two of them are now dead, she is affectionately known as the Black Widow and currently has a younger partner, five-year-old Jubilee. All I can do is wish him well.I have something of a troubled relationship with Munin. Sometimes I think she hates me.She has been giving me the run-around for years and, since research suggests that ravens can recognise human faces, I can only assume that I did something horrendous in my early days at the Tower for which she has never forgiven me.Woe betide the next fox that tries to eat a Tower of London...The \u0027Temple of Transportation\u0027 that Jackie Kennedy helped...Share this articleI started working here as a Yeoman Warder, as we Beefeaters are properly known, in 2005.All of us, servicemen and women, have long records of unblemished service — in my case, almost 25 years as an infantryman.That took me all over the world and eventually to the Tower of London, with its bloody history of murder, torture and, of course, ravens.Without them, the legend goes, great harm will befall the kingdom and the Tower itself will crumble into dust.      Tradition: Two ravens pictured in the Tower of London in the 1960sThe man had managed to capture Munin using only a holdall and a blanket — together with a thick pair of gardening gloves and some chicken legs to tempt her.Thanking him for helping us to save the kingdom, we placed Munin in her travel box and made our way back to the Tower, where I reflected on an important lesson. Never underestimate the ravens.I often try to see the Tower through their eyes: the sheer looming mass of the buildings, like cliffs, and the continual hubbub of sound, like the howl of the tundra all those potential playmates and the ever-present threat of predators.We will never know all of what goes on inside their heads but they certainly seem to have the capacity to remember.When Derrick Coyle visited the Tower some seven years after leaving as Ravenmaster, for example, Merlina came straight to him. It was as if he’d never been away. Seven years!Following my time in the Army, caring for the ravens has meant becoming a part of another family — learning to trust and be trusted —and doing what I can to the best of my ability when they need my help.And if you have enjoyed reading about my life with these remarkable creatures, perhaps I can ask a small favour.Years from now, long after our current ravens have gone, and I, too, have passed on to that great raven enclosure in the sky, you may be visiting the Tower. Perhaps there will be a raven there named after me, and this Skaife may be looking at you in that way only ravens can.Don’t get too close — he may bite. But say hello from me.Kn-ck, kn-ck.

The company has invested in a new factory in SlovakiaSpeculation about the size, shape and timing of the new generation Defender - the original Land Rover of 1948  - has been rife since its production ended with a series of collectors\u0027 special editions.The Defender began as the original Land Rover  and this year is celebrating its 70th anniversary.Loved by the Queen, driven by Winston Churchill and adored by millions loyal drivers including soldiers of the British Army and SAS - it was launched on April 30, 1948 at the Amsterdam Motor Show.The original Land Rover started life as a squiggle in the sand when, shortly after the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey the workhorse vehicle he needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then using.          Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Rover director Maurice Wilks sketched out the original Land Rover in the sand on a beach near his holiday cottage in Anglesey, Wales          The vehicle was needed to replace the American army surplus Jeep he was then usingSo in 1948 Britain\u0027s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and launched at that year\u0027s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world\u0027s first mass-produced civilian 4X4 costing £450. With post-war rationing and steel in short supply but masses of aluminium around, the vehicle was initially made with the lightweight metal.

The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land Rover.          In 1948 Britain\u0027s answer to the ubiquitous Jeep – the Land Rover - was born and launched at that year\u0027s Amsterdam Motor Show as the world\u0027s first mass-produced civilian 4X4          Land Rover holds a royal warrant, as supplier to the royal household. The royal relationship with Land Rover goes back to 1948 when King George VI viewed the original Land RoverThe Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first one shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has used Land Rovers ever since.The Queen used a specially adapted one for her first world tour in 1953, Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell, while another was used for Pope John Paul II\u0027s tour of England in 1982.And shortly after ending his love affair with young Princess Margaret in the 1950s, former battle of Britain pilot Group Captain Peter Townsend set off on a 57,000 mile journey around the world in his short Wheelbase Land Rover Station Wagon which he completed in 1957 and chronicled in his book \u0027Earth, My Friend.\u0027          The Queen, who is regularly photographed at the wheel, took delivery of her first Land Rover shortly after coming to the throne in 1952 and has consistently driven them ever since          Winston Churchill was given one as an 80th birthday present at his home in Chartwell          Pictured: The current version of the Land Rover Defender with historic \u0027HUE\u0027 license plateThe Defender became a regular movie star featuring heavily in the film Born Free (1966) about the story of Elsa the Lion. Defenders are still used today by the Born Free Foundation whose founder Virginia McKenna OBE was in the movie. Hollywood actor Steve McQueen was a fan. It also featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond movie, Skyfall.The Defender name itself can be traced back to 1990. It was created to avoid confusion with a new Land Rover launched the previous year called Discovery.Military versions of the Defender have seen service around the globe and the armed forces have purchased almost 200,000 variants of the UK built Land Rover with the most famous being those used by the SAS in the desert, nicknamed \u0027pinkies\u0027 after their painted camouflage colour designed to blend with the dunes.To cheering and applause from the workforce at Land Rover\u0027s Solihull factory near Birmingham, the final Land Rover Defender 4X4 drove off the production line in January 2016 and joined the firm\u0027s heritage collection. A radical new generation Defender is to be launched next year.          The Defender became a regular movie star featuring heavily in the film Born Free (1966)          It featured in the Angelina Jolie film Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and in the James Bond film SkyfallTo mark the final year of the classic Defender Land Rover launched a series of official special editions ranging in price from £27,800 to £61,845.At the Frankfurt Motor Show seven years ago Jaguar Land Rover signalled how potential hi-tech replacements for the Defender would look, unveiling a macho, open-topped off-roader - codenamed DS100 Sport - designed to be as useful off-road as the trusty original. It also showed off a more fun-packed version looking like a beach-buggy, as well as a more practical workhorse version.In January, Land Rover announced plans to \u0027sympathetically renovate\u0027 the world\u0027s most historically significant unrestored model – one of three pre-production cars from the original Amsterdam motor show launch on 30th April 1948.It will take the stage at the Land Rover Classic event alongside its closest modern relative – the 405PS Defender Works V8 revealed earlier this year, of which only 150 will be produced."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/22/05694822000007D0-6232139-Reality_TV_shows_like_Love_Island_are_dangerous_to_children_and_-a-1_1538515497714.jpg","title":"Headteacher asks girls MeToo seriously value nonsense","story":"    Jane Lunnon, headteacher of Wimbledon High School, has serious concerns about the effect social media and reality showsReality TV shows like Love Island sends an \u0027unbelievably dangerous\u0027 message to young people that could undermine the #MeToo movement, a head teacher has said.Jane Lunnon, head of Wimbledon High School, has serious concerns about the effect social media and reality shows have on body image and self worth.The headteacher thinks that if we want the #MeToo movement to be taken seriously, girls shouldn\u0027t celebrate \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture.  Speaking at the Headmasters\u0027 and Headmistresses\u0027 Conference\u0027s (HMC) annual autumn conference she said social media and reality stars are \u0027image-obsessed\u0027.Mrs Lunnon said: \u0027I was particularly struck by the Love Island thing - it wasn\u0027t just the way it dominated teen consciousness, it was the way it basically dominated public discourse.\u0027So what has happened that makes Love Island become something real and significant?          Reality TV shows like Love Island are \u0027dangerous\u0027 to children and could undermine #MeToo movementMrs Lunnon says young people might not be able to distinguish between what is real and what is fake.She said: \u0027The problem attached to that is what are the long-term consequences of a world where a) we are celebrating something essentially trivial, and b) we are focused, such relentless focus on appearance and the presentation of brand self - which we know is a spillover from social media itself.\u0027And Love Island\u0027s message, it seems to me, is conform and look beautiful otherwise you are not worthy of being loved.Kim Kardashian is the \u0027most dangerous\u0027 celebrity to search...Share this article \u0027Which is unbelievably dangerous.

Love Island was described as \u0027trivial\u0027 reality TV culture which obsesses over image by Mrs Lunnon\u0027So there is nothing wrong with a bit of light-hearted entertainment at all.\u0027Mrs Lunnon explained that one way to tackle the effect of reality TV and social media would be for schools to remind students they belong to a community.She added that in recent years she had witnessed pupils become increasing engaged in political debate, something she found promising.\u0027It is youthquake rather than snowflake, I think. I think we should stop telling kids that they are insignificant and fragile and vulnerable.\u0027The snowflake thing is not helpful. They could change things, and if we get them to take themselves seriously and take the world seriously, they will,\u0027 said Mrs Lunnon.Veteran broadcaster Michael Buerk, who also spoke at the conference, said the age of social media and reality TV shows had seen public discourse become increasingly shallow.\u0027They are about us looking at ourselves, albeit in the mirror of other people’s lives, not interrogating the outside world.\u0027And they are making us ignorant, stupid and unhappy.

A lot in Lathrop, California is pictured here          One customer demanded to know where her new Tesla was. The frustration only grew after she saw  hundreds of them parked up in a lot in Salt, Lake City, Utah          Elon Musk tweeted that there were problems with delivering cars to customers following this angry Tweet from a customerThe company announced Tuesday that it produced 80,142 vehicles in the third quarter, marking a 50 percent increase over the previous quarter and when the company hit its target for the first time in the last week of June, some questioned whether the feat was sustainable.But it appears that there are other problems facing the company. Since July, Tesla has been parking anywhere from a couple of dozen to a few hundred cars at a lot in Burbank, California. It\u0027s a similar story in the town of Lathrop near San Francisco where Tesla has 400 cars at an industrial site according to the New York Times.Hundreds more have been located in in Antioch, northeast of San Fran. Last week, the newspaper reported that another batch of 100 Model 3s cars  in Bellevue, Washington with further batches in Chicago, Dallas, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.Delta aircraft is evacuated after aborting its takeoff at...Who toppled the statue? Mystery in Philadelphia after...Share this article    The company has refused to comment on the reason for the surplus other than to say there were delivery problems at one stage          Some have suggested the full lots are because demand for Teslas isn\u0027t a great as the company advertises          Internet sleuths have taken to sending up drones and even flown in private planes to snap pictures of the parking lots containing dozens of the parked-up TeslasThe vehicles, which have all been parked on private property, have been uncovered by amateur detectives many of whom have flown drones over the parking lots to take pictures of the sitting cars.Another ended up taking to the skies in a private plane to snap hi-res photos from the air before posting them on Twitter. The sleuths are betting that Tesla\u0027s share price will fall and suggest Elon Musk has not been truthful about the company\u0027s current situation, particularly its sales numbers.The existence of such massive lots full of cars are likely proof that something is amiss at the company. A Tesla spokesman, Dave Arnold, said by email to the Times that the large lots of vehicles were \u0027logistics transit hubs\u0027 and added, \u0027Anyone observing those lots will see a change from one day to the next.\u0027           One photographer took to the skies in order to capture the cast numbers of cars sitting idle           Tesla Inc. vehicles sit in a parking lot outside of a newly constructed production tent at the company\u0027s manufacturing facility in Fremont, California           Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year - but then why are so many of the cars going nowhere? Production increases are something Musk worked nearly to exhaustion to achieve. He has publicly said he has been working as much as 120 hours per week and sometimes even slept on Tesla\u0027s factory floor in Fremont, California, to oversee the efforts to make more cars. The company even built a heavy-duty tent to add space to make more Model 3s.But doubts remain whether the company can continue to crank out enough vehicles to achieve profitability, something that still eludes Tesla.Although it successfully reached its production goals for the third quarter, getting those vehicles into the hands of consumers has proven to be a headache.Tesla delivered 83,500 vehicles in the third quarter, which is more than 80 percent of the vehicles that it delivered all of last year.But one other theory is that the presence of parking lots with hundreds of Teslas all parked up with no place to go, could mean that there is a delivery problem.          At one point, Elon Musk suggested that there was a shortage with hauliers transporting cars  CEO Elon Musk has pledged to work out the manufacturing problems that have raised questions about the electric car maker\u0027s future prospectsCustomers have been complaining that their Tesla delivery dates have been delayed over and over while vehicles sit unmoved in lots. One tweeted to Musk last month: \u0027There are 42 Tesla\u0027s sitting at the Union Pacific Railroad in SLC. My car is one of these. I\u0027ve been told I was getting delivery the 8th, then the 15th, then the 20th, then the 22nd, and now my delivery has been delayed indefinite. @Tesla @elonmusk... Please make this right.\u0027Musk tweeted back and acknowledged the problem: \u0027Sorry, we\u0027ve gone from production hell to delivery logistics hell, but this problem is far more tractable. We\u0027re making rapid progress. Should be solved shortly.\u0027Musk attributed the problem to a shortage of trucks to haul cars around the country but others disagree saying there is \u0027plenty of car haulage capacity.\u0027  \u0027The Auto Haulers Association of America is not aware of any shortage of car haulers, nor of any other automakers that are having trouble shipping new vehicles,\u0027 said  Guy Young from the organization.Musk has even said that Tesla has developed its own trailers to transport cars to customers but no new designs have been approved by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which regulates such transporters.          The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Thousands are sitting in lots around the country          Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot featureEither way, it is clear that Tesla appears to have failed to set up an efficient way of delivering the hundreds of cars a day it is producing.The only other alternative is that demand is far less than Tesla is suggesting and the reason there are so many lots full of the costly cars is because there are simply no buyers.     Musk had promised the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000 but the cheapest now starts at $49,000, and is closer to $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance feature.More could be revealed in the coming days when Tesla reports production and delivery data for the last three months.But patience is wearing thin for people who have already put down $1,000 to get on a waiting list for the Model 3.Tesla has never turned an annual profit during its eight-year history and rarely done it on a quarterly basis, but it needs to reverse that trend to erase doubts about its survival.The company has been under mounting pressure to stop burning through cash with $1.3 billion of its more than $10 billion in debt due to be repaid during the next six months.Musk will give up his post as Tesla\u0027s chairman for at least three years after tweeting in August tweet that he would take the company private and had \u0027funding secured\u0027 for the deal.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit Thursday that said the tweet constituted securities fraud because Musk knew he hadn\u0027t lined up the money for such a deal.Critics, including some investors, had pushed for similar changes recently, arguing that a new chairman and a board less tied to Musk would be good for Tesla and its investors. Some have argued Musk should even give up the CEO role and assume a post such as chief technical officer.The SEC said it wanted to bar Musk from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded company, a scary option for investors who felt Musk was nearly synonymous with Tesla and that another executive would have trouble managing Tesla\u0027s manufacturing challenges and keeping the public satisfied in spite of Tesla\u0027s substantial debts.Unraveling a Tesla Mystery: Lots (and Lots) of Parked Cars - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/02/18/50EDE65100000578-0-image-m-30_1538501234483.jpg","title":"A day life Gisele Coconut oil sun gazing aromatherapy foot massages kids","story":"    Gisele Bundchen, 38, the supermodel wife of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, has just published new book Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life - which details her daily routine, workout regime, diet and meditation schedule          She and Brady are parents to son Benny, 8, and daughter Vivi, 5, as well as the athlete\u0027s older son, Jack, from a previous relationship with actress Bridget Moynahan          Gisele writes her day starts between 5am and 6am, when she rises to \u0027ocean\u0027 sounds on her phone she then spends up to 15 minutes swilling coconut oil in her mouth in a process known as \u0027pulling\u0027     Gisele, a native of Brazil, married Brady in 2009 the model writes: \u0027It’s up to all of us to capture time, to give it meaning, and to be present and appreciative for every moment we’re alive\u0027          Gisele, pictured in the web television series Tom vs Time, lives outside of Boston with Brady and their family, in addition to enjoying a property in Montana\u0027s exclusive Yellowstone Club - which featured heavily in the program          Gisele says her children perform daily chores, and she emphasizes cleaning she likes to leave \u0027rooms as tidy as I found them\u0027          Gisele writes in the book that she enjoys taking her children to school herself each night, she gives \u0027them each a quick foot massage using aromatherapy oils, of which I have an entire pharmacy.

The left hands reveal their private sides.’Can this be true? We asked Helen to read these royal palms without knowing who they belonged to. The results were uncannily accurate...    The lines on the right hand represent the side the royals want to show the public. The left hands reveal their private sides, palm expert reveals 1. A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION          A HAPPY HUMANITARIAN IN SEARCH OF A MISSION: Feminine with long, willowy fingersThese hands are very feminine. From the long, willowy fingers, it’s clear these are the hands of a sensitive, artistic person. This is the most interesting royal palm thanks to a very unusual feature on the right hand, known as a Simian Line.Usually the Head Line and Heart Line are separate and spaced apart as they run into the centre of the palm. However, on this royal, it shows up as only one line which ides the hand in half horizontally.This special feature is known as a ‘gift marker’ —and reveals a person of enormous drive, energy and focus. Add this to the long, straight Heart Line on their left hand, it reveals a considerate person likely to be a humanitarian.This person will also need a mission which they can pour their energy into to be happy. This is not a royal who will want to hide behind the scenes, more someone who will take to the world stage and make a positive impact.Also, the equal length of ring and index fingers mean they really understand feelings which will also make them a good parent.2. CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD            CHILDLIKE REBEL WITH A PASSION FOR FOOD: Thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature sideThe thick bases on this royal’s fingers hint at a childlike, immature side, or perhaps a passion for food. The ruddy colour and bloated appearance of the hands also suggest this is a person who needs to pay more attention to their health. The Life Line is short too, suggesting low energy.The length of the fingers also show this is a royal who loves to talk.The slightly longer ring finger suggests they love a bit of appreciation and applause — if they weren’t a royal they could have been a celebrity food critic!Other markers show this royal may feel conflicted by the expectations of being a member of the Royal Family.For example, the Life Line and Head Line start and stay together for about an inch, so this person is comfortable following the traditions they’ve grown up with. However, this conflicts with the shortish middle finger, which suggests a desire to rebel or break ‘the rules’.That could mean this member of ‘The Firm’ is not sure how to get his needs met and still fit in with the expectations of his position.  3. THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE            THINKER WHO CARES ABOUT APPEARANCE: Slightly longer ring fingers emphasis someone who can be quite analyticalThis royal has the fingers and palm of a thinker, someone who can be quite analytical, emphasised by her slightly longer ring fingers.This means she is probably quite visual and her appearance may be quite important. It also means this is someone who thrives on appreciation and applause!This royal holds their little finger off to the side, suggesting a highly private person who prefers not to expose their vulnerabilities.Both thumbs are held close to her palm, suggesting again they like to play their cards close to their chest.All in all, a strong inidual capable of restraint in pursuit of what she believes in.4. FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION          FROM YOUNG REBEL TO INSPIRATION: Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional valuesThe three lines, crossed by three others, at the bottom of this royal’s index finger, shows this is someone with very high standards.Like many royal palms, the Head and Heart Lines are tied together, showing this royal has traditional values. However, the short distance between the height of this person’s middle fingers and their index and ring fingers, shows they have a rebellious streak. This is likely to have shown up more in their youth.There are also four short parallel lines under the joint between the ring and little fingers. This is ‘the gifted healer’. It can mean someone who is inspirational in helping others.It’s possible this royal will have expressed this through charity work. 5. A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE          A HEDONIST WHO LOVES TO TAKE CHARGE: Area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plumpThe area under the thumb of this manly hand is quite plump.This shows a person who likes to have fun and may have been a bit of a hedonist in their youth. This royal’s Heart Line is curvy, showing that they are naturally passionate.However, as the line straightens out towards the end, it suggests this person curbs their passionate nature, possibly out of duty.In both hands, the index, or pointer-finger, looks the strongest and has more of a ‘platform’ or fleshy pad. This suggests someone who has put a lot of energy into being in charge, carving out their turf and leading the way in what matters to them.As these qualities also show up on the left hand, this royal will be no walkover at home either — and that will help make them a good parent and partner. 6. CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE          CHATTERBOX WHO’S ALWAYS IN TROUBLE: Middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebelThe middle fingers of this royal’s hands are not much longer than the index and ring fingers, a sure sign of a rebel.This person also has a light, horizontal line joining the Head and Heart line. This means it’s hard for them to decide whether to go with their heart or logic. A slightly upward curving Heart Line shows a caring character who tries to do the right thing, even if their inner rebel sometimes gets them into trouble.The way their vertical Fate Line — also known as a Saturn Line — underneath the middle finger stops at the Head Line shows this side probably kicks in when they get bored.The little finger is long, suggesting this is a person who probably loves to talk.The ring at the base of their little finger, covering the bottom segment — the intimacy zone — also shows this person wants to protect themselves from being hurt emotionally.7. A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE          A LOGICAL THINKER WHO GETS THE JOB DONE: A square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done’ This royal has a square, masculine hand which basically says: ‘Let me get the job done.’His Head Line is the straightest and least curved of them all, revealing this is the most logical person in the family.There is also a Fate Line which goes up vertically through his palm towards his middle finger.This shows someone who is a doer who follows through.This royal’s Head Line is long and straight and stretches into his zone of intuition — the plumper area down the side of your palm opposite the thumb.Our hands can change over time.If this line keeps developing, it will mean this royal is going to start combining logic with intuition.This will help them see things from many different perspectives.The long little fingers show this person is a really strong communicator, while the thick, strong index fingers show he will also be very persuasive.Whoever this person is, they are going to be great asset to the Royal Family.8. ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS          ‘BUILDER’ DRAWN TO MYSTICAL THINGS: Complex, masculine hands, full of contradictionsThese are complex, masculine hands, full of contradictions.They look like the stubby-fingered hands of a traditional ‘builder’, solid, rough and earthy.The Life Line is deeply etched and long, showing this person has lots of energy.There is also a well-developed ‘intimacy area’ in the bottom segment of the little finger.This is someone who can share deeply with others. There are criss-crosses too in this person’s Moon Zone, at the base of the palm opposite the thumb.What this means is it’s someone who has tried lots of different mystical things.However, looking at the really short middle segment of the little fingers, this is also a person who doesn’t do negotiation.The approach is: ‘It’s my way or the highway.’9. STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGY             STRONG, POWERFUL AND BRIMMING WITH ENERGYThis is a strong powerful palm of an older royal in the shape of a long rectangle, a sign of a person who thinks things through.There is also a strong Fate Line that stretches up vertically through their hand, showing this is someone who finishes what they start.These are also balanced hands with strong, straight fingers, which is a sign of an ethical person with a sense of self who is comfortable with their personal power.The slightly longer index finger shows they like to be in charge.They have a passionate Heart Line on both hands. So they will prioritise what they believe is important over and above other people’s feelings and needs.Their Life Line is deep and long showing they have extraordinary energy reserves.The combination of all these factors suggests a person with a clear sense of their own place in the world, something that may have served this royal well over their lifetime. 10. A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVE          A ROYAL WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR LOVEOn this palm, the Fate Line stops at the Heart Line.We call this The Grand Gesture — and it’s a sign of someone who will give up everything for love.However, unlike most of the other royals, the Head and Life Lines are not tied together at the start.This shows this is someone who likes to make up their own mind.Also, unlike many of the other royal hands, there isn’t a ‘platform’ where the index finger meets the palm, which is often a sign of someone who likes being in charge.However, there is a ‘platform’ underneath the ring finger on the left palm, which is her private side.This shows this royal is happiest being the boss at home, while others — perhaps a partner — take the limelight in public.AND THE ANSWERS ARE...           "},{"url":null,"title":"What catch Incredible moment retired bear grabs slice bread MOUTH","story":"    The footage, filmed from the inside of a car, captured the \u0027retired show bear\u0027 as it sat on the grass inside a fenced areaThe passenger then threw a piece of sliced bread from the car like a frisbee, the bear ducking its head as it approached.But just as it seemed like the bread was destined for the floor, the creature quickly snapped its jaw - swallowing the snack in one bite.Throw me a bone!

It is a genuine consultation. If we are going to improve the nation\u0027s diet, we need the support of the people, the industry and retailers . We are not going to outlaw free poppadoms. But we definitely have free unlimited refills for sugary drinks in our sights.\u0027We are keen to talk about free refills on sugary drinks. If the retailer is offering unlimited full-fat drink because you\u0027ve bought a sandwich, that is something we want to talk about ending.\u0027The rules would be enshrined in law and firms breaching them would be issued with fixed penalty notices.But retailers last night warned this would ‘punish’ businesses, with no evidence it would even work – while opposition politicians branded the proposal ‘joyless’.Unlimited drink refills would be outlawed, and staff would be forbidden from ‘upselling’ through ‘go large’ deals at the tills.Couple are selling their \u0027dream home\u0027 with its own private...Plant-lover turns his back-garden in Coventry into tropical...Share this articleThere would also be a ban on loyalty card points for junk food, and customers would not be able to use money-off coupons when buying unhealthy snacks.Retailers would even be prevented from placing such items in prominent display areas, such as near the tills. Crisps, sweets, savoury snacks, sugary soft-drinks, cakes and pastries are all being targeted as these so-called ‘discretionary’ foods provide little nutrition and are high in sugar, salt or fat.According to a consultation document published yesterday, ‘savoury snacks’ such as prawn crackers and poppadums – often given away free with takeaways – ‘could not be part of a meal deal’.But the proposed crackdown last night sparked ridicule, while the Scottish Government attempted to backtrack.

But these joyless proposals are simply over the top.‘The SNP knows that banning free poppadums is not going to solve the obesity crisis, but it’s far more eye-catching than doing the hard work that will really help Scots to become healthier.’According to Cancer Research UK, obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking, responsible for 2,200 cases in Scotland every year. Minister for Wellbeing Joe FitzPatrick pointed out that Scotland has one of the worst public health records in Europe and described the proposals as ‘ground-breaking’.He added: ‘No country has yet introduced such measures, so we cannot use the experience of others to demonstrate likely success.‘We should not let that dissuade us, nor should we shirk from this challenge. Scotland has a positive history of taking ambitious and pioneering action to protect the public’s health.’          The proposals are contained in a consultation paper Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or SaltThe proposals are spelled out in a consultation paper titled Reducing Health Harms of Foods High in Fat, Sugar or Salt.Professor Linda Bauld, spokesman for Cancer Research UK, said: ‘The introduction of laws to curb bargain buys for food and drink high in fat and sugar would be an effective way of helping people make healthier choices.’ But Dr John Lee, of the Scottish Grocers’ Federation, said: ‘This is yet another attempt to interfere in the way retailers go about their business and there is very little evidence that restricting promotions will have the desired effect.’Chris Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think-tank, said: ‘The blunt anti-obesity policies... are pregnant with unintended consequences, of which banning complimentary poppadums is just one.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, admitted: ‘It will be hugely unpopular with a huge number of people but if we are to do anything serious we’ve really got to look at this problem.’When asked about the issue of prawn crackers and poppadums, a Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘We have been clear that we are not looking to make restrictions in relation to main meals, and it is not our intention to restrict restaurants from including savoury foods, such as prawn crackers or poppadums, as part of meals.’  "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry high fives Chichester pupils skipped class Meghan","story":"    This is the hilarious moment Prince Harry gave a cheeky student a high five after he confessed he was missing a double Latin class to see the Duke and his new wife on their visit to Sussex           The Duke of Sussex high fives a school child during a walkabout in Chichester this morningThe painstakingly-made A3 book featured everything from Arundel to local celebrity Zoe Ball.Harry immediately spotted the youngsters and exclaimed: \u0027You\u0027ve got a very, very similar school uniform to the one I had when I was at Wetherby School in London, all those years ago.

Andy Palmer, the chief executive, said he was focused on the long-term outlook for the business and not the share price on the first day of trading.The flotation has been held up as a test of investor appetite to back British companies, as the UK prepares to leave the EU in March next year.Mark Wilson, the company’s chief financial officer, said Aston Martin was prepared for Brexit. “We’ve been around for 105 years and the company has gone through some pretty turbulent times in that period. We see Brexit as a road bump and we’ll steer through it.”Wilson said it was helpful that Aston Martin was a global firm, selling into a range of markets, and therefore able to offset any dip in business in one location with growth in another. The IPO marks a remarkable turnaround for a business that has gone bust seven times since it was founded by Robert Bamford and Lionel Martin in a small London workshop in 1913.Jasper Lawler, analyst at London Capital Group, said it was the most hotly anticipated IPO of the year.“The first public listing of a British carmaker in decades has the kind of ‘dinner party’ appeal that few IPOs share. We think the iconic status of this century-old British motoring brand, coupled with its relative insulation against Brexit or trade tensions, make this listing a compelling proposition.”The company is hoping its stock-market listing will allow it to invest in greater production volumes and new products.Aston Martin is now one of the world’s biggest sports car brands. Palmer has overhauled the business by revamping the product lineup and returning it to profit after years of losses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00f7a165a22d411e950fb9a4da0ba285c272a90/15_257_2113_1267/master/2113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d4b47a19ab94eaa60aa3358154a7572","title":"noel edmonds lloyds bank ads hbos reading","story":"Former Deal or No Deal host in dispute over bank’s handling of HBOS fraud scandalNoel Edmonds has failed in a bid to get Lloyds Bank’s black horse TV ads banned, as the TV presenter’s £60m legal battle with the banking group becomes increasingly acrimonious.The former Deal or No Deal presenter’s claim stems from a historic fraud scandal at the bank’s HBOS Reading arm, which affected 60 small business owners, relating to losses from the collapse of his entertainment firm Unique Group a decade ago, as well as the distress and humiliation he says he has suffered.Keystone Law, representing Edmonds and other victims of the fraud, lodged a complaint with the advertising regulator against the bank’s TV campaign featuring its famous black horse.The ad campaign features a black horse running past a memorial service, a neighbourhood with a mother caring for her baby and on a beach with children. A voiceover said: “Yesterday, today, and tomorrow we have been and always will be by your side.” Music lyrics in the background included the line “we’ve come a long, long way together, through the hard times and the good”.The law firm said that the ad campaign was misleading and should be banned because it objected to the way Lloyds Bank, which acquired HBOS after the fraud, had handled customers affected by the scandal.The Advertising Standards Authority rejected Keystone’s complaint, saying the ad did not break its rules.The watchdog said the claim to customers to literally be “by your side” was “advertising puffery”.The ASA said it did not believe that viewers “would interpret the claim to be a commentary on the situation of the victims of the HBOS fraud case, or to think that it was directly connected to their engagement with Lloyds Bank in 2018”.“We did not consider the details of the HBOS fraud case to be material information that needed to be included in the ad to prevent customers from being misled.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1cba5014a8604dc4672db98c529c6d7bc62245/40_0_4066_2440/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f485cc88f40227c45be838dab0223312","title":"tory conference government brexit","story":"Seeing these dysfunctional ‘parents’ up close, it all makes sense. Their squabbles have infected our lives, and ided usWhat have we, the people of Britain, done to the Conservative party? Why do they hate us so much? As the odours from their annual feasting in Birmingham drift over the airwaves, I find my responses metastasising beyond the merely political and into the realms of the psychological.I get the sense that they’re punishing us, somehow. That there’s some deep-seated Jungian weirdness being acted out on the British public, every time the zealot Daniel Hannan vows to feed us his chlorinated chicken, every time Jeremy Hunt threatens us with his leadership credentials. It’s as if we (Britain) are the child. And they (the Tories) are the dysfunctional parents, ripping themselves apart, occasionally grabbing us by the wrists to prove some sort of point to the other.Theresa May comes up for air. She would like it to be known that she hopes to end freedom of movement within the European Union. She will remove – just like that! – our right to work in France or retire in Spain as that, she has decided, is what we want. She seems weirdly proud about it, too, a little bit “Look what you made me do.” But no member of the British public asked for this. No one made her do it other than the peculiar tribe to which she has pledged allegiance.There’s something similarly demented about Boris Johnson’s ambitions too. You don’t want this reckless narcissist in charge of the country. No one wants that. Aside from perhaps, a certain portion of the 120,000-odd people who are still perverse enough to be members of the Tory party – because it’s his turn. And somehow, by some convoluted ancestral logic, this is the wing who must be appeased, these are the appetites that must be indulged, these are the people who might actually decide.England, as George Orwell once wrote, is a family with the wrong members in control. There are the rich relations who must be sucked up to, the poor relations who must be spat upon, and it’s best not to ask too many questions about where all the wealth came from. And remember: “It is a family in which the young are generally thwarted and most of the power is in the hands of irresponsible uncles and bedridden aunts.” Just as adult family squabbles bring with them that same sense of “Why am I still dealing with this shit?”, so it is here: the patrician fossils aren’t talking to the reckless Atlanticists, and the oleaginous metropolitan wing is at odds with the racist granddads – and Cousin Jacob must have his special plate. Stop being the difficult one!Toxic introspection is not confined to the Tories. There is a certain species of Labourite who believes their own internal squabbles are of paramount interest to Labour voters too. But at least this tendency of the left was counterbalanced by a set of coherent ideas emerging from the Labour conference, a vision for the sort of country we might like to become. There is none of that emerging from Birmingham – no policies, no direction from our bedridden aunt of a prime minister.The reason all this feels more personal than political is that Tory dysfunction has already infected our lives. No one outside the Tory membership much cared much about the European Union prior to David Cameron calling a referendum. The 2016 vote was intended as a way of resolving the Tory family squabble. All it has done is impose it on the nation as a whole their problem is now our problem.And perhaps the most insidious effect is the way that Brexit has entered actual families too, setting children against parents, sibling against sibling, such that the word “Brexit” conjures something beyond mere trade deals and treaties. It has poisoned relationships, distanced generations, infected homes. For a party that is supposed to stand up for family values, that will be quite a legacy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae429ba245616c1c029e91f18963a1b739b2bb4/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ac7af99ef87313f0877964dc94d46ad","title":"darwin theory evolution schools earth","story":"In recent weeks there have been alarming reports from both Israel and Turkey of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution being erased from school curriculums. In Turkey, this has been blamed on the concept of evolution – which is taught in British primary schools – being beyond the understanding of high school students. In Israel, teachers are claiming that most students do not learn about evolution they say their education ministry is quietly encouraging teachers to focus on other topics in biology.This news follows the astonishing statements made by India’s minister for higher education earlier this year. Satyapal Singh claimed Darwin was “scientifically wrong”, and is demanding that the theory of evolution be removed from school curriculums because no one “ever saw an ape turning into a human being”.It is tempting to shrug off these latest attacks on Darwin’s greatest contribution to natural science. After all, no other scientific theory has attracted the same level of impassioned opposition and detraction – certainly not for more than 150 years. But that would be to miss the particular urgency of improving our scientific understanding of the natural world and how best to protect it for the future.Darwin’s theory of evolution not only underpins all biological science, it has an immense predictive power. From understanding the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms, to the ways in which different species might respond to global warming – emerging as new pests or sustainable sources of food – human health and prosperity will depend on decisions informed by evolutionary evidence.At the Natural History Museum, we have a unique collection of over 80m specimens, which ranges from 2.7bn-year-old fossils to specimens collected in 2018. Accessed by our own 350 scientists and thousands of researchers annually from all over the world, this collection provides crucial baseline data against which changes in both the form and ersity of life can be measured over millions of years. The fantastic ersity of life and the molecular composition of life past and present in our collection is clear, concrete, accumulated evidence of evolution.And yet … evolution is still questioned. Religious-based opposition aside, one reason for doubt seems to be the sheer unimaginable scale of what it describes. To understand evolution, you have to accept the concept of deep time – an immense arc of non-human history in which humanity’s time on this planet barely registers. Darwin himself said: “What an infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years!”From our own experience at the museum, the term “theory” is also partly to blame. It’s used interchangeably with idea, hunch, intuition, guess – all implying absence of substantive proof. Yet since its inception in the late 19th century, evolutionary theory has been thoroughly challenged and rigorously tested across a range of scientific disciplines by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. It is considered irrefutable scientific law.So how should we respond to overt or insidious attempts to undermine this vital scientific concept? We must – of course – teach it in schools as the core part of any science curriculum. And we must speak up to defend scientific evidence and rational debate. But more than these things, we must inspire children with the sheer wonder and variety of nature, and ignite their curiosity in the world around them. These ideas are at the heart of all our public engagement at the Natural History Museum, because we believe that reconnecting with nature and empowering our visitors to understand how the choices we make could impact the world around us are urgent, vital tasks.It may be a serious business, but it is never dull. In the first-ever play to be staged at the museum in a performance theatre, The Wider Earth charts Darwin’s perilous voyage aboard HMS Beagle and brings to life, through intricate puppets, some of the exotic wildlife he encountered.

The ban on combustible materials will bring the rest of the UK into line with Scotland and the EU, allowing only A1 or A2 “limited combustibility” materials on the external walls of residential buildings 18 metres or more tall.The move has been greeted with a guarded welcome from families, who are waiting for more detail. There is little doubt that their campaign has brought about the change. Earlier in the year, the government was set to approve the use of desktop studies to clear materials used on high-rise buildings. The consultation on combustibles was announced the same day as a public outcry over the Hackitt review, which reported back in May. The Grenfell Tower inquiry is yet to make any interim recommendations, and does not yet appear to have appointed a cladding expert.How government implements this ban, particularly around the use of desktop studies and exemptions, will be important. For some, it may not go far enough. This is an industry that demonstrably cannot self-regulate when it comes to safety. Even now, contractors at the inquiry have been criticised for being disingenuous. Anyone who has watched videos of the speed and spread of the fire across the north-east face of Grenfell Tower will understand why this ban is important. Between 12.56am and 1.20am on 14 June 2017, fire zipped up the side of Grenfell Tower. It then moved horizontally through a “crown” of combustible material. It spread downwards and diagonally across the building and back inside through open windows. Jets were trained on the external fire, but they “bounced off”. One firefighter described the flames as spitting “like magnesium”. This was a fire of petroleum-based, highly flammable products, combustible at a low temperature, piled one on top of another in the damp-proof course, the cavity infill, the insulation, the windows, and the cladding cassettes.On Tuesday, the inquiry wrapped up evidence from the London fire brigade (LFB) before moving to hear testimony from the bereaved and survivors. This morning, they heard that the LFB’s operational database contained no plan of Grenfell Tower to aid firefighting tactics. Last week, they were met by a surprising display of institutional defensiveness from Dany Cotton, the LFB commissioner. Families listened in shock as Cotton told the inquiry she had no knowledge of serious international cladding fires before Grenfell. The LFB did not plan for a fire the size of Grenfell, or devise training for staff based on that possibility, she said, “in the same way as I would never design a training package for a space shuttle to land on the Shard”.Shown evidence of warnings – an internal presentation for fire brigade engineers on the threat from “tall building facades” dated July 2016 a letter from the LFB to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (RBKC) warning them of the risks from external facades after the Shepherd’s Court fire – Cotton accepted that the risk was on LFB’s radar nine months before the fire at Grenfell Tower. “I truly do not think it would have benefited anyone to have more detailed knowledge about cladding to respond to Grenfell, because it wouldn’t have enabled them to extinguish the fire,” she said.“To hear Dany Cotton say that she would not have done anything differently is heartbreaking and feels disrespectful to 72 people who lost their lives,” said Natasha Elcock of Grenfell United. “There were warnings from many previous high-rise fires with cladding on them. The risks should have been taken seriously. To not prepare for a repeat of Lakanal House and say chances are like a space ship on the Shard is flippant and disrespectful. If anything, her answers suggest a culture of complacency and focus on damage limitation.”The fire brigade did not wrap the building in combustible material. Firefighters will live with that night for the rest of their lives, and many are deeply traumatized. Over the past three months, the inquiry has repeatedly heard how firefighters risked their own lives to save others. It has heard of the building failures the cladding the unprecedented nature of the fire but also of communications systems that did not work failed rescue attempts slips of paper carried by runners residents saved by the quick thinking of officers who provided additional breathing sets (not in LFB policy) residents moved by firefighters from one flat to another and told that someone would come for them. It has heard that firefighters were not trained on cladding fires or evacuations, or on the reversal of stay put. It has heard of one officer, Norman Harrison, who told his bosses that stay put should be reversed, but was ignored.In his report, The Patronising Disposition of Unaccountable Power, the Right Rev James Jones makes important points about the treatment of the bereaved after a public tragedy. He speaks of a “culture of denial” in public authorities, the need for candour, and a willingness to accept criticism and learn from errors. These are all lessons from Hillsborough. Cotton’s defensiveness set a disturbing precedent for other public bodies and core participants yet to be called. It signals that survivors and families may have yet another battle on their hands – the battle for truth and accountability.“For this inquiry to have meaning,” said Deborah Coles , the director of Inquest, “it must establish the truth and perform its vital preventative role so that such needless loss of life is never repeated. To achieve this, all witnesses must be open, honest and candid. There must also be a willingness to acknowledge and learn from failings. Only through this can there be effective and meaningful change and the lives of those who died properly respected.”Truth, accountability and change. These are the elements of justice. As survivors prepare to give evidence on Wednesday, they know they have a long road ahead of them. While families campaign for change outside the inquiry, inside they face a similar battle. There have been legal wrangles over disclosure, a dry technical process that has alienated many families and diminished the goodwill created in the opening commemorations. The venue is inappropriate it’s nowhere near the local community and impossible for those juggling work with the school run, which means many do not feel able to participate fully. For some, the inquiry venue is also where they heard bad news. The authorities should note Jones’s points of learning on the need for effective participation and the treatment of the bereaved after a public tragedy. This is their inquiry. Their voices must be heard.The inquiry, and the police investigation, could lead to change, but the wheels of justice are slow and their destination is uncertain. For now, the real change seems to be taking place outside the inquiry processes, led by the families themselves, who are determined to ensure that their children are not still campaigning for change in 30 years’ time. They should not have to fight. On Monday, they made this country safer and showed that their voices will be heard. The government seems to be listening. The inquiry – and those in public office called to give evidence – must listen too.As Elcock said: “We want Grenfell to be remembered not just for the trauma we went through but for the change that comes next. We hope this is the start of that change.”• Seraphima Kennedy is a writer and academic researcher and a former neighbourhood officer at Kensington \u0026amp Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26a29fb9e798716c7b705fad95cbcc832b996826/401_585_3427_2058/master/3427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff4f278200640216a39d2dcea9525ec","title":"remains of real wolf hall discovered by archaeologists hilary mantel novel","story":"The Tudor home of the Seymour family, setting of Hilary Mantel’s books, has been discovered in the grounds of a later manor in WiltshireThe Wolf Hall made famous by Hilary Mantel’s historical novels, has been unearthed, 500 years after it was razed to the ground.The magnificent home of the Seymour family, where the Tudor king Henry VIII first showed an interest in his third wife, Jane Seymour, fell into ruin 40 years after it was built. Over time it became unclear where the house was located or what it looked like.Now original features of the 16th-century property have been uncovered by archaeologists and historians, who have proved its location. The discoveries were made in the grounds of the much later built Wolf Hall Manor that remains today in Burbage, Wiltshire.The remarkable findings include a network of Tudor brick-built sewers and some of the foundations of two towers and several large rooms of the palatial home. Ornate tiles that are likely to have been walked on by Henry VIII were also dug up.Following Mantel’s award-winning books and the hit TV adaptation, the owners of Wolf Hall, who are direct descendants of the Seymours, have allowed archaeologists to explore the site for the first time. The team has spent 20 months on the project.Sir John Seymour, Jane’s father, was warden of the royal hunting forest of Savernake, and the Tudor Wolf Hall was built in the early 1530s with a loan from King Henry, and was brokered by Thomas Cromwell, of £2,400 (about £1m in today’s currency). The house was rapidly built in time for Henry’s visit in 1535 with his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Historians believe it was during this visit that Henry first noticed Jane Seymour and began wooing her.Mantel’s Man Booker-winning novel Bring Up the Bodies starts with Henry’s visit to Wolf Hall in 1535, and Cromwell’s sharp eye for the king’s growing affection for Seymour. He describes families rushing to prepare for the king’s visit during the summer: “Every household strives to put its best show for the king, and we’ve seen some panic-stricken plastering these last weeks, some speedy stonework, as his hosts hurry to display the Tudor rose beside their own devices.”By 1571, Wolf Hall lay derelict. It was demolished in 1723. There is no surviving picture of the property as Henry would have seen it, but historians know from records it was a grand home with a king’s chamber, broad chamber, long gallery, gatehouse, armoury, halls, kitchens and eight gardens.Historian Graham Bathe, who led the dig, said: “I approached the family because I had been working on researching Savernake Forest for about 20 years and Wolf Hall is absolutely central to that research.“I thought the likelihood was that the Tudor house would be on top of the hill. We had this extensive set of tunnels, which we have now identified as Tudor sewers, to guide us a bit, and then it was trial and error.“Walk-through sewers were unknown until Henry VIII’s time and these would have been extremely prestigious – there’s 140 yards in total, it’s an extensive network.“The intention must have been to make it attractive for the king to visit and garner more favour. Nobody could have foreseen that the daughter of the household would marry the king.”The team have uncovered the base of a hexagonal tower, along with stonework featuring early chisel marks and pieces of tiles. “We’ve found lots of oyster shells and animal bones, relics of the feasts they would have had,” says Bathe. “We have records of the menus from Henry’s visits, so we have an idea of what they ate.”The archaeological team hopes to reconstruct what the original house would have looked like, but the project could take years.Meanwhile, the Binney family plan to organise visitor attractions and events in the future to help fund work to restore and repair the existing property.Dominic Binney said: “Before Hilary Mantel’s books and the BBC series we got maybe one visitor a year. Now we get lots of people all of the time. They have really put Wolf Hall on the map.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1218770aaafc387f65f28df37c970d6565e2e613/253_26_5084_3050/master/5084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f47d577dcbd76d05e2645994e02d8cf","title":"never return teach england refuge abroad","story":"An estimated 15,000 teachers are snapped up overseas each year, driven away by the stress in British schoolsThe English education system is broken, says Freya Odell, a state secondary school teacher with 18 years’ experience. This month, she followed in the footsteps of thousands of other talented, fed-up teachers and moved abroad – in her case, to St George’s British International School in Rome.“It wasn’t a difficult decision. My job in England took over my life. Over the past year, I had stopped laughing and smiling. I had lost all sense of who I am.”Despite being director of learning, literacy lead and director of English at her previous school, Odell, 38, had to teach 20 out of 30 lessons and mentor three new staff. “I had to get up at 4.30am to get everything done, returning home at 7pm and working for another hour before bed, as well as at weekends.” She offered to take a pay cut to reduce her teaching load, but was refused.In Italy, she has been allocated the same amount of teaching but none of the responsibilities – and she will teach a class of 16 children, instead of 34. “If St George’s will have me for ever, I will never return to teaching in England,” she says.As the new school year gets under way, an Education Policy Institute report has highlighted how the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers to stem the flow of experienced staff leaving the profession has led to a “severe shortage” in England’s schools.“There’s a toxic mix of factors, created by this government, that is making teachers decide they cannot teach in England in particular any more,” says Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union. “The low net pay of teachers means many cannot even afford rent. There is systemic overworking, with teachers routinely working 55 hours a week, and a vicious accountability system, which means teachers are not given the time and support to get better at what they do.” It reflects badly on the government, she says, that so many highly qualified teachers are going abroad. “It’s not that they don’t want to teach, it’s that they don’t want to teach in the context we’ve created in this country, and the government is responsible for that. We are haemorrhaging teachers, particularly at secondary school level.”Teaching timetables in the UK are similar to the OECD average. “But our teachers spend twice as long as other teachers in high-performing OECD countries preparing lessons, assessing and looking at data. It is that, combined with low pay, which is driving teachers away. The very measures the government has taken to police standards are decimating the numbers of teachers in the classroom and lowering educational standards.”Meanwhile, four in five British international school teachers say they are happy or very happy with their new jobs, according to the Cobis survey. “Other countries exercise much more trust in their teachers,” says Bousted. “They enable their teachers to concentrate on what’s important.”Over the next 10 years, it is expected that international schools will require up to 230,000 more teachers to meet staffing needs – 145,000 of them will be recruited from the UK, ISC Research predicts. If so, according to Schools Week, international schools could snap up more than half of all the UK’s trainee teachers over the next 10 years to meet their targets.According to Nick Gibb, the schools minister, more than 14,000 teachers returned to teaching last year, many of whom had been working abroad. “A period teaching in another country has always been an option which adds to a teacher’s experience,” he said.In Italy, Odell enjoys lower living costs and free lunches, so expects to be better off despite a lower salary. “I feel optimistic that I’ll develop as a teacher here while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.”She says: “We had very limited resources. If you have a child with significant behaviour challenges because of childhood trauma, you need access to a clinical psychologist. For example, there was a child we worked with tirelessly to keep in school, to keep him safe. He absolutely needed specialist support but children’s mental health services said they were taking only life-threatening cases.”The child was later excluded from junior school. “Despite government spouting off about the importance of early intervention, it wasn’t there. Due to this lack of resources, the needs of very young children at my school were not being met.”The job left her with high blood pressure and, like her colleagues, she suffered chronic stress and insomnia. “I feel like I’ve done my bit and I was not prepared to compromise my personal health.”With 23 years’ experience as a teacher, 12 as a head, she found it easy to get a job abroad, choosing Jeddah because the teaching profession seemed highly valued there. Now her earnings are tax-free, her transport to work is paid for, and she has a complementary two-bedroom flat. “It’s the equivalent of getting a six-figure salary in the UK.” She is not sure she will work in Britain again.Jenny Anderton (not her real name), 51, who taught at state primary schools in southern England for more than 10 years, says that in the UK she was “more of a social worker than a teacher”. She is now teaching in Seville. “I love teaching, but it was frustrating at my UK school – there was a lot of paperwork and meetings for the sake of meetings,” she says.The last straw came when a child who had severe emotional issues was excluded. “I had flagged up that he needed help. He was a child in crisis.” Instead of supporting him, the school involved the police when he bit another teacher. Anderton’s wages are £500 less a year but she is confident she will be better off because of the lower cost of living. “I’m looking forward to being appreciated, rather than having the whip cracked over me all the time, and enjoying my job again, rather than being comatose at the end of every half term. The focus in the UK on attainment, when social services is on the brink, is bonkers and exhausting. I’m not planning to ever go back.”“Teaching in the UK is a thankless task,” says Victoria Mitchell, 39, who has taught at state primary schools in Nottingham for 11 years. She took a job at an English language school in Puglia, Italy, this month. “In the UK we’re set unrealistic targets and, compared to when I started, there’s little support. Things just get swept under the carpet.”She left a previous school after she discovered a leader from the academy chain lurking in the corridor, monitoring her teaching through a window. “I felt I was constantly being watched.”Her GP advised her to get a new job and, along with 11 other experienced teachers at that school, she did. But her new school was equally stressful. “Everybody was still under immense pressure. I love teaching PE, music and art and am passionate about languages. But in the UK, the focus is entirely on maths and English.”After holidaying in Puglia, she decided to send her CV to all the language schools there and received three job offers. “I chose the one that seemed the best fit for me.”On her last day of the UK summer term a parent yelled in her face. “I drove home from my final ever day in a primary school in this country in tears.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25235de435e01b5a341a6e66edf0fabf40a92465/0_115_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b860559fd28b1b3c5043baf1920c9126","title":"ghesquieres sci fi silhouettes take flight for louis vuitton at paris show","story":"Neat jackets and A-line dresses grace Louvre courtyard catwalk as designer ‘obsessed with empowering women’ closes fashion week“Every piece that I designed for this collection, I asked the question: is it powerful for a woman to wear this? Does it give her strength?”You don’t get to be the designer who closes Paris fashion week without having something to contribute to the cultural conversation. Nicolas Ghesquière, whose collection for Louis Vuitton was staged on a catwalk in one of the elegant internal courtyards of the Louvre, said this show was “about my obsession with empowering women. In the last two months the question of what it means to be a woman has felt so important so, this time around, I wanted to make that the only criteria. There is no other narrative to this collection, no story. It’s just about dressing women to empower them.”If you have never been to one of Ghesquière’s catwalk shows for Louis Vuitton, try picturing what Coco Chanel might wear to a Star Wars convention, and you start to get the idea. Elite Parisienne travels to space is Ghesquière’s signature aesthetic. “It’s not an armour, it’s more like a shell. It’s architecture, it gives strength.” The silhouette is always neat, as if mindful of economy of space, although the travel theme that dominates the history of Louis Vuitton is more often than not abstract these days: where once it sold steamer trunks, the house now sells miniature suitcases barely larger than a passport, and clutch bags in the shape of spaceships.In May, parent company LVMH made the unusual step of announcing that Ghesquière, who arrived at Louis Vuitton on a five-year contract in 2013, had signed a new contract to stay as designer. Deals between designers and brands are generally done behind closed doors, so the move amounted to a very public statement of faith in Ghesquière’s vision for Vuitton, which amounts to a modernist, almost sci-fi, take on bourgeois-chic classic silhouettes. Neat jackets, A-line dresses, narrow trousers and fluid dresses are the keystones of a high-fashion look that in turn sprinkle stardust on a robust business in handbags and leather goods. Louis Vuitton is the world’s biggest luxury brand, generating almost 8bn euros in annual revenue, accounting for the bulk of LVMH profits. For it to be in safe hands is of paramount importance to its owners. The statement that accompanied Ghesquière’s re-signing credited him with “unprecedented” growth in Louis Vuitton womenswear. “He has established a strong, daring Louis Vuitton aesthetic imbued with the spirit of the house and his own sensibility,” said chairman Michael Burke. The appointment of Virgil Abloh to menswear designer of Louis Vuitton earlier this year was a throw of the dice by LVMH, who are betting on streetwear continuing to dominate men’s fashion. Ghesquière, by contrast, comes from a more traditional background. Backstage after the show, reporters debated the exact number of male models who had figured in the show – some thought it was two, others counted four. “Actually, you know what? They were all girls, even in the menswear,” said Ghesquière. “That was the point. There was a real ambiguity. Everyone thinks a woman dressed as man gives her power, but it’s more complex than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54085b8502aec472737d67284987cd2177adf83/0_0_1544_927/master/1544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5a43ac26e47f1dfde52c2460068d14f","title":"paris fashion week springsummer 2019 16 key shows in pictures","story":"From Dior’s modern dance performance and Maison Margiela’s gender-fluid show to the beach set at Chanel, the Observer’s fashion editors Jo Jones and Helen Seamons pick the highlights from the collections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6f014ac3e7a1faf30b0cb12a2a7fa74dbbeb5d0/320_0_2935_1762/master/2935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c23b0631b2d0efe00fa8c4ca219b62","title":"venom review tom hardy marvel spider man spin off","story":"As the reporter who fuses with an alien ‘symbiote’, Hardy stumbles in a film that is nowhere near the nimble excellence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe seriesCan Tom Hardy play comedy – intentionally? The question remains worryingly unanswered in this clumsy, monolithic and fantastically boring superhero movie-slash-entertainment-franchise-iteration. The supposedly massive final showdown is so anticlimactic and pointless that it was only when it was followed by Hardy ruminatively sipping coffee on a stoop and chatting that I realised… that was it. That was the big finish. Hardy himself has said that the film’s best 30-40 minutes have been cut. At least that makes this shorter than it would otherwise be.Venom is one of the Marvel characters still owned by the Sony corporation and not under the control of the legally separate Marvel Cinematic Universe, although it is still entitled to the statutory Stan Lee cameo. Venom was first glimpsed in Spider-Man 3 and this cumbersome movie – so different from the recent nimble, populous and often genuinely funny Marvel films – feels like something that should be facing off with Tobey Maguire.The idea is that an amorphous extra-terrestrial being, a slithery CGI jellyfishy creature known as a “symbiote”, has been recklessly imported to Earth by a visionary biotech baron: the Elon-Musk-y figure of Dr Carlton Drake, played by Riz Ahmed. He wears a sleek black fleece, initially zipped right up to the top but then progressively unzipped to help show how terribly stressed and ANGRY he is getting with his white-coated underlings who fail to carry out his crazy bidding.This grisly organism is kept in a super-secure facility (with others) it’s like The Shape of Water in some ways, only instead of having soulful bathroom sex with a sensitive young woman, the creature needs to merge parasitically with just any old human body to survive – and not only survive, but boost that human host’s normal bodily powers to extraordinary levels, with violence in mind.And this is where Hardy comes in, playing tough investigative reporter Eddie Brock whose weekly half-hour show takes down officialdom’s rancid time-servers. Eddie is dating smart lawyer Anne Weying - an outrageously boring and submissive role for poor Michelle Williams, who looks just as pained in that part as Kirsten Dunst did playing Mary Jane back in the day. But Eddie’s happy world is due to be rocked on so many fronts: chiefly in that the evil symbiote gets out, snakes its sinuous way into his body and turns Eddie into the twin-identity monster called Venom. Other symbiotes are due to get out as well and we are eventually forced to witness the tiresome and self-defeating spectacle of a “good” symbiote hybrid battling a separate “bad” symbiote hybrid, this cancelling the dramatic importance of the original contest: Eddie Brock getting invaded by that hideous organic entity.Hardy does an awful lot of very broad-comedy split personality acting once the symbiote is inside him. They squabble. “Hungry!” the symbiote will boom inside his head in a deep growly voice and Tom will immediately convulse into a: “Wha...? What was that..?” routine. He thrashes and lurches around the streets like Jerry Lewis’s The Nutty Professor. Desperate for live food, EddieVenom crashes into a restaurant and sploshes hungrily into the tank where the live lobsters are displayed.There are in fact one or two big gags, but no real sense of fun - not compared to something like Thor: Ragnarok. Director Ruben Fleischer, who made Zombieland and Gangster Squad, is uninspired. Venom is riddled with the poison of dullness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3105107a61691d306a8fe1c415e86d8360a12426/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00f678ae127f87abcb436945026377b3","title":"cheeseburger spring rolls are gluttonous hangover food and i instantly want more","story":"This takes a dish so perfect that dismantling it feels like making a collage out of the Birth of Venus. But the artery-clogging result is deliciousIt is hard to imagine the size of the night out that led to the invention of the cheeseburger spring roll. It must have produced a hangover so monstrous that neither a Chinese takeaway nor a dirty burger alone could begin to solve it. A craving for junk and comfort so intense that someone must have deemed the burger’s bread – the bread! – too healthy, and conjured up an acceptable way to deep fry it instead.Whichever brave soul suffered for the concept, their work has not been in vain. At Manchester restaurant Solita, cheeseburger spring rolls are bestsellers (and as a place that has been known to put deep-fried lasagne burgers on the menu, they probably know what they are talking about when it comes to artery-clogging mashups). On the other side of the world, you can enjoy a platter of cheeseburger spring rolls at the Wharf hotel in Melbourne while sitting in your own private igloo, just to take the fusion element somewhere even more WTF. And at Disney World, the delicacy has earned itself a cult reputation, with some food bloggers celebrating when it returned to the Magic Kingdom’s menus.Quite where the idea came from is hard to trace, although it has been suggested that its roots may lie in post-second-world-war Japan, when US troops brought American staples to east Asia and they were absorbed into the country’s cuisine.I sample some at RedFarm, the famed New York dim sum spot that has just opened its first London restaurant. It is a place that likes to have fun with its food – one menu item consists of a sweet potato Pac-Man chasing four sumptuous prawn “ghost” dumplings, each one decorated with sesame seed eyes. Their cheeseburger spring roll, however, was apparently just the result of someone messing around in the kitchen while the restaurant prepared to open: “It was delicious, so we put it on the menu.”In some ways, the concept sounds unappealing and not one I would normally think to order. Perhaps it is the use of the word “cheeseburger”, a food item so perfectly judged that to dismantle it feels rather like making a collage out of the Birth of Venus. Ignore that term and there is no reason why a mixture of beef mince, onion and pickle wrapped in stringy cheese shouldn’t work as a spring-roll filling. RedFarm serves a pair of them (£10 as part of their dim sum menu) with a traditional burger sauce on the side for dipping.It is not so much more than the sum of its parts as exactly the sum of its parts – something delicious, combined with something else delicious, to make something that is roughly, by my mathematical calculations, twice as delicious. The crisp exterior works perfectly against the moist cheese and mince, while the pickles provide a satisfying acidic hit that cuts through the gluttony. I instantly want more, and this is after barely one cocktail – just imagine how good they could become as the night goes on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97b05bf6e971aa1e0033268db1cae3d2c9dd15b4/1069_1632_6614_3968/master/6614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b310ed608b3643b95026a20631873a81","title":"recipe felicity cloake perfect pasta pomodoro","story":"Felicity Cloake’s easy-to-follow recipe for the timeless Italian classicDescribed as “the national dish of Italy” by Christopher Boswell, executive chef of the Rome Sustainable Food Project and enjoyed, according to restaurateur Lucio Galletto, “from the small islands south of Sicily to the mountain villages perched high in the Alps”, pasta al pomodoro has a lot going for it.

So what’s the secret to success?As the tomato season is sadly over for another year – in the UK, at least – I’ve chosen to concentrate on recipes that use only tinned, rather than fresh, fruit (if you happen to live somewhere where decent fresh tomatoes are still easy to come by, I implore you to have a salad for me instead).Most of these recipes call for whole San Marzano tomatoes, a plum variety grown in Campania, southern Italy, whose sweet flavour and meaty flesh has been honoured by DOP status (Denominazione d’Origine Protetta) from the EU, meaning that all tomatoes sold here under the name must come from the Agro Sarnese-Nocerino region. San Marzanos are the Rolls-Royce of the food world: they’re the best, and everyone knows it.However, they are also pretty expensive. If you can’t get hold of them and have to make do with the own-label tomatoes from your local supermarket, or the more widely available Cirio variety, don’t worry too much. The difference is marginal once cooked into a sauce and it’s nothing that some judicious use of seasoning can’t make up for.Only one recipe calls for chopped, rather than whole, tomatoes. J Kenji López-Alt, on the Serious Eats website, reckons chopped tomatoes don’t break down properly during cooking, and I find them watery, so I don’t tend to use them, though, again, you can if that’s what you have to hand. On the subject of hands, Serious Eats also suggests using them to crush the tomatoes to create a chunkier texture than would be possible through mechanical means, while Katie and Giancarlo Caldesi deploy a potato masher. But for this particular purpose, I prefer a smoother sauce – it clings to the pasta better – and a stick blender is ideal for the job. Whizzing the finished sauce, rather than the tomatoes alone, as celebrated Italian food writer Anna Del Conte recommends for the Emilian recipe in her book Pasta, ensures a perfectly even result – no little lumps of veg to disrupt the perfect harmony of sauce and spaghetti.Del Conte adds a dollop of tomato puree for good measure, but my testers find her recipe a little rich. It turns out you can have too much of a good thing, as is also confirmed by the Serious Eats sauce, simmered low and slow in the oven for five to six hours, until it’s jammy and thick in the Italian-American “red sauce” style. Both are utterly delicious, but prove too much in such a simple dish – they cry out to be balanced by meat andor vegetables rather than pasta alone.On the cooking process, whichshould take about 40 minutes depending on your tomatoes, Rachel Roddy’s mother-in-law, Carmela, has some good advice in Roddy’s Two Kitchens: “The sauce should cook at a gentle simmer that has you peering under the pan to see if the flame has gone out, until a red burp on the surface reassures you that all is well.” The recipes I try fall into two camps: those seasoned with garlic and chilli, which feels like a more southern style (though I am willing to be corrected on that) and those that start with the traditional soffrito base of onion, celery and carrot, either sauteed until soft, as in Del Conte’s sauce and the Caldesis’ Roman version, or chucked straight in with everything else (and then, in López-Alt’s case, removed before serving). Certainly, as Boswell and Sarah Grueneberg’s sauces show, you can make a perfectly delicious sugo di pomodoro with nothing more than tomatoes, oil and garlic, but testers find them a little acidic when tasted side by side with the rest – nothing that couldn’t be solved with a pinch of sugar, of course (and if it’s good enough for Del Conte, it’s good enough for me). But if you’re willing to spend 10 more minutes at the stove, harnessing the sweetness of carrots and onions (preferably red, as Galletto recommends in The Art of Pasta) feels preferable. You can never have too many vegetables, after all.The aforementioned chilli is very much an optional extra: most of the veg-heavier recipes, with the exception of López-Alt’s, don’t include it, but I rather like a little heat in such a plain dish.Herbs are, in my opinion anyway, non-negotiable: peppery parsley proves marginally more popular with the simple garlic and chilli sauces, while sweeter basil is a clear winner with the others. López-Alt’s dried oregano is, as he notes, “an indispensable element of a good Italian-American red sauce”, but comes across as a bit strident in this simpler version.The same goes for Del Conte’s red wine, and the pork fat and meat stock in the Caldesis’ finto (or fake) meat sauce. Both would make excellent bases for other dishes, but are too rich for a simple pasta al pomodoro.Last, but certainly not least, for a smooth sauce such as this, the experts recommend spaghetti, though richer, thicker sauces such as Del Conte’s can take shorter shapes like macaroni or penne. I recommend taking a tip from Boswell and Grueneberg, and finishing the pasta in the sauce itself, allowing it to absorb some of the tomato flavour and thicken the sauce in the process. (This doesn’t mean you can’t prepare the sauce in advance, of course – it’s a useful thing to have in the fridge. Just reheat it and add the parboiled pasta as below.)Serve with extra basil and a generous dusting of grated parmesan, grana padano or pecorino, as suits your taste and budget – or forked straight from the pan as it is. It really is that good.4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus a little extra to serve2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 sprigs fresh basil, plus extra to serve320-400g spaghetti, depending on if it’s a first or main courseChop the carrot, celery and onion into very small cubes (a food processor is the easiest way to do this, but be careful not to reduce it to a mush – to avoid this, start with the carrot, then add the celery and onion once it’s roughly chopped).Heat the oil in a wide, deep, heavy-based pan (it needs to be big enough to hold the pasta, too) over a medium flame, then saute the vegetables until soft, but not brown. Stir in the garlic and chilli, if using, and cook for another minute or so.Roughly mash, chop or squish the tomatoes into the pan along with their juice and the basil, and bring to a simmer. Turn down the heat until only the odd bubble rises to the surface, and cook for about 40 minutes, until thick. Turn off the heat, remove the basil and discard, then whizz with a stick blender until smooth, bearing in mind it will be hot. Season to taste and bring back to a simmer.Cook the pasta in a large pan of boiling salted water for about six minutes, until bendy, but still chalky in the middle. Drain well, reserving a cup of the cooking water, and transfer to the pureed sauce. Stir in and cook for another six to eight minutes, or until done to your liking, tossing regularly to make sure it doesn’t stick and adding a splash of the reserved cooking water if the sauce gets too thick.Divide between bowls and serve with a dash of extra oil, a scattering of basil leaves and some grated cheese.• Pasta al pomodoro: is there a simpler, more delicious dish in the Italian repertoire, or do you prefer it with meat or extra veg? Are you a garlic and chilli or soffrito and red wine person, and what else should I do with my happy surplus of sugo di pomodoro?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15b1401dcacd14f400f7e02764fd799ee3730cef/0_153_4346_2608/master/4346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afc0c2c618facce7463dce6c7bde498e","title":"football association black coaches paul nevin sol campbell england football squad","story":"Brighton coach Paul Nevin will join Gareth Southgate’s England staff as part of the Football Association’s bid to increase the number of black and Asian coaches in English football.Nevin will work alongside Southgate for next month’s matches against the United States and Croatia as part of a Football Association initiative to place BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) coaches in all England squads.Former England defender Sol Campbell will work with Aidy Boothroyd’s England Under-21s team in November, while Terry Connor, former assistant boss at Ipswich, will join Boothroyd’s backroom team for this month’s games with Andorra and Scotland.“The FA can confirm a programme has been finalised to ensure BAME coaching placements across all England teams including the men’s seniors and under-21s,” the governing body has announced.The FA statement added: “This initiative to help to solve the challenge of under-representation of BAME coaches and improve the pipeline of future talent forms part of the FA’s new inclusion plan ‘In Pursuit of Progress’.

After the victory over Leicester City on the opening day of the season the midfielder said he feared a fine if he said certain things. He then stated United needed to “attack, attack, attack” at home following a draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers.Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, has also backed his player in public by tweeting his rejection of a claim by Paul Scholes, the former United midfielder, that there was a “lack of leaders” following the loss at Brighton last month.It is understood Mourinho believes United should have moved to close down the issue with Pogba by making it clear privately that the player and Raiola should not be allowed to run free and say whatever they wish because it is damaging to the team. The Portuguese also believes a public show of support would have helped.Pogba indicated after Tuesday’s 0-0 home draw with Valencia in the Champions League, which left Mourinho under pressure, that he had been banned from talking to the media. He said to reporters in the mixed zone: “I’ve been told I’m not allowed.”It is understood the result and performance against Valencia have not changed United’s position regarding Mourinho’s future and that they currently have no plans to remove him.The captain, Antonio Valencia, has apologised after he ‘liked’ an Instagram post from a fan which said that “recently Mourinho has made watching us a punishment” and “it’s time for Mourinho to go”.Valencia tweeted on Wednesday: “Yesterday, I liked a post on Instagram without reading the text that accompanied the picture. These are not my views and I apologise for this. I am fully supportive of the manager and my teammates.”Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Police have claimed they were not to blame for United’s traffic issues on Tuesday following criticism from Mourinho. United arrived late for the Valencia game, forcing the kick-off to be delayed by five minutes.Uefa has opened disciplinary proceedings against United over the “late team arrival” and “late kick-off”.Mourinho stated that United were “refused” an escort by GMP, which led to their journey from the Lowry Hotel taking 45 minutes longer than usual. But GMP insisted they were no longer obliged to provide that service for every match and that the club were aware of the change in policy.A statement from GMP said: “GMP has previously used police vehicles to accompany a team’s coach but after a review of our core policing responsibilities it was decided that we would no longer provide this service at every fixture. We consulted with the relevant football clubs over a period of months to allow them adequate time to plan ahead for their journeys to the stadium.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60478bdc559fa72fe4fe0ac09636f78df9f3cdb9/3_170_3910_2345/master/3910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5aa52b66a5176c83eda64e688ed09b3c","title":"manchester united hammered sturridges stunner and hampden rumble football weekly","story":"Max Rushden is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Mark Langdon to look back at the weekend’s action.

Stormy seas dotted with terrified faces. Lifeless bodies of children floating among the waves. And planes dropping bombs, down on to homes and on to people. Eyes that weep blood.The pencil scrawls were made by children who are part of a growing phenomenon in the Moria refugee camp in Lesbos, Greece. All have attempted suicide or serious self-harm since they came to this place.Approximately 3,000 minors live in the Moria camp, which Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) calls a giant open-air “mental asylum” owing to the overcrowding and dire sanitary conditions. Last Tuesday an adolescent attempted to hang himself from a pole. In August, a 10-year-old boy only just failed to take his own life.The camp, among hills dotted with olive trees a few kilometres from the island’s capital town of Mytilene, is home to 9,000 asylum seekers living in a centre designed to hold one third of that number. Migrants live in groups of up to 30 people, crammed into tents or metal containers situated just centimetres apart. Rubbish, scattered everywhere, makes the air almost unbreathable.Most come from war-torn countries like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. They arrive in dinghies from the Turkish towns of Ayvalik or Canakkale. According to aid agencies, the controversial deal brokered between Brussels and Ankara aimed at stopping the flow of migrants to Europe via Turkey, combined with the refusal on the part of European countries to take in asylum seekers arriving in Greece, have transformed Lesbos into an Alcatraz, leaving people imprisoned on the island with no way out.“Although the vast majority of migrants who arrive in Moria are traumatised, after having fled from violent conflicts in their home countries, conditions in the camp have exacerbated their trauma,” says Luca Fontana, field coordinator of MSF on the island. “After two years, some are still awaiting transferral, even if they know they could be deported to Turkey at a moment’s notice. I’ve worked in camps infested with Ebola in Sierra Leone and Guinea, but I guarantee you that this is the worst situation I’ve ever seen.”“Approximately 84 people share a single shower, and 72 people share a toilet,” said a report issued by the New York-based International Rescue Committee. “The sewage system is so strained that raw sewage has been known to reach the mattresses where children sleep.”Life in Moria is a daily battle for survival, with altercations common among the various ethnic groups over something as simple as a meal, and which occasionally degenerate into brawls. Not to mention, according to aid groups, the gang rapes of women attacked inside the camp’s toilets. Physicians and psychologists say that minors are also targeted in the sexual violence.To defend herself, 13-year-old Fatima sleeps with a knife under her pillow. Rape isn’t the only threat this Iraqi girl faces: the other is depression. On 2 September, Fatima swallowed tablets her mother used to take to alleviate the pain of the beatings her husband would unleash on her in Iraq. Fatima was saved by her three sisters, who found her convulsing in the middle of the container that the family shared with 25 other people.“It’s not the first time this has happened,” says Shamsa, Fatima’s mother. “Since we arrived in Moria, she has tried several times to take her life. My daughters have transformed since we’ve been here. They’ve become aggressive. We fled Iraq last May in search of peace, but here in Moria we found hell.”It’s not easy for the parents living in Moria to come to terms with the psychological pain of their children, when at the same time the mothers and fathers themselves have been victims of abuse and violence.“The parents in Moria fear that their children have suffered irreversible psychological damage,” says MSF Greece’s mental activity manager, Giovanna Bonvini. “They come here to the clinic because their children have stopped speaking or because they inflict wounds on themselves. In a short time, the parents begin to suffer the same depression as their children.”The MSF clinic is located just outside Moria. Owing to the stress and the inhumane conditions in the camp, MSF’s Lesbos initiative experiences the highest number of burnout victims among its staff working in aid clinics around the world. It is difficult to work when there is a shortage of physicians. The Greek health ministry provides only one for the 9,000 migrants in Moria.MSF, which has rejected EU funding to protest against the deal between Brussels and Turkey, organised a therapy session last June with dozens of children aged between six and 12 who had attempted suicide or were suffering from depression or self-harming. One phase of the therapy involved a storytelling activity in which kids tried to create a story with drawings and words. The children, mainly Afghan and Syrian, began drawing war scenes, shipwrecks, and eyes that dripped blood.The Regional Authority of the Northern Aegean has given Greece’s ministry of migration a 30-day ultimatum to clean up the camp. The first transfers of people to Athens have already begun. But with Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad ready to launch a final offensive against the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, if more Syrians flee the country, then the population of Moria could exceed 10,000 by winter. Inevitably, children will pay the highest price.The only moments of normalcy Moria’s children get come at a small play area 200m from the camp, built by Salam Aldeen, Iraqi-Danish founder of aid group Team Humanity. Thanks to a private donation, Aldeen has purchased inflatable castles and built a small football pitch. The children arrive en masse around 4pm to watch a cartoon on a large screen.“It’s the only place where they can be kids,” says Aldeen. “In here there are no fights, no altercations between Arabs and Kurds, no violence and no rape. In here they can feel at ease with the world and abandon themselves, at least for a few hours, in the thought that they are not prisoners in Moria.”Names have been changed to protect identities"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7beec031834f3d89ef628e010989b80321acc37/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfe609326f857e74585016f57e42dba9","title":"a parody of herself your reaction to mays conference speech","story":"A selection of your views shared as the prime minister delivered her conference speech in BirminghamMay has just about become a parody of herself.

It seems the only way to break the negotiations deadlock and avoid a no-deal that would cost May her job anyway, but is she desperate enough? crueroIt’s ludicrous to suggest that the Tories are a patriotic party. What patriot attacks their own people? What patriot inflicts huge suffering on their own people. What patriot inflicts what’s been described as “catastrophe” on some of their own people. What patriotic leader would happily allow people to sicken and die as a result of their policies, and when they saw that was happening just increase the severity of the effect? If a leader who does that is a patriot I’m the Queen of Sheba. jessthecripShouldn’t the speech be about successes of the past year and new policies to improve the nation over the next year? A speech which dithers around with proclamations of what May believes, her optimism about the future, her view of the sort of nation we should be, is a sure sign that the Tories have nothing whatsoever constructive to talk about. It’s a placeholder of a political speech. The only actual thing she’s mentioned of any note is fuel duty, which is a shiny bauble to distract from the otherwise vacuum of content. BillyWhile anyone can understand May being irritated by Johnson – he is, after all, a supremely irritating man – this waving of the “patriotism” flag is stupid. Basically calling anyone who doesn’t support her unpatriotic. We’ve had the Tories harking back to the spirit of Dunkirk let’s go back another 20 years and evoke the spirit of Nurse Edith Cavell, who said at her execution: “Patriotism is not enough, I must have no hatred or bitterness to anyone.” Doesn’t really apply to our Theresa, does it? susanjoyceJoking aside, as an EU national I genuinely find these war rhetorics, this whipping up of the British electorate into a frenzy as if the UK was at war with the EU, downright insulting. Particularly when given the fact that May herself immediately reached out to the EU for support over the whole Skripal thing. And immediately got that support, too. johan1974More scanners for detecting cancer, means more radiologists required to report them.

She entered the stage for her keynote speech at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham while swaying along to Abba’s Dancing Queen.The moves, which drew laughter from the audience in the hall, and more than a little mockery on social media, were combined with some opening references to the disastrous time she had delivering her conference speech last year. She apologised in advance if she coughed throughout this speech, saying she had been up all night superglueing the backdrop together – a reference to a sign that fell down behind her at conference last year.May’s dance moves were described on Twitter as “classy” by the Tory deputy chairman, James Cleverly, and as “totally brill” by the MP Michael Fabricant. Diane Abbott, who was mentioned in May’s speech as the prime minister addressed the issue of the level of abuse that MPs and their families received, was not so impressed. “Whoever thought that was a good idea should be sacked. I am looking at you Robbie Gibb,” in a reference to the Downing Street director of communications.In a week when May has received some tough messages from the EU over Brexit, her dancing at least seemed to win over one EU dignitary, as the Swedish ambassador to the UK offered her a bravo for her efforts.Observers on social media noted that May’s moves were a little robotic, which may not have been the intended impression.There were also concerns about the long-term effects for people listening to the Abba classic.The Labour MP Angela Rayner described the dance with the hashtag #cringe. And the SNP MP Joanna Cherry said it was “an affront to my favourite song”.May referenced her dancing again later in the speech, jokingly suggesting that some of the young people she met on her visit to South Africa might have been inspired to become “professional dancers” among other things.And it is not the first time she has been associated with the Swedish group’s classic – Dancing Queen was one of the songs May chose when she appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2014.Still, with Boris Johnson’s leadership ambitions in mind, Dancing Queen was probably a better choice of song for May than some other Abba hits – she carefully avoided giving the impression that she was facing her Waterloo, or sending out an SOS."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93060d47c6b22656c5e087165cd3f31cbfc6f692/0_26_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=335263fc3162af73d9a0aa82116bf84c","title":"theresa may conference speech ambasts labour as she calls for tory unity","story":"PM closes Conservative conference with speech attacking Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership • ‘Britain not afraid to leave EU with no deal’ - Conservative conference liveTheresa May launched a stinging attack on what she called the “Jeremy Corbyn party”, as she issued a strong call for Conservative unity on the final day of her party’s conference in Birmingham.Closing the gathering of party faithful, which has been marked by isions over Brexit, the prime minister claimed today’s Labour party had abandoned the principles of Gaitskell, Callaghan and Attlee, calling the recent antisemitism row a “national tragedy”.In a self-deprecating move, she appeared on stage dancing to Abba’s Dancing Queen. May then opened her speech by commemorating the centenary of the first world war, and urged her party to “recapture that spirit of common purpose”, that followed the conflict.“The lesson of that remarkable generation is clear – if we come together there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands,” she said.She sought to exploit isions in the Labour party, claiming she could see “the heirs of Hugh Gaitskell and Barbara Castle, Denis Healey and John Smith”, in today’s Labour party – but not on the frontbench.“Instead their faces stare blankly out from the rows behind, while another party occupies prime position: the Jeremy Corbyn party,” she said, claiming the Labour frontbench “rejects the common values that once bridged our political ide”.Corbyn was criticised repeatedly from the podium, underlining the fact that senior Conservatives now regard Labour as a serious electoral threat.In another striking riposte to Labour, May promised that 10 years after the banking crisis, “austerity is over”.“There must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past. No undoing all the progress of the last eight years. No taking Britain back to square one. But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this: we get it,” she said.“A decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over an that their hard work has paid off.”May set out a series of measures aimed at reforming free markets. “We cannot make the case of capitalism if ordinary working people have no chance of owning capital,” she said.In particular, highlighting what she has repeatedly called her “personal mission” to tackle the housing crisis, May announced she would scrap the cap on how much local authorities can borrow to build new social housing.“Solving the housing crisis is the biggest domestic policy challenge of our generation. It doesn’t make sense to stop councils from playing their part in solving it. So today I can announce that we are scrapping that cap,” she said. She highlighted the government’s response to the Salisbury nerve agent poisoning, and contrast it with Corbyn’s approach of demanding international action, sanctioned by the UN security council, on which Russia has a veto. “We cannot outsource our conscience to the Kremlin,” she said.May highlighted the government’s recent pledge to pour an extra £20bn into the NHS, and announced a new “cancer strategy”, aimed at improving early detection rates, as an indication of the Tories’ commitment to tackling domestic challenges after Brexit.And she bemoaned the toxic nature of public debate, citing murdered MP Jo Cox’s argument that political opponents have “more in common than ides us”.“Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies,” she said. “You don’t have to believe in a word Diane Abbott says to believe in her right to say it, free of abuse.”The former foreign secretary Boris Johnson drew an enthusiastic crowd to a rally in Birmingham on Tuesday, at which he claimed May’s Chequers plan was a “betrayal”, and urged his supporters to persuade her to abandon it.May hit back – without mentioning Johnson by name – insisting: “Leadership is doing what you believe to be right, and having the courage and determination to see it through, and that’s what I’ve been doing on Brexit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101562156bfa29bff00adba9920d7ff8de99ee21/35_11_1165_699/master/1165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db7308e26eb3b64b945e5eab61bd8650","title":"frances h arnold george p smith and gregory p winter win nobel prize in chemistry","story":"Briton and two Americans honoured for using evolutionary principles to develop proteins that have been used in new drugs and medical treatmentsThree scientists have won the Nobel prize in chemistry for their work in harnessing evolution to produce new enzymes and antibodies.British scientist Sir Gregory P Winter and Americans Frances H Arnold and George P Smith will share the 9m Swedish kronor (£770,000) prize, awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.The winners’ work has led to the development of new fuels and pharmaceuticals by making use of nature’s evolutionary processes themselves, leading to medical and environmental advances.“This is a field that was waiting for a Nobel prize,” said Paul Dalby, professor of biochemical engineering and biotechnology at University College London.Half of the prize goes to Arnold, from the California Institute of Technology, for her work on directing the evolution of enzymes – proteins that speed up chemical reactions. In a nutshell, Arnold introduced random genetic mutations into enzymes, and then looked to see what effect the mutations had. She then selected the cases where a particular mutation proved useful – for example allowing the enzyme to work in an environment, such as a solvent, it would otherwise not work in. The process can then be repeated, with further genetic mutations introduced into these selected enzymes.Arnold’s work has made it possible to cut out the use of many toxic catalysts, providing enzymes for all manner of fields including the development of biofuels and the production of pharmaceuticals.“Ultimately what it does it take natural evolution’s billion-year process or million-year process down into what is now probably less than a week,” he said.The other half of the award goes to Winter and Smith, for their work on “phage display of peptides and antibodies.” A phage is a virus that can infect bacteria and trick them into reproducing it. Smith, of the University of Missouri, found that it was possible to tinker with the genetic material of a phage to change the molecules stuck on its outside. He realised this could be handy: for example, if it was not known what protein a particular gene gave rise to, the gene could be put into a phage and the mystery protein would appear on the surface and could be identified. It also meant scientists could introduce a whole host of unknown genes to phages and the see if any of them gave rise to proteins they already knew about, allowing them to work out which genes were responsible for which proteins.The approach has also opened the door for scientists to engineer phages bearing specific proteins in order to explore how these might interact with particular targets. Winter’s work focused on genetically tweaking phages so that they produced antibodies on their surface – more specifically, the part of an antibody that attaches to other molecules. This meant he could screen them to find antibodies with the best interactions with other molecules or even cells..The result has been new drugs that have transformed medicine, offering therapies for diseases ranging from cancer to autoimmune conditions. Among them is adalimumab, an antibody-based drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease.“Nearly every modern therapy now is an antibody, based on using things like phage display,” said Dalby. “It is utterly pioneering, and if George Smith hadn’t done the phage display in the first place it would never have happened.”In an interview in 2016, Winter confessed to his first cancer patient that he had no idea if the antibody therapy would work. She said: “It only has to buy me a couple of months … my husband is dying and I want to be with him when he dies.” In fact, the therapy was hugely successful and “a massive tumour was blown away,” Winter said. His win brings the total number of Nobel prizes won by researchers at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge to 12.Arnold is only the fifth woman to be awarded the prize for chemistry. Upon being indicted into the US National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2004, she said: “25 years ago, it was considered the lunatic fringe. Scientists didn’t do that. Gentlemen didn’t do that. But since I’m an engineer and not a gentleman, I had no problem with that.”Smith paid tribute to his predecessors in the field. “Very few research breakthroughs are novel,” he told the Associated Press. “Virtually all of them build on what went on before. It’s happenstance. That was certainly the case with my work. Mine was an idea in a line of research that built very naturally on the lines of research that went before.”On Monday, James Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the 2018 medicine Nobel for their work on harnessing the immune system to combat cancer, and on Tuesday the physics prize was shared between Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland for their work on laser physics.The peace prize winner will be announced on Friday, followed by economics on Monday. The literature award is not being given this year after a scandal that resulted in a rape conviction earlier this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e344a3cb15a12dff0b4e553005cf1ae286f6b89/571_141_3501_2101/master/3501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad64cec9ac801b095d7720e1530ebe9","title":"andrew strauss steps down director england cricket","story":"• Strauss has been supporting wife, who has cancer• Andy Flower to continue in interim role until DecemberAndrew Strauss has stepped down from his position as director of England cricket after three and a half years in the role.The former England captain stepped away from day-to-day duties in the summer to support his wife, who has cancer, and says he needs more flexibility than the role offers in order to support his family.Strauss will now take a different role with the ECB, initially supporting the chief executive officer Tom Harrison in the process of recruiting a full-time successor.He has, though, concluded that his family’s needs mean he cannot guarantee the commitment required to lead the organisation in 2019 - when England host both a World Cup and an Ashes series.Andy Flower, who has covered the role for the last four months, will continue in his interim capacity until December with the intention of joining the Lions in India in January. A full-time appointment will be made before England’s West Indies tour in the New Year.“Next year is potentially the most important the game has had in this country, with the World Cup on home soil and a home Ashes series, and we have an incredible opportunity to do something special,” Strauss said. “It is vital that the director of cricket can give consistent guidance and support to England cricket through this period.“Taking time out this summer to support my wife and kids, as Ruth goes through treatment for cancer, has given me the chance to fully consider what’s right for England and what’s needed at home. The role in cricket requires total focus and commitment to deliver the best results, yet right now I need far more flexibility than could ever be possible in my position in order to support my family.“I will not be leaving the game completely – initially helping Tom to shape the role for my successor, then supporting a range of other ECB projects – but it’s important to see someone else in place for a crucial summer in 2019.“It has been hugely motivating and enjoyable to be working for the ECB and England Cricket. Before taking on this incredible role, I had little appreciation of all the selfless work that goes on across the ECB and throughout domestic cricket to ensure we have winning England teams and that the game, as a whole, keeps growing.“I have been fortunate to be at the ECB at a time when ground-breaking progress has been made, giving cricket a platform to evolve and inspire for years to come. I would like to express my gratitude to Tom, Colin Graves and the leadership team for their commitment and support in helping to drive English cricket forward.”Harrison said: “I know that I speak for everyone at the ECB when I say that we’re very sad to see Andrew step down from the role and we all wish him and his family the very best.“He deserves huge respect for the way he has managed his role, fully supported Ruth and their boys and calmly considered this decision.

Travel agents, too, can cancel those large-group-tours to Gallipoli. Because the Ryder Cup gave us conclusive proof that the ultimate team-bonding tool is already here, and its name is WhatsApp.The European team’s app-inspired love-in has removed all doubt. Even we on the outside could practically see the heart-eyed emojis fluttering between Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood. If Theresa May really wants to rally her cabinet behind her at the Tory Conference, she should surely be changing her profile pic to Justin Thomas in a Beat Europe T-shirt.Intriguingly, Rory McIlroy didn’t even have WhatsApp installed on his phone until the Monday before the tournament began. And here, I think, we can speculate on where it all went wrong for the Americans – they were probably still on Facebook Messenger. Jim Furyk’s attempts to motivate his men with big blue thumbs-ups were doomed from the start: no one likes getting those pop-up boxes in the corner of their browser. Just picture poor Tiger trying to Netflix and chill while Patrick Reed spammed Jordan Spieth with giant face stickers.Yes, just as Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, major sporting tournaments can now be won in the text fields of a free-to-use cross-platform messaging service. Only a few weeks ago, when England advanced to the 2019 Women’s World Cup finals, Phil Neville revealed how his extensive use of WhatsApp had forged a special bond with his footballers. “It means that every single minute of the day I know what players are doing,” said Neville. Which strongly suggests he’s one of those friends who gets you to turn on location-sharing on the pretext of meeting up at a busy mall, then hopes you’ll forget to ever switch it back off.“I know every part of their lives,” said Neville, adding more specifics than perhaps he should have. “I know about their animals – if they’ve got a dog I know its name. I know about their partners, I know if they go to the cinema – if they have an ice-cream I know about it.” It sounded creepy, but it seemed effective. Although you did wonder if Neville had really grasped the purpose of WhatsApp given that he had 30 ongoing chats, one for each squad member. “It’s the only way we can be in constant contact,” he said, so either he doesn’t understand what a text message is or his SIM plan is data-only.In professional sports, as in life, WhatsApp really has only two purposes: logistics and “bantz”. This was perfectly illustrated by Britain’s male gymnasts in the buildup to the last Olympics. When their group wasn’t dominated by Game of Thrones spoilers, Kristian Thomas explained to me then, it was largely men exchanging pictures of leotards, so that no one turned up at competition wearing the wrong one. The England rugby team has two different group chats precisely so Eddie Jones doesn’t have to contend with aubergine emojis and Mean Girls memes. That’s sensible because, let’s face it, one of those forwards is going to be that guy who always asks what the meet-up time is, because he can’t be bothered to scroll up and hasn’t yet discovered the search function.Membership of a WhatsApp group can mean everything to a sportsperson now. Chris Ashton, for instance, only discovered he was back in the running for international duty when he was added to the scheduling chat for the summer training camp. Unfortunately, since he earned himself a seven-week ban in a pre-season “friendly” that sounded anything but, one can only assume that the dreaded words “Chris Ashton has been removed from the group” are now haunting his sleep. “Some lads try to get in there early to remove themselves in a nice way,” Danny Care recently told an interviewer, “other lads try to hold on.” Insert gif of Martin Landau stepping on Cary Grant’s fingers, as he clings to the side of Mount Rushmore, here.In a world where our sporting heroes are distanced from us by ever increasing fame and fortune, it’s nice to imagine Roger Federer posting his videos to his Laver Cup team and getting embarrassed when he accidentally voice-calls Rafa. There is after all something universally humbling about the agonising wait while Novak is typing. Mike Tindall admitted not long ago that he was in “about 25,000” WhatsApp groups because he didn’t want to look rude by leaving.Turns out we all have the same struggles. And that, I’d argue, is just another example of how the WhatsApp group is a powerful team-building technology. Not only is it a truly democratic space where sportspeople can engage in all the locker room chat they want, it is also where they learn to put up with the bowler who shares every aspect of her day in unnecessary detail, to tolerate the full-back who wants you to admire his latte art, and even to graciously accommodate the awkward addition whose number no one recognises. Plus, if it fails, there’s always the splinter group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fb7962c145d879c55337592d6f31e0e4af64df5/0_119_3706_2224/master/3706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f3e530b18889e4ba2e45bb5d801e77","title":"max verstappen 21 f1 red bull russian grand prix","story":"Strong-willed, opinionated, uncompromising: Max Verstappen has always insisted that when it came to his driving only one person knew best – Max. Even under a barrage of criticism this season Verstappen vowed he would not change his style.A command performance at the last round in Russia was the latest in a series of races that seemed to justify his self-belief. Yet it also suggests the emergence of a new Verstappen, one that is establishing the broader credentials needed to win the world championship.He goes into this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix, where he has finished second for the last two years, on a roll. His race last week at Sochi, where he went from 19th to fifth, was a tour de force. With his Red Bull at the back because of grid penalties, the Dutchman scythed through the field. He was up to 13th by the end of lap one. By lap seven, when he passed Charles Leclerc for fifth, only the Ferraris and Mercedes remained in front.Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, likened the performance to that of a veteran. “It was one of the most outstanding first few laps I’ve seen for a long time,” he said. “I think he’s had some great races but this was an attacking race.”What stood out was the clinical precision with which Verstappen drove. His moves, particularly through turn 13 – no easy place to pass – were executed decisively and cleanly. This was a world away from the clumsy, poor judgment that blighted his opening races and led to calls for him to change his approach.That had reached a nadir with the crash in practice at Monaco which cost him a place in qualifying. Afterwards Horner joined those hoping he would learn from his mistakes. Verstappen tired of talking about it he would answer his critics on the track, he declared, and he did so in the following races.At the next round in Canada, he had a superb start from third and went wheel to wheel with Valtteri Bottas through the opening corners. It could have ended messily but wise heads prevailed and Verstappen kept it clean to be rewarded with a podium finish. He was then second in France and followed it with a win in Austria.The retirement of the two Mercedes was crucial at the Red Bull Ring but Verstappen put himself in position to take advantage after an opening lap battle with Kimi Raikkonen. It was hard racing, the pair banged wheels but both kept their heads and Verstappen came out in front. He won with a combination of honed aggression and patience.Before the race he believed he had already made his point in sticking to his guns. “I know I will always be right,” he told me. “Of course there will be difficult times and there will be more in the future but I know what I have to do in the car.”Further strong races seemed to vindicate him, including a fourth-place finish in Germany and third at Spa. Moreover he was consistently outpacing his teammate Daniel Ricciardo. Since Monaco he has out-qualified the Australian 10-0, a remarkable record against a talented driver.However it is Singapore that stands out. Verstappen’s race there demonstrated that despite the protestations something has actually changed behind the wheel. His qualifying lap was outstanding, just three-tenths from Lewis Hamilton who had put in the run of his career to take pole. Indeed Verstappen might have been closer but for a software-induced engine misfire.Starting from second he had to battle a determined Sebastian Vettel through Raffles Avenue. Verstappen fought him hard but, inches apart, finally ceded the pace into turn seven. It was a wise decision to play the percentages and fight on and proved advantageous. He stuck to the team’s plan and regained his place through the pit stops. Then, chasing Hamilton in the final third as they encountered traffic there was a sniff of a chance to go for the lead. He said afterwards he knew he had an opportunity but “didn’t want to take the risk”.It was the right call, he held on for second and it was probably his best race of the year, exemplified not by overconfident adventure but careful, considered and sophisticated racecraft. This is not to say he has changed his style but that he has learned to adapt and evaluate situations with greater effectiveness and act on them with a cool head. A trait shared by champions.Horner identified this after Russia, saying Verstappen has developed simply through growing up. “Since after the Monaco Grand Prix if you look at his season it has been very, very strong,” Horner said. “He’s driven some great races, I think he’s maturing.”Verstappen said before the 2017 season he was “always learning and nobody is a finished product”, an admission reiterated in Austria of his travails this year. “This has been character-building,” he said. “This was another step. Sometimes it is not enjoyable but sometimes you need it.”An ill-judged defensive block against Bottas at Monza was a reminder that he has not yet tamed his heart over his head but the indications are that, having celebrated his 21st birthday in Russia, Verstappen is beginning to come of age."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/727f240eb21f94c10f09f1574856fd5385efa74c/0_156_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e918fa27882e6a74cf76699481cdd9ea","title":"talking horses jockeys show jumping test olympia tony mccoy horse racing tips","story":"Tony McCoy will join the jockeys’ teams at the enormously popular Horse Show at Christmas.It’s a dangerous thing, supporting a loved one as they try something new and difficult. Tom Marquand learned that on Tuesday when he turned up to watch Hollie Doyle and other jockeys get a lesson in show jumping ahead of a competition this Christmas, and found himself getting roped into it.Marquand has now been pencilled into the ‘boys’ team of jockeys, led by Sir Anthony McCoy, that will ride at the enormously popular Olympia Horse Show on 21 December. They’ll take on a ‘girls’ team consisting of Doyle, Bryony Frost, Josephine Gordon, Lizzie Kelly and Bridget Andrews in an event called the Markel Champions Challenge in aid of the Injured Jockeys Fund.They don’t go as fast in show jumping, which may lead some jockeys and most punters to say: “Pffftt! How hard can it be? You get a nice, big saddle, your stirrup leathers can be as long as you like and no one will weigh you in advance. What an easy gig!”But the difficulties became clear very quickly as the girls team got their one and only practice session at the Surrey Hills stable of Pippa and William Funnell, equestrian legends both. Riding unfamiliar horses, loaned by IJF supporters, the jockeys soon found that steering the tight turns around the fences was a live issue. Lizzie Kelly’s mount demolished the second, while Doyle lost track of the twisting circuit at the first attempt. “They’re all used to going in a straight line,” observed one of their teachers.But the fearsome competitiveness that seems innate to all jockeys came bubbling up to the surface when a stopwatch was produced. Suddenly, the girls were lower in the saddle, twisting their heads round to find the next jump, driving their mounts out to meet it on an ambitious stride.Bridget Andrews, riding the most impressive of the horses on show, whizzed round in 46 seconds. Josie Gordon, aboard a mountainous beast, somehow cut enough corners to beat that by two seconds but at the expense of a pole down.Marquand, enjoying it all from the sidelines, probably won’t have time for a practice session if he does take part at Olympia and reckons he hasn’t jumped a fence in about six years. What could go wrong? The event is likely to be shown on the BBC, as in previous years, though TV details are yet to be announced.My focus for betting is on the novice handicap chase at Bangor in which Sergeant Brody (4.00) tackles fences for the first time and I can’t help thinking that 12-1 is a great price, albeit not as great as the 20-1 that was briefly available on Tuesday. This is the winner of an Irish point, running off a mark that derives from four poor efforts over hurdles.He’s a half-brother to The Package, which is sort of good news, since The Package won a Kim Muir. On the other hand, he was a frustrating beast who took a few goes to win over fences.Sergeant Brody is trained by the promising, likeable Sam Drinkwater, who had a bug in the yard at about this time last year but hopes for a smoother run this time and is clear that this horse should eventually prove better than his current mark of 112. There’s no guarantee that we’ll see proof of that today but the potential upside to Sergeant Brody is enormous.In the following handicap hurdle, I like Quids In (4.30), down to 4-1 from an opening 13-2 as he makes his debut for Donald McCain. The five-year-old has slipped 9lb since coming over from Ireland in 2016.At Salisbury, Summerghand (4.55) appeals at 5-1. Two recent defeats in much hotter races are easily forgiven. He was having a fine season before that and still looks fairly treated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a925268da61f0e409f3cc69aebe0ee05c20fe67/0_369_4201_2520/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89a8aec62078ec9cd8078d62e595222","title":"sketching review james graham london dickens wiltons music hall","story":"Wilton’s Music Hall, LondonGraham and eight previously unproduced writers present stories that capture the oddity and excess of the capital Inspired by Charles Dickens’ Sketches by Boz, James Graham has brought together eight previously unproduced writers to provide a dramatic mosaic of London life. The stories are interwoven rather than being separately staged and, while the result is a bit of a hodge-podge, the final impression is of a beautiful city at any moment on the point of collapse.Graham himself is a contributor as well as a dramaturg and, unsurprisingly, his pieces stand out. One, exploring the relationship between a mayoral speechwriter and the girl he has lost, is like a romcom with a savage bite: another, showing an ex-prisoner plotting to release the ravens in the Tower and bring the internet crashing down, offers a vision of apocalypse with a happy ending. What comes across most strongly, however, is the idea of London as a place of gregarious solitude and imminent danger. I was especially struck by Alan Gordon’s story of a fraught Falkirk-born drag-queen, by Himanshu Ojha’s account of a trawl through the sewers to discover the source of a severed hand and by Sumerah Srivastav’s chilling portrait of a second-hand shopkeeper who turns out to be a sex trafficker.I wished some stories, especially one about a revolution of the underpaid sparked by mutinous stage-doorkeepers, had been followed through and cohesion is hard to achieve with so many varied voices. Thomas Hescott’s production, however, keeps the action moving, and the designs by Ellan Parry and Daniel Denton (video) evoke everything from the upper reaches of Westminster Abbey to a suburban garden with a skeletal elegance.The five actors – Samuel James, Penny Layden, Nav Sidhu, Sean Michael Verey and Sophie Wu – also do a remarkable job of playing multiple characters often distinguished by nothing more than a change of hat. The show catches something of the oddity, excess and hidden terrors of modern London, but nothing is quite as potent as Dickens who, in the little-read Sketches by Boz, typically says of the city at daybreak on a summer morning that “the stillness of death is over the streets”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9119b8fb8737aa66bcc1f89606177aee202e606/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1589b79b3b880fb87532571c8efc8e97","title":"microsoft surface pro 6 surface laptop 2 surface studio 2","story":"Company also launches Surface Studio 2 PC, with all machines coming with improved processors and new colour optionsMicrosoft has launched new, faster versions of its popular Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and large Surface Studio PCs.The new models, announced in New York on Tuesday, continue Microsoft’s premium PC line, introducing Intel’s latest 8th-generation Core i5 and i7 processors to match competitors such as Apple’s MacBook Pros, Huawei’s MateBook X Pro and Dell’s XPS 13.The much anticipated update to support the modern USB-C port failed to materialise, despite Microsoft shipping the Surface Book 2 and Surface Go with USB-C this year.

From here cable cars climb almost 500 vertical metres over the Grand Motte glacier to the top station at 3,456 metres. It’s as “up there” as you get in terms of accessing the mountains with your trainers on – the second-highest cable car in France after the Aiguille de Midi in Chamonix.To reach base station, passengers take a funicular which tunnels 1,000 metres up through the mountain from the village of Val Claret to the Grande Motte glacial plateau. Once on the cable car, I was one of the first people to climb the small metal staircase onto the roof. I was so busy taking my camera out of my backpack that I didn’t notice we’d started moving. The new car is astonishingly quiet, and smooth. The chest-high glass barrier surrounding the deck acted as a windbreaker, and with the sun shining there was no need for a jacket.From our rooftop spot, we had 360-degree views of a sea of peaks: Grande Casse, with its imposing summit ridge and broad, steep runnelled face and, in the distance, Mont Blanc. Below us was an expanse of blue-grey ice and huge yawning crevasses. Anyone who has ridden a cable car before knows how opaque those ski-scratched Perspex windows can be. By contrast the views from this new cable car terrace are as clear as from a chairlift – although no chairlift I’m aware of flies you over swathes of glacial ice, dispatching the two-kilometre distance in a mere five minutes.It is this bird’s-eye view of the rugged landscape offered by the cable car terrace that Tignes is hoping will help attract more summer visitors to the area. Historically, the resort’s summer tourism has been dominated by its glacier skiing, but faced with glacial retreat and a shortening summerautumn ski season, it is keen to shift the emphasis to the surrounding ecology and fauna. This attraction, replacing the old 1975 cable car (which was notorious for breaking down), is stage one of a €17m investment which, over the next two years, will include the introduction of panoramic viewing platforms over the glacier and information boards detailing the unique ecosystem of the surrounding national park.“In the winter, I used to ask people, ‘do you know where you are skiing?’” says Eva Aliacar, Vanoise national park director. “And they would answer ‘Tignes’. And I would say ‘yes, but you are also in the Vanoise national park and Tignes-Champagny nature reserve, full of so much nature and beauty.”Eva points out an area behind us, which six pairs of majestic bearded vultures inhabit. The Vanoise is also home to 2,000 ibex – the largest population in France – along with chamois, marmots and golden eagles.At slightly lower altitudes, hikers can plan routes throughout the Vanoise, staying at refuges (tended mountain huts) along the way.As for the ski season, unfortunately the roof terrace will be closed in winter (when, along with the glacier, the full Tignes–Val d’Isère ski area covering 186 miles of piste is open). Picturing passengers trying to negotiate that narrow metal staircase wearing ski or snowboard boots in snowy, windy conditions, I think that’s probably for the best.As the cable car glided out of the top station and began its descent, I scanned the sky for a glimpse of those bearded vultures. And it occurred to me that the next time I’m in a cable car I’ll think: this is lovely, but it would be even better if I was standing on the roof. • The new Grande Motte cable car is in operation until 1 May 2019. It then reopens in mid-June until the end of August 2019. The roof terrace will be closed for autumnwinter, opening in the springsummer.

Plus 5 more autumn tripsI smell the harvest before we see it – a floral sweetness drifts in the autumn air, while a hint of wood smoke lingers on the nose. I’m on the Somerset Levels, that secret area of wetland bounded by the Mendips, the Quantocks and the Blackdown Hills, and heading to Pass Vale Farm at Burrow Hill, which is a place of pilgrimage for lovers of all things cider. And during September and October, the place is busy.The orchards that surround the farm bustle with machines that grab the trees and shake them until the apples drop. Tractors scoop the fallen fruit from the ground, and the yard is piled high with apples ready for the press. But Julian Temperley, doyen of British cider makers, finds time to stop and chat. The man is a pioneer who, after a gap of 300 years, reintroduced the distilling of cider brandy to England.But the Levels aren’t all about apples and cider. Basket weaving has been big here for millennia, and at Coates English Willow in Stoke St Gregory, I watch the process from raw material to finished product.I start with a tour of the workshops (adult £4.50, child £3). From log and shopping baskets to picnic hampers and tea trays, everything is handmade using centuries-old techniques. The warm smell of damp willow fills the air and is accompanied by the rhythmic sound of snipping and creaking.Footpaths lead from the workshops past newly processed willow rods (used to make baskets rigid) drying in the autumn sun, and down to fields where the willow is being grown. Planted in plots drained by the River Tone, they twitch and clack in the breeze, and are a haven for wildlife.The RSPB helps maintain the area as an internationally important habitat for wildlife of all kinds. The charity is also a partner in the Great Crane Project, which saw the reintroduction of cranes at a secret location on the Levels after an absence of 400 years. Brought over as eggs from Germany, the first birds were released in 2010, and now the population has risen to almost 100. The cranes are not easy to find – I took a walk along a stretch of the Parrett Trail, a 50-mile footpath that follows the River Parrett from its source in the hills around Chedington, Dorset, to Burnham-on-Sea – and although I’d been told by Ellie, our guide at Coates English Willow, that these magnificent metre-high birds were often seen in the meadows and fields I strolled through, I was unlucky.Before returning the bike, I called in at Muchelney pottery, where John Leach (grandson of Bernard Leach, the “father of British studio pottery”) makes his wood-fired pots (johnleachpottery). I bought a beautiful bowl that seemed to reflect the light of the surrounding landscape in its soft, orangey glaze, and then it was back to Langport through the glow of the afternoon autumn sun, and on to our hotel.I stayed at the Devonshire Arms (doubles from £90 B\u0026ampB) in Long Sutton. With views of the village green and a cracking dinner menu (I went for the pan roast hake cake, £16.95) it also serves Temperley’s cider brandy, which has to be the only way to toast the beauty of this hidden corner of England.Peter Benson’s novel The Levels is published by Alma Books (£7.19)For the literature lover, CalderdaleWith its rich literary heritage, Calderdale, in the south Pennines of West Yorkshire, is a bookworm’s dream.

It was envisioned by the screenwriter Kevin Laffan as a “26-episode play” about rural life in Yorkshire, but soon evolved into a soap that included storylines involving “sex, sin and sensationalism”.The soap has experimented with controversial storylines in recent years. In February, an episode involving an acid attack resulted in 200 complaints to Ofcom, after an audience of 7 million watched the violent pre-watershed scene. In 2016, there were 550 complaints after a dognapping plot was criticised for potentially inspiring copycat schemes.This year, The Mash Report marked International Women’s Day with a satirical take on the event, while Netflix released the second series of the feminist superhero show Jessica Jones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1670de2a93fc883e25d444385b52812a39886722/43_0_1457_874/master/1457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1dcd254291e40227c2fb82aab569da5c","title":"interactive episode black mirror sounds terrifying","story":"A Choose Your Own Adventure narrative will be all things to all people – and Netflix will be deluged with data about us allYou cowered to Playtest. You swooned to San Junipero. You’ve scratched your head at that one about the angry robot dogs. And now it’s time for the next step: controlling your own Black Mirror episode.Bloomberg reports that the next series of Black Mirror will have an interactive element. According to the report, one episode is being planned around a branching Choose Your Own Adventure narrative, allowing users to move the story forward at set points by clicking one of several on-screen options.This isn’t exactly new territory for Netflix – it has already experimented with the form with its Puss in Book special – but of all its original shows, Black Mirror seems the most sensible choice. Nobody wants an interactive House of Cards episode, for example, unless some of the options include “drift off and wander away” or “delete the last three series out of basic human decency”. But Black Mirror is forward-thinking and open-minded enough to allow such an experiment.Best of all, Black Mirror is the sort of series that nobody can fully agree on. Some people love the dark, grimy episodes that revel in a surface-level nihilism, for instance, and those of us who aren’t 13-year-old boys are more attracted to episodes such as San Junipero or Hang the DJ, where all the grisly future paranoia is replaced with something approaching recognisable humanity.An interactive episode has the potential to be all things to all people. Say it is an episode where a new type of toaster is invented that is powered by the like-clicks underneath a video of someone being maimed. If you’re a dark Black Mirror fan, you can choose a path where all the worst things happen and all the characters end up broken and bleeding, their bodies spelling out the word “WHY?” on a burning hilltop as every Radiohead song ever recorded plays simultaneously in the background. But if you’re an optimist, you can pick a path that allows the orphan to fall in love with the toaster inventor, and for them to break free of the oppressive system that created them both, before the inevitable twist ending reveals that they’re both actually molecules in a dying man’s fart cloud. See? Something for everyone.Better yet, whatever this episode turns out to be about, it will be the most watched episode of Black Mirror ever. Interactive narratives are always watched and rewatched over and over, as viewers try to discover every permutation of every story. The interactive film Tender Loving Care, for example, begged people to rewatch, not least because some of the options resulted in gratuitous nudity. And I’ve watched Puss in Book more times than I’d care to admit, even though it really isn’t very good at all.Something like Black Mirror would amplify this. Any given episode is already subject to countless recaps, but this would allow recappers to argue among themselves over which string of decisions made for the most compelling story. It might even bring about a whole new way of reviewing television, even though the world absolutely does not need that.And, of course, Netflix would be deluged with usable data. Every choice made by every user would signal a preference of storytelling that the platform can use to its advantage. It already knows the shows that certain ultra-specific demographics are most likely to watch, but an interactive Black Mirror will go one further. It will reveal the inidual story beats that each demographic favour at any given time in an episode.Soon it will be able to predict how every single episode of television we ever watch should go, and create an algorithm that writes our scripts for us, and we’ll all be trapped in a ceaseless hell of AI-derived storytelling. And, at that moment, Black Mirror will have eaten itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b6728af42c989105a8b82a484983eab12f186c6/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ead992eb3495c0bf35c39987bb76342","title":"men how to be kinder to yourself and feel more confident","story":"A growing ‘kindful movement’ is gathering pace, says author Caroline Millington, and men have much to gain from itYou’d have had to be trapped in the Love Island villa all summer with no access to the outside world to have missed the latest movement in self-care.It’s on T-shirts, phone covers, Instagram quotes, street art … I’ve even written an entire book about it. The buzzword? “Kind”.I know what you’re thinking – we’ve been told to be kind to each other for years. Everyone from Aristotle to Princess Diana has extolled its virtues as Mark Twain said: “Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”But the current iteration is different to the previous “pay it forward” variety. The new kindness is about putting yourself first – being “kindful”, in the same way you would be “mindful” in your day-to-day life. Why? Because if you’re not kind to yourself, how will you ever be kind to others?As with any new idea from the wellbeing world, some people have trouble getting on board. And I’ve noticed that kindfulness is a concept men especially can struggle with. After all, for decades guys were told to “man up” and encouraged to repress their feelings. Anything else was unmanly. It left generations unable to articulate their troubles at all.But with our mental health now a headline issue, 2018 feels like the tipping point – the moment when men say: “Enough is enough.”Matt Coyne, author of bestselling parenting guide Dummy: The Comedy and Chaos of Real-life Parenting, agrees. “Growing up, I was left in no doubt that a ‘real man’ should be tough, uncompromising and too busy eating red meat and reverse-parking efficiently to have feelings.“I’m not what anyone would describe as a ‘man’s man’. I like musicals, I struggle to grow a beard and I once cried watching Pitch Perfect 2. Being a stay-at-home dad isn’t for everyone, but I can definitely say that I feel fulfilled by it.”Coyne is an advocate of kindfulness in his own unique way. “I’m not someone who goes in for that whole standing in front of a mirror and shouting: ‘I’m a tiger!’” he says. “I’d feel like a bit of an idiot. But I constantly ask myself: ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’“Ditching parenting guilt has been a huge part of becoming a happier dad. It took me a while to work out that I will always be a bad parent – according to somebody. The greatest kindness parents can do themselves is realise that the only opinion that matters is your kid’s. As long as I’m the greatest dad to one person – my son – that’s good enough.”But while Coyne has happily shrugged off the stereotypes of what it means “to be a man”, many others are still struggling under the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with attempting to be a doting dad, ambitious career man, loyal partner or perfect provider.The ManKind Project was formed in 1998 so men could get together and talk about the fact that society’s expectations of men are “based on power, control and invincibility”. It sets out a clear mission statement: to allow a man to live with confidence, and purpose, and create a life without fear for himself and those around him. In short – to learn to be kind to themselves each day.Experts agree that a seemingly small thing, such as altering a negative internal monologue, can have a significant impact. Steve Clarke is a leading psychotherapist at Priory’s Life Works residential rehabilitation centre in Woking, Surrey. He says that negative self-talk can be so ingrained that it makes men feel – perversely – as though they’re on the right track. He explains: “Many men believe they can identify a self-critical voice as that of a once-critical parent, partner or coach who used criticism as a way to motivate or punish.“An increase in male body dysmorphia, poor physical health due to neglect among some, poor work-life balance and financial woes can all lead to a negative self-image,” Clarke adds.“It’s important to take a step back and recognise your value. Ask some people you respect to describe your best qualities. It’s good to be reminded of our strengths, and it helps to improve self-esteem.”According to Clarke, other acts of kindfulness that can go a long way to achieving that much-craved sense of contentment include taking 10 minutes out of the day to spend by yourself. “Use this time to remind yourself that you have the simple things in life – food in your belly, a roof over your head, money in your pocket, running water, love, compassion and good health. You’ll feel rich beyond all measure,” he says.So what other kindful acts can you bring into your life? How about a rethink of your relationship with your mobile phone? Even workaholic Simon Cowell has gone phone-free. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” the music mogul revealed this year. “I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused. It has been so good for my mental health. It really is good for you and it has absolutely made me happier.”Psychotherapist Padraig O’Morain, who has also written a book on kindfulness, believes that this form of self-care can transform anyone’s life for the better. “People who practise self-compassion are good at taking on challenges … it is often our own condemnation that we most fear,” he says.But how easy is it to apply kindfulness to your own life? Writer Chris Brock was experiencing crippling anxiety when he had a self-care epiphany.“I suffered with anxiety to the point where my head was constantly buzzing with negative thoughts: that I was a failure, I wasn’t good enough and maybe I’d be better off dead,” says Brock, who has just written a book about his experiences, Do the Thing, Have the Power: Overcome Self-Doubt and Build a Life You Love.“Someone said to me: ‘Thoughts aren’t fact’, but I struggled with this for about six months,” says Brock. “One day, those anxious voices were beating me up and I said out loud: ‘Shut up!’ It was at that moment that I realised that our thoughts are not us. And that led me on a road to meditation, mindfulness, and taking ownership of my life.”Brock put a programme of self-care into practice: drinking more water, starting a gratitude journal to focus on the positive in his life, and avoiding reading too much negative news.“This is a lifestyle change and something you need to practise every day,” he says. “I soon noticed the change in myself and became aware of how good I could feel.”“Negativity is just really hard work and energy-sapping so I really like the idea of kindfulness as a kind of counterbalance,” Coyne adds. “I really think there’s something to it for men.”Caroline Millington is author of Kindfulness (£10, Head of Zeus) out on 4 October 2018Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s treating yourself well or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that.

Journalist and podcaster  Jimi Famurewa reviews his journey through fashion faux pas to stylish gentWhen I think of the questionable fashion choices that litter my past – the time I sported two bumbags as a 10-year-old, the roomy skater jeans I liked to wear halfway down my backside, that summer when I really, really got into leather wrist cuffs and backpacker-ish beads – there is one ill-advised look that always sticks out. In fact, among some of my oldest friends, it has almost taken on a mythic quality: a folkloric garment shrouded in legend and whispered rumour.It would have been around the late 90s and, as a 16-year-old, I had successfully badgered my mum into getting me a pair of wincingly tight, metallic silver jeans from the Littlewoods catalogue. I looked, in my eyes, incredible. Bold. Vaguely futuristic. And it was only when I saw my kind friend Chris’s gaping, faintly horrified expression – having risked a split crotch by sprinting to catch the bus for a night out – that I thought something might be up. “Jesus,” he said, unable to mask his disbelief, “you look like the Tin Man.”Despite the evidence to the contrary in this story, I’ve always thought of myself as, mostly, quite an assured dresser. I was lucky enough to have two innately stylish older brothers who provided useful visual guidance, stacks of style-minded men’s magazines, plus whatever clothes I could sneakily liberate from their bedrooms.This fortune gave me the confidence, as a tween, to chafe ever-so-slightly against the “Ben Sherman and Reebok Classics” hegemony of the time. Having siblings who were willing to take risks with their look basically meant that (the odd clanger notwithstanding), I always understood that there was nothing wrong with experimenting a little bit.But there’s something about climbing to the figurative base camp of your mid-30s, as I have now, that makes you reappraise everything that has come before. Obviously these days, men’s fashion has never been a bigger or more varied industry – in June, Euromonitor was the latest market researcher to find that it is growing at a faster rate than women’s fashion. But, squinting warily at old pictures on Facebook, I can’t help but wonder if my unabashed interest in cultivating a personal style occasionally manifested as, well, misguided overconfidence.Trends and personal phases are partially to blame, of course. Midway through my teenage years I became a skateboarder and soon found myself weighed down by enormous hoodies, baseball caps and chunky scuffed-up trainers. This gave way to the UK garage years – tight Reiss T-shirts, tighter jeans and Patrick Cox loafers worn without socks – which slowly evolved into a more casual university look with looser, paint-spattered Diesel jeans, clunky statement belts and, at one point, a thoughtlessly grabbed vintage T-shirt that looked like it said “IRA” on the back.Grooming-wise, this was also the time that – save one turn-of-the-millennium night when I briefly twisted my hair into little Craig David-style buds – I started to tweak the neatly trimmed look I’d had since my double-bumbag days. As I emerged from university (and increasingly frequented sticky-floored indie club nights), I grew my hair out into a kind of knotted demi-fro that was heavily indebted to (read: shamelessly stolen from) Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke.It’s here that I think my life as something of a charity-shop peacock truly began. I lived in winklepickers, tweedy blazers, pocket squares, deliberately moth-eaten, plunge-neck T-shirts and jeans so skinny they often ripped if I overdid it on the dance floor. There was a cherished, patterned cravat that I’m pretty sure I found on the floor outside a house party.In isolation (and the context of the guitar-mad mid-noughties), there was nothing wrong with any of this. But it was just all too much. The volume was up way too high. In thrall to a certain scene or look, I had surrendered all subtlety and true iniduality in favour of a kind of box-ticking maximalism.So how did I shed those fussy adornments and arrive at the quieter, workwear-focused uniform I tend to employ today? Well, fatherhood – which brings with it clothes that are often accidentally accessorised with a smear of mashed-up food – has definitely made my taste more utilitarian and less prissy. Taking inspiration from well turned-out colleagues in their 40s – all turned-up selvedge denim (finished with tightly woven bands) and Red Wing boots – certainly helped. And, in swapping Albam chore jackets for All Saints blazers, I’m certainly broadly in line with the times.But I think, more than all that, it’s the hard-won self-knowledge that can only come with age. Rather than swinging wildly from one trend to the next, I’ve found a groove that suits and reflects me. I no longer feel vaguely deficient if my look doesn’t neatly conform with what’s on a particular shop mannequin or musician or off-duty footballer. My hair has morphed into a low-maintenance, ragged low-top and I let my beard grow out when the mood strikes me. I invest in quality key pieces – slouchy shirts, Breton-style tees, go-with-anything white trainers – rather than haphazardly splurging on youthful fast fashion wheezes.The clothes, as per the often misattributed Mark Twain quote, do not actually make the man. It’s the other way around. And as soon as you understand that, well, you might even be able to pull off a pair of shiny silver jeans.Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s finding your own style or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

The 35-year-old doesn’t understand why his grandfather chose it.In Turkey, many people only took on surnames in 1934 as part of “Turkicisation” reforms designed to create a unified nation state. Citizens were formally required to adopt last names, and many chose names that now seem ridiculous, such as Testicle, Jackal and Naked.But at the end of last year, Turks were pleasantly surprised by a government announcement that in a one-off window in 2018 the civil registry would cut red tape to make it easier for people to change misspelled or embarrassing names.Since January, more than 105,000 people have applied to get rid of names their ancestors chose that future generations went on to find inappropriate. As the end of the year approaches, the interior ministry says applications are flying in.While the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, was gifted his last name – “father of the Turks” – by parliament, not all of his countrymen took the opportunity to give themselves such noble monikers.Like Satılmış’ grandfather, other people with a sense of humour called themselves everything from animal names to Aptal (stupid), Donsuz (no underwear) and Tasak (testicle).Generations later, the trend persists. Rahmi is a name derived from the word for “merciful” but can also mean “womb”, meaning a prominent cleric in Istanbul today, Prof Rahmi Yaran, is jokily referred to as “Womb Slasher”.In the same city you can can also employ the services of a lawyer called Güven Kurtul. Güven means “trust”, while his surname means “to get rid of”.Changing a name in Turkey or even rectifying a birth certificate used to involve lengthy and expensive court procedures, but in the window that will close next year, the interior ministry is allowing people to apply directly to local civil registry offices instead.A total of 30,344 people have applied to change their first name, usually to correct misspellings – amending the woman’s name “Rabiye” to “Rabia” is the most popular request, followed by the male name “Ümit”, alternatively spelled “Ümüt”.The majority of requests – 75,248 to date – are to change odd family names.Satılmış (sold), along with Koyun (sheep), Çakal (jackal) and Deli (crazy), are the most common surnames to go, although requests have also been made to get rid of Çıplak (naked), Dana (calf), Kör (blind) and Ördek (duck).Satılmış is paying the civil registry office a visit on Friday. He has decided his new name will be Gokdeniz – which poetically translates as “sky sea”.No one else in his family is changing their name, he said, but they understand his decision. “I won’t miss my old name,” he said. “I would never give my own children a name like that.”Additional reporting by Gokce Saracoglu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6bd7f2c99d70e8f612ed5a65d76f5ff79287b0/0_135_3865_2320/master/3865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98f036424cbc752fbccc53dfc990911b","title":"thailand bay made famous by the beach closed indefinitely","story":"Visitors flocked to Maya Bay on Ko Phi Phi Leh island after it was in Leonardo DiCaprio filmOne of the world’s most popular beaches, made famous by the 2000 film The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is to be closed indefinitely to allow it to recover from the damage caused by millions of tourists.The golden sands and crystal blue water of Maya Bay, ringed by cliffs on Ko Phi Phi Leh island, has become one of Thailand’s most-visited tourist destinations since it shot to fame as the movie’s location.The small beach has sustained extensive environmental damage in recent years, receiving up to 5,000 tourists and 200 boats a day.Thai authorities announced they would be temporarily closing the bay from 1 June, but have now extended the planned four-month closure to at least a year, due to the extent of the destruction caused by the thousands of day-trippers.Songtam Suksawang, the director of the national parks department, said: “We have evaluated each month and found out that the ecological system was seriously destroyed from tourism of up to 5,000 people daily.“It’s very difficult to remedy and rehabilitate because its beach was completely destroyed as well the plants which cover it,” he said, adding that it was “impossible” for recovery to occur in the allotted time.Despite evidence of the mounting damage to Maya Bay, for years, Thai authorities had been reluctant to shut it, because the location generates about 400 million baht (£9.5m) in revenue a year.However, a royal gazette published on 1 October by Thailand’s department of national parks, wildlife and plant conservation announced the restrictions on tourism would not be lifted until the ecosystem “fully recovers to a normal situation”.The news will come as a relief to local environmental campaigners, who had said a four-month closure was not nearly enough. Coral only grows about half a centimetre a year, so it will take years for the reef to be fully restored.The Maya Bay park chief, Worapoj Lomlim, said the parks agency and others had already rehabilitated coral reefs in the bay by planting more than 1,000 corals, and would keep expanding the project.Countries across the region from the Philippines to Indonesia are waking up to the problems that can be caused by excessive tourism.In April, the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, announced a six-month closure of the Boracay beach resort, calling the destination a “cesspool”.Indonesia declared a “garbage emergency” last year along a stretch of the island of Bali, after coastal pollution was highlighted in a viral video that showed a er swimming through water full of rubbish."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Minister says 600 additional hospital beds will be delivered within three yearsMinister rejects FF claim department did not follow proper diplomatic protocolElderly dementia sufferer was prevented from leaving to go and live with her sonCandidate will visit every county and host events such as charity-sponsored walksResidents complain over motorists beeping horns at 2.30am in queues for doughnutsMore than a quarter of people staying in Cork Simon\u0026rsquos emergency shelter had history of state careIctu\u0026rsquos Sheila Nunan says protests will be \u0026lsquolarger and noisier\u0026rsquo as crisis hits \u0026lsquoboiling point\u0026rsquoVehicle was stopped by garda\u0026iacute at about 7pm on the M7 near Newbridge, Co KildareParty leader declines to say if she would vote to bring down British governmentEmployees of State-funded voluntary health and social services organisations strike agreementMinister for Sport sharply criticised by Battle Arena Ireland for intervention at weekendSl\u0026aacuteintecare Implementation Advisory Council features people from many backgroundsWoman dies in hospital after incident with truck on Bulfin Road on TuesdayAuthority director apologises after travel disruptions in Cork and Shannon airportsWatchdog says HSE must implement nine recommendations on database used for health planningArchbishop Diarmuid Martin says Pope Francis told Irish bishops not to repeat past clericalismPressing matters identified in KARE organisation which helps the intellectually disabledConsultants identify governance issues at Dublin facility"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650202.1538569532!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may calls for conversative unity on brexit","story":"Speaking at the Tory party conference, British PM Theresa May has ruled out the possibility of a second Brexit referendum, saying such an outcome would be a politician\u0027s vote.

Photograph:  Oli ScarffAFPGetty ImagesSplits over Brexit risk derailing the UK’s departure from the European Union entirely, Theresa May has warned her warring Conservative party.The prime minister, whose position has come under intense pressure following the publication of her Chequers blueprint for Brexit, told the Conservative Party conference: “We need to come together.”Dancing onto the stage in the city of Birmingham to ABBA’s Dancing Queen to a standing ovation, Ms May poked fun at herself after her dance moves were mocked on a trip to Africa and after last year’s conference when her speech was disrupted by a coughing fit, a stage intruder and a disintegrating set.She said that while she was working to reach agreement with Brussels, the “resilience and ingenuity” of the British people would be able to cope with a no-deal Brexit.Ms May’s strategy has come under fire from Brexiteers - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - who claim it will leave the UK tied too closely to EU rules without any say over them.He used a high-profile speech on Tuesday to call on Ms May to “chuck Chequers” and pursue a Canada-style free trade deal instead.But Ms May, who did not mention Mr Johnson by name, warned against causing ision.It was “no surprise we have had a range of different views expressed this week”, she said. “Even if we do not all agree on every part of this proposal, we need to come together.“Leadership is doing what you believe to be right, and having the courage and determination to see it through, and that’s what I’ve been doing on Brexit.”She warned Tories that the Labour Party would “accept any deal the EU chose to offer”.She also highlighted the prospect of a second referendum - the People’s Vote campaign - warning that another plebiscite would damage trust in politics.“A second referendum would be a politicians’ vote: politicians telling people they got it wrong the first time and should try again,” she said.Faced with those threats to Brexit, Ms May warned her critics: “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.”She said the Chequers plan was the only way to secure frictionless trade in goods while preserving the status of Northern Ireland within the UK.“No simple free trade agreement could achieve that, not even one that makes use of the very latest technology,” she said.The prime minister repeated her call for “respect” from the European Union and stressed that she would not accept “a deal at any cost”.She acknowledged that a no-deal Brexit, with tariffs and border checks, would be a “bad outcome” for both sides.“It would be tough at first, but the resilience and ingenuity of the British people would see us through,” she said.With no agreement with the EU over the orce or a future relationship, the last day of the conference marks the beginning of what some officials predict will be a frenzied couple of weeks of diplomacy between London and Brussels as the two sides try to secure a deal to end more than 40 years of partnership.Ms May and her team face weeks of difficult conversations with Brussels to win a deal, but she also faces challenges from inside her own party and from her partners in parliament, the Democratic Unionist Party.DUP leader Arlene Foster has used the conference to loudly set out her red lines for Brexit, repeating that she will not accept a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.“The red line is blood red,” she told the BBC.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Under current rules they must be paid a minimum salary of £30,000 - a figure Mr Javid hinted could be reviewed.Azad Azam, managing director of building firm\u0026nbspDPB Ltd in East London, and a member of the Federation of Master Builders, said he was stunned by the government’s stance, which currently classes all building trades as low-skilled.Robot bricklayers to be deployed in Brexit BritainThree in five UK firms say it\u0027s getting harder to find skilled staffFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsImmigrants face new \u0027British values test\u0027 to become UK citizensImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportImmigration has made the UK more productive and prosperousAbbott to dismiss ‘arbitrary’ immigration targets in major speech“We have not met the house building target for 12 years in this country and that’s with free movement of workers,” he said.Four in 10 of the staff he employs are from the EU, including many from Romania and Poland.\u0026nbsp“We were shocked when we heard the plans. I thought that, with housing supposedly being a top priority, there would be an exception for construction workers.”Mr Azam says he has a contract in the pipeline to build 300 houses near Walsall but if immigration is significantly reduced he simply will not be able to fulfil it.\u0026nbsp“It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.”A number of workers he employed from Romania have already had enough of the uncertainty over their future in the UK and have left to go and work in Spain.Finding British construction workers to replace them is hard, says Azam, whose father settled in the UK in the 1960s after moving here from Pakistan.“Work that many Asians were brought over here to do, like my dad in a steelworks in Sheffield - that kind of physical labour is now being done by EU migrants. It’s frowned upon by British workers. They don’t want to do it.”He advertised for an apprentice for four months in the UK and received just three applications. One young staff member he did take on left after just one day, saying, “It wasn’t for me.”It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.To make matters worse, the visa system soon to apply to all migrant workers under the government’s proposals is a “nightmare”, and will put firms off finding the skills they need, Azam says.He recently hired two highly specialised stonemasons from India. It took him more than six months to get the relevant permits, just for a three-month project.“If that is the system for all EU migrants as well it just won’t work.

Under current rules they must be paid a minimum salary of £30,000 - a figure Mr Javid hinted could be reviewed.Azad Azam, managing director of building firm\u0026nbspDPB Ltd in East London, and a member of the Federation of Master Builders, said he was stunned by the government’s stance, which currently classes all building trades as low-skilled.Robot bricklayers to be deployed in Brexit BritainThree in five UK firms say it\u0027s getting harder to find skilled staffFirms face Brexit skills shortage, forcing up wages in some sectorsImmigrants face new \u0027British values test\u0027 to become UK citizensImmigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major reportImmigration has made the UK more productive and prosperousAbbott to dismiss ‘arbitrary’ immigration targets in major speech“We have not met the house building target for 12 years in this country and that’s with free movement of workers,” he said.Four in 10 of the staff he employs are from the EU, including many from Romania and Poland.\u0026nbsp“We were shocked when we heard the plans. I thought that, with housing supposedly being a top priority, there would be an exception for construction workers.”Mr Azam says he has a contract in the pipeline to build 300 houses near Walsall but if immigration is significantly reduced he simply will not be able to fulfil it.\u0026nbsp“It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.”A number of workers he employed from Romania have already had enough of the uncertainty over their future in the UK and have left to go and work in Spain.Finding British construction workers to replace them is hard, says Azam, whose father settled in the UK in the 1960s after moving here from Pakistan.“Work that many Asians were brought over here to do, like my dad in a steelworks in Sheffield - that kind of physical labour is now being done by EU migrants. It’s frowned upon by British workers. They don’t want to do it.”He advertised for an apprentice for four months in the UK and received just three applications. One young staff member he did take on left after just one day, saying, “It wasn’t for me.”It will set us back 10 years. It is bad for every construction business in this country.To make matters worse, the visa system soon to apply to all migrant workers under the government’s proposals is a “nightmare”, and will put firms off finding the skills they need, Azam says.He recently hired two highly specialised stonemasons from India. It took him more than six months to get the relevant permits, just for a three-month project.“If that is the system for all EU migrants as well it just won’t work. By the time I apply they will have found work in other countries.”Mr Azam said that while the approach would mean the country had no chance of hitting its house-building target, he was more concerned about a drastic skills shortage in the health and social care - another area the government has pledged fix.The social care system is strained by funding cuts and an ageing population but the Nuffield Trust said the planned approach to immigration would cause further damage.Helen Buckingham, Nuffield Trust’s director of strategy, said social care providers are already turning away hundreds of thousands\u0026nbspof people who would once have been considered in need of help.\u0026nbsp“If we cut off lower paid EU workers without putting in enough money to make social care a sector people in the UK want to work in, more and more people who really need help with the everyday tasks of life will find nowhere to go,” she said.“Either we address the financial crisis that has pushed social care providers too far into the red to pay decent wages, or we continue to allow migration to fill these gaps after Brexit.”It is not only companies hiring low-skilled roles that are being hit by falling immigration.\u0026nbspTobi Schneidler, co-founder of Bouncepad, which supplies secure enclosures for iPads and tablets, said the lack of clarity around immigration had stifled hiring and that he found the government’s approach “extremely frustrating”.“Uncertainty for businesses is the most poisonous of conditions,” he said, adding that several EU citizens he knew had returned to their home countries because the “atmosphere has soured” since the referendum vote.His own experience of applying for British citizenship has also been time-consuming and costly.Despite having first moved to the UK from Germany 26 years ago, he had to pay £5,000 in legal fees, complete\u0026nbspan 80-page application form and pass the British citizenship test.“I’ve lived in the UK and paid taxes here for years, which must have been registered at HMRC, but I had to provide proof of a stable income, which entrepreneurs do not always have.\u0026nbspFemi Oluwole confronts a Brexiteer claiming the EU forces uncontrolled and harmful immigration on the United KingdomHospitality, which employs around 7 per cent of the UK workforce, is another area in which immigration policy is on a collision course with economic reality.The government has touted the sector as a potential winner from Brexit.

Issues were particularly affecting users in northern Europe, Australia and the west coast of the US, according to the outage-tracking website Down Detector. But that is probably because of time zones – in California, where Instagram is based, it was past midnight when the problems started.Facebook hack gets worse as company admits other apps were exposed tooThe problems come amid a difficult time for Instagram. The company\u0027s two founders left in recent days amid rumours that it disagreed with Facebook over how the company should be run.And after the Facebook hack was revealed over the weekend, it emerged that Instagram users and accounts might also have been caught up in it if they had used their Facebook log-in to create their Instagram account.Some of the accounts caught up in Facebook\u0027s hacks appear to be trading on the dark web, with cyber criminals able to buy access to people\u0027s accounts for just a few dollars, according to listings seen by\u0026nbspThe Independent.It\u0027s not thought that those issues have anything to do with the current outage, which is almost certainly simply a technical fault. Instagram goes down for time-to-time and can send major ripples across the internet, since more than a billion people use it each month.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance – by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.Applications developed through Solid may have a similar function and feel to familiar apps – such as chat apps,\u0026nbspvideo-sharing sites and music players –\u0026nbsphowever there is one key difference: All data that passes through them is under the control of the user.But while the decentralised platform aims to wrest power away from\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspgiants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, the effort will need to be huge to have any kind of impact.Facebook and Google now have direct influence over nearly three quarters of all internet traffic, thanks to the vast amounts of apps and services they own that\u0026nbspincludes YouTube, WhatsApp\u0026nbspand Instagram.\u0026nbspBerners-Lee, waves as he in introduced to the audience during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games (Getty Images)To realise this vision, Berners-Lee has founded a new company called Inrupt, which will provide the necessary infrastructure to support Solid.\u0026nbspHe will also be taking a sabbatical from MIT and his other projects in order to\u0026nbspdedicate his time to Solid and Inrupt.People want to have a web they can trust. People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do – without spying on them, he wrote.Apps that don\u0027t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance... It is going to take a lot of effort to build the new Solid platform and drive broad adoption but I think we have enough energy to take the world to a new tipping point.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On Twitter, she added: Trust me it\u0027s worth the wait.Appearing on TMZ, West himself confirmed the delay, saying that he hoped to record in Africa later in the year. “It’s just a full Ye album, and those five albums that I dropped earlier were like superhero rehabilitation,” he said, referring to the five albums he produced and released earlier in the year.ORIGINAL: Considering how sporadic and temperamental West’s current behaviour appears to be, there’s no way anyone can know for sure whether he intends on still releasing the album or scrapping it all together.Delaying the album inevitably would not be an unprecedented move for West take, for instance, Turbo Grafx 16, a record he\u0026nbsppromised to release in the summer of 2016. The album never materialised, with fans having to wait until summer 2018 for West’s\u0026nbspThe Life of Pablo follow-up –\u0026nbspthe seven-track album ye.However, Turbo Grafx 16 never had an exact release date, unlike Yandhi which also has an album cover – a clear MiniDisk with purple tape on it, reminicent of the 2013 album cover for Yeezus. Fans\u0026nbspand music critics have speculated that West has delayed the album so it doesn\u0027t\u0026nbspcompete with Lil Wayne’s new record\u0026nbspTha Carter V, although a Tweet from West contested\u0026nbspthis.The Independent has reached out to West’s representatives in a hope of getting a new release date.What have we heard of Yandhi so far?Whether any previously released tracks will actually appear on the album remains to be seen. However, West has released a couple of\u0026nbsptracks over the last few weeks, including the aforementioned Lil Pump collaboration “I Love It” and the track “XTCY”.During his Saturday Night Live appearance he also performed “We Got Love” with Teyana Taylor, a track initially meant for her album K.T.S.E,\u0026nbspwhich was produced by West and released earlier this year.There’s also a snippet of a track available on Instagram. The nearly minute-long clip came alongside a message reading: “Yandhi is releasing this Saturday”.Who will feature on Yandhi?A variety of other artists are rumoured to appear on the record, including regular collaborators Kid Cudi, 070 Shake, Ty Dolla Sign and Young Thug.Perhaps the most controversial collaborators expected to appear on the record include\u0026nbsp6ix9ine and XXXTenacion, who West says recorded vocals before his untimely death earlier this year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As it does, the meteoroids collide with Earth\u0027s atmosphere at 148,000mph and burn up in streaks of light that are visible across the night sky.That means that it happens at the same time ever year. They are most visible around 21 and 22 October, though they should be able to be spotted in the few days before and after that.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

So it\u0027s possible that you might spot part of the Orionids\u0026nbspany time from now until 7 November.Rare electric blue clouds captured on film by NasaAnd while 21 October marks the peak of the show, the Moon might mean you\u0027re more likely to see them the week before. Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible. Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky – wherever you\u0027d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.In keeping with their name, the meteor shower\u0026nbspwill be most visible from famous constellation of\u0026nbspOrion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want – and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They found that a mysterious planet of the kind previously suggested — a huge Super-Earth on a very wide orbit — fit with the way that their new find was moving through the solar system.The newly discovered object is called\u0026nbsp2015 TG387, is probably a small dwarf planet at just 300km across,\u0026nbspand is incredibly far away. It is currently lying\u0026nbspabout two and a half times further away from the Sun than Pluto is.There could be many more planets like Earth than we realisedIt often reaches much further away. Its orbit takes it\u0026nbspto about 2,300 AU — that is\u0026nbsp2,300 times as far away from the sun as we are, and vastly more than the already huge\u0026nbsp34 AU that the distant Pluto sits at.At that distance,\u0026nbsp2015 TG387\u0026nbspis one of the few known objects that is so far away that its orbit is not affected by even the giant planets in our solar system like Neptune and Jupiter.These so-called Inner Oort Cloud objects like 2015 TG387, 2012 VP113, and Sedna are isolated from most of the Solar System\u0027s known mass, which makes them immensely interesting, said Sheppard. They can be used as probes to understand what is happening at the edge of our Solar System.The object is one of the strangest things that astronomers have ever spotted within our own solar system. But there could be many more of them than we have ever realised, the researchers said.We think there could be thousands of small bodies like 2015 TG387 out on the Solar System\u0027s fringes, but their distance makes finding them very difficult, said the University of Hawaii\u0027s David Tholen. Currently we would only detect 2015 TG387 when it is near its closest approach to the Sun. For some 99 percent of its 40,000-year orbit, it would be too faint to see.The new discovery is being announced by\u0026nbspInternational Astronomical Union\u0027s Minor Planet Center. A paper with full details has been submitted to the\u0026nbspAstronomical Journal.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is the first time Yorke has scored a full feature film.The album also features the London Contemporary Orchestra and Choir, Noah Yorke on drums on “Volk” and “Has Ended,” and Pasha Mansurov on solo flute on “Suspirium.” The\u0026nbspSuspiria\u0026nbspsoundtrack will be released on 26 October via XL Recordings.Though he’s best known for his sun-dappled romance of last year, Call Me By Your Name,\u0026nbspGuadagnino hasn’t held back when it comes to his first foray into horror.Quentin Tarantino reduced to tears by new horror film SuspiriaFirst teaser for ‘absolutely brutal’ Suspiria remake Dakota Johnson claims making new horror film sent her to therapyThe central premise stays quite close to the original.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

NO-DEAL BREXIT READY: UK plans HUGE tax cuts to TURBO-CHARGE economy                Boris Johnson to SHAME Theresa May at Tory party conferenceMrs May will promise that, in the coming months as the Brexit negotiations reach a climax, the Tories will always act in the national interest and put the needs of hard-working people first.Signalling her desire to dominate the centre ground, the Prime Minister will accuse Labour under hard-Left Mr Corbyn of abandoning decency in political discourse.\u0026ldquoMillions of people who have never supported our party in the past are appalled by what Jeremy Corbyn has done to Labour, she will say.\u0026ldquoThey want to support a party that is decent, moderate and patriotic, one that puts the national interest first, delivers on the issues they care about and is comfortable with modern Britain in all its ersity.\u0026ldquoWe must show everyone in this country that we are that party a party that conserves the best of our inheritance but is not afraid of change, a party of patriotism but not nationalism a party that believes in business but is not afraid to hold businesses to account.She will say that the Conservative Party recognises the good that government can do but knows that government will never have all the answers and believes your success in life should not be defined by who you love, your faith, the colour of your skin, who your parents were, or where you were raised \u0026ndash but by your talent and hard work.Brexit news: Theresa May will issue a patriotic speech tomorrow (Image: )Mrs May will also signal her determination to stand up for the UK, saying the Tories are a party of Unionism, not just of four proud nations, but of all our people.And mocking Labour for the many not the few slogan, the Prime Minister will say that the Tories stand not for the few, not even for the many, but for everyone who is willing to work hard and do their best.Mrs May last night dismissed her warning from her business minister Claire Perry that a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic.She said: We are preparing for a no deal because we don\u0027t know what the outcome of the negotiations is going to be.We are all focused - as Claire is and the whole Government is - on making sure we get a good deal from the EU.If we go into a no-deal situation, there would I believe - and others have said this - be some short-term disruption.What is important is that Government puts in place measures that make sure we can make a success of Brexit, regardless of the deal we get from the EU.Brexit news: Theresa May preparing her showpiece Conservative Party Conference speech (Image: PA)And after details of her plan for post-Brexit border controls were unveiled at the conference, the Prime Minister insisted she was still committed to bringing net annual migration down to sustainable levels in the tens of thousands rather than hundreds of thousands.She added: It will take time to get to where we want to and - as I\u0027ve always said in the past in terms of dealing with immigration - you constantly have to be looking to make sure you\u0027ve got the rules right and people aren\u0027t abusing the system.So it will take time to get to those numbers but of course having the ability to bring control in relation to those people coming from the European Union will help in that process.In another interview, Mrs May rejected suggestions that the economic squeeze over the last decade was driving voters towards the hard-Left agenda of Mr Corbyn.No, what I did when I became Prime Minister was recognise the concerns of people in this country - concerns from some people that globalisation had left them behind, she said.Brexit news: Theresa May will deliver a showpiece speech tomorrow (Image: PA)In recognising those concerns and addressing some of those concerns, it\u0027s important that we also recognise that it\u0027s free markets, it\u0027s capitalism, it\u0027s open economies, trade around the world that have brought many of the great developments in human life.We also need to make sure that it works for everyone. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve said I\u0027m working for a country that works for everyone.She added that the Government will soon publish fresh proposals for solving the Brexit row over the Northern Irish border.We are continuing to work on that new offer and we will put a new offer before the European Commission, she said.She added: We are working on the proposal that we will put forward to the European Union on this so-called backstop.People use this phrase \u0027backstop\u0027. What it means is a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland. We committed to that in December in the joint report.I did that because people of Northern Ireland are part of the United Kingdom. I think it\u0027s important that we are able to deal with their needs and requirements as we do with people across the UK.This concept of introducing no changes in that regulatory environment without that consent of the people of Northern Ireland was in that December joint report.

So much so that we all went on holiday together this year.We’re all quite similar, we have all been married for a long time and we all share the same family values.It makes us a watertight team, although we each bring something dferent to the table.But, parking that for a moment, The Apprentice is also top-notch entertainment — this series more than ever. What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids  years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing  women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as .He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one caresyou have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £ to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PMshe did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for  years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already .% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain  Northern Ireland in .FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening.

But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many were found in village temples and played a part in local folklore.Mr Risbood told the BBC: We walked thousands of kilometres. People started sending photographs to us and we even enlisted schools in our efforts to find them. We made students ask their grandparents and other village eldersthey knew about any other engravings. This provided us with a lot of valuable information.The pair found petroglphs in and around  villages, but only about five of the communities were aware that the images existed.Tejas Garge, director of the Maharashtra state archaeology department, also told the BBC: We have not found any pictures of farming activities. But the images depict hunted animals and theres detailing of animal forms. So this man knew about animals and sea creatures. That indicates he was dependent on hunting for food.All kinds of animals, including sharks, whales and turtles feature in the carvings, while human figures and geometrical designs also appear.Since the remarkable discovery, the researchers have been working to document the thousands of ancient carvings and spur efforts to preserve them.The state government has designated  million rupees to study  of the petroglyphs in greater detail, according to the BBC."},{"url":null,"title":"car driving full tree branches stockport","story":"His windscreen was obstructed and he couldnt reach the gear stick as he drove down Heaton Moor Road, Stockport.Police called the move absolute madness.PC Andy Monaghan said hed never seen anything like it and he had risked seriously injuring someone.The man in his s, who has not been named, had been doing gardening work for an elderly couple on September  and was taking the leafy branches to the tip when he was stopped by police.He decided to fill the blue Toyota Corolla to the brim with branches so he would only have to make one trip.But he was asked to empty his car in order to drive safely and then had to make multiple journeys to the tip to throw the branches away.He must now attend court accused of driving offences.PC Monaghan said: He thought hed be fine, but the weather was heavy and he had limited control.I wasnt shocked because Ive previously worked in traffic [but] it was absolute madness."},{"url":null,"title":"mark bristow randgold hunting elephant leopard south africa","story":"Mark Bristow was photographed with several trophy kills including elephants, antelope, gazelle, a hippo, buffalo and a zebra taken in Africa.In promotional material dating from  to  he posed with a dead lion and leopard even though since  he has served on the conservation council of Panthera.The council  - dedicated to the welfare of wild cats - also includes actress Glenn Close as co-chairman, and actor Jeremy Irons.Bristow appears in promotional images on the website of Hunters  Guides Africa, a South Africa-based professional hunting tour operator.Mr Bristow, , who was born in South Africa but now lives in London, has been the CEO of mining giant Randgold since .The £bn company has a partnership with the Mali Elephant Project, which works to protect the worlds last remaining desert elephant herds.It is currently in the process of being bought by Canada’s Barrick  which will make it the world’s largest gold miner.Randgold told the : Legal, well-regulated hunting can and does deliver benefits for both wildle conservation and the livelihoods of indigenous communities living with wildle.Led by Mark Bristow, Randgold Resources has invested in a wide range of bioersity programmes in its host countries ... and is bringing together conservation professionals and scientists to develop a tailored method for the mining industry in Africa to restore the continent’s bioersity.However, the international wildle charity Born Free was far from impressed with the actions of Bristow - reported to be the longest serving FTSE  boss.Its president Will Travers said: “Mark Bristow is obviously fond of big numbers.

before changing direction and barrelling off towards Europe on Sunday.Previous reports of the strengthening storm said that Britain could expect fierce gales and torrential rain as the storm moved eastwards towards Europe, although its exact path was yet to be confirmed.Now weathermen have confirmed that the storm is heading our way, with charts showing the storms path curving menacingly up towards Britain.A Met Office Spokesman told The Sun Online: “Quite often by the time anything comes anywhere near the UK, all we’re left with is a bit of energy in the system rather than anything that vaguely resembles a hurricane.“But at the moment it’s far too early to say exactly where it will track and what stage it will be at as it crosses the Atlantic.“As it starts moving in our direction, we’ll get a better idea of how near to us what’s left will come, whether there’s anything that will affect our weather at all.“And it’s not likely to come in our direction till next week, probably mid-to late I would think, but it’s still a fairly fluid situation at the moment.Brian Gaze, director and forecaster for the Weather Outlook, told The Sun Online: Its too early to be certain about the impact of Storm Leslie on the UKs weather, but at the moment it looks like tracking to our northwest.That means a northwest to southeast split in the weather would be likely.In the north west of the UK there is the potential for it to turn very wet and windy.Areas farther south and east could remain dry, and possibly become very warm for the time of the year as tropical air embedded in the system crosses the UK.Some computer models show temperatures pushing up towards the mid Cs in the south east.However, it is too early to discount the chance of the wet and windy weather extending farther southeastwards.The enormous hurricane winds will blow over a huge  mile area, with less intense winds reaching as far as  milesEffects wont be felt in the UK until next week after Leslie has moved up towards the America.The National Hurricane Center in Miami has warned that large swells and rip tides could be le-threatening as the brutal storm closes in on the southeastern coast of the United States along with Bermuda and the Bahamas in the next few days.Before Leslies effects are felt in the UK, the south east is in for another warm spell today and for the next few days.The Met Office said: Given a good spell of sunshine we could see a C or C in London today, and tomorrow it will be similar.We could be looking at a C or C even on Thursday and Friday.The south east will also see the highest temperatures over the weekend.A weather front from northern Scotland will head down across the country on Thursday bringing some potentially heavy rain but winds will be mostly slow moving.Another front from the northwest will then descend to the southeast on Friday which could mean stronger downpours in northern England and Wales, as well as southern Scotland.The weekend is generally going to be cloudier and cooler, with rains following the weather fronts.It should dry up in the south east of England on Sunday but it will be a cold and bright day."},{"url":null,"title":"idiots attempt to dive into a swimming pool from a roof ends in a spectacular faceplant","story":"Video footage of the unidentied man leaves viewers wincing as he misses the water by inches, and his body slams the ground.It is not as yet known where or when the stomach-churning footage – shared on social media – was filmed, or what injuries he suffered.The video shows a half-naked man standing on the roof of a changing room, after climbing up a ladder.Pals appear unfazed as he lines himself up for the jump with one even talking casually on his mobile phone.But as the man walks down towards the gutter, with his head tipping forward, he raises his arms and plunges too soon.Arms flailing in the air, the wannabe er smashes through the guttering and lands on all fours while his head bounces on the hard concrete surrounding the swimming pool.The footage blurs as those watching and filming his painful stunt yell out and rush to help the man, who appears to be knocked out as a result.The six-second video has been widely shared on social media in recent days."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000438997366.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"638\" width=\"960","title":"theresa may dances onto stage for tory party conference speech","story":"The PM poked fun at her Maybot image as she got her groove on to Abbas Dancing Queen before appealing to the party to get behind her.And in a blast at Boris Johnson, Mrs May warned that anyone obsessed with getting the perfect Brexit risk leaving us tied to the EU forever.She also took a pop at the top Brexiteer over his f**k business jibe - vowing to back business instead.In the hour-long address, the PM:She admitted that the public needed to see that their hard work has paid off after struggling with cuts to public services in a bid to balance the countrys books.But in a blow to MPs who want to see her gone, Mrs May insisted she has a plan for the next year and beyond.The address received a massive standing ovation from activists, as husband Philip walked on stage and kissed her while ELOs Mr Blue Sky played over the PR.In her speech in Birmingham, the PM gave a spirited defence of her Chequers plan which has ided MPs and activists.She said: “We will not betray the result of the referendum, and we will never break up our country.“I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same.”The PM added that her plan would respect the referendum while minimising the economic dangers.She said: “It delivers on the referendum. It keeps fair with the British people. It is in the national interest.”Hitting out at hard Brexiteers such as Boris Johnson, the PM added: Those of us who do respect the result, whichever side of the question we stood on two years ago, need to come together now.If we dont -we all go off in dferent directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit - we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.In a second dig at Boris - who has overshadowed the conference by making his own alternative leadership pitch - Mrs May said Tories shouldnt be saying f**k business as he did earlier this year.She said: To all business - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.It has a single syllable. It is of Anglo Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter K. Back business!Mrs May vowed to bring an end to austerity after a decade-long financial squeeze, telling hard-pressed voters: “The end is in sight.”Praising the fall in the deficit, she added: “This is a historic achievement - but getting to this turning point wasn’t easy.“Public sector workers had their wages frozen, local services had to do more with less, and families felt the squeeze.“Fixing our finance was necessary - there must be noto the uncontrolled borrowing the past, no undoing all of the progress of the last eight years, no taking Britain back to square one.“But the British people need to know that the end is in sight. And our message to them must be this - we get it.”The PM revealed the Government will turn on the spending taps again next year once theyve finished the job of cutting a Brexit deal with Brussels.And she delivered a love letter to Britain, listing the countrys achievements and adding: Dont let anyone tell you we dont have what it takes.Mrs May also launched a blistering attack on Jeremy Corbyn - warning that Tories have a “duty” to keep him out of power.The PM said the Labour boss was making Jewish Brits feel unsafe in their own country and claimed the party has lost its moral backbone.Mrs May said: “The Jeremy Corbyn party rejects the common values that once bridged our political ide.”She added: What has befallen Labour is a national tragedy.She went on: What has it come to when Jewish families today seriously discuss where they should goJeremy Corby becomes Prime Minister That is what Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour party. It is our duty, in this Conservative party, to make sure he can never do it to our country.THERESA May tried to overcome last years disastrous conference speech by making a string of jokes about it.After she came on shimmying to Abbas Dancing Queen - mocking her cringey dance moves form a recent trip to Africa, she joked that some could even have been inspired to become professional dancers after seeing her moves. months ago Mrs May was forced to stop several times before while she tried to clear her throat.But laughed it off today, telling the audience: Youll have to excuse meI cough during this speech.The PM has been suffering with a snfle for the last few days, sparking fears of another spluttering disaster.And she quipped on the backdrop which came down last year: Ive been up all night super-gluing the backdrop.Mrs May also made a stinging joke about her ex-Cabinet colleague Boris Johnson, who gave a barn-storming speech to activists yesterday.A few months ago he caused uproar by reportedly uttering the words f**k business.But lashing back, Mrs May said today: And to all business - large and small - you may have heard that there is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you.It has a single syllable. It is of Anglo Saxon derivation. It ends in the letter K. Back business.After talking about her Housing Secretary James Brokenshire’s treatment and recovery from cancer, the PM revealed her own goddaughter died from the disease last year.She said: “Cancer can strike any of us at any time.“A few years ago my goddaughter was diagnosed with cancer.“She underwent treatment and it seemed to be working, then the cancer came back.“Last summer she sent me a text to tell me she was hoping to see another Christmas. But she didn’t make it.”Senior Tories hailed the PM’s speech - comparing it favourably to last year’s total meltdown.Jeremy Hunt said: “Congratulations Theresa May for a remarkable speech delivered with humour and passion.“Firmness of purpose, clarity and conviction - EU friends do not underestimate!”And Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell quipped on Twitter: “Waited  months for that #outthepark”.But Labour dismissed her speech as empty rhetoric - shadow minister Gavin Barwell said: Try telling local government across England there’s an end to austerity... deep cuts to our public services are continuing and they have Theresa May’s fingerprints all over them!And Lib Dem boss Vince Cable joked: “As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby. But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her.The PM said during her conference speech: “Something’s changed for the worse. Rigorous debate between political opponents is becoming more like a confrontation between enemies.“People who put themselves forward are becoming targets, their families as well.“We all saw the sickening pictures of a far-left extremist shouting abuse at Jacob Rees-Mogg’s children.“And it’s not only Conservatives who are facing abuse the first black woman ever to be elected to the House of Commons receives more racist and misogynist messages today than when she first stood over  years ago.“You don’t have to agree with a word Diane Abbott says to believe passionately in her right to say it free from threats and abuse.”Ms Abbott, the Shadow Home Secretary, welcomed her nice words but lashed out at the Tories for deliberately targeting her with their adverts during last years election.She tweeted: Some nice words from Tory leaders like Theresa May and Sajid Javid.

In the hall in Manchester it seemed that everything that could possibly go wrong did. When the Prime Minister was interrupted by a P prankster, you would have been forgiven for thinking that was dramatic enough. But after trying to recover her composure Mrs May succumbed to a painful coughing fit which left her audience waiting for what felt like hours. Limping through to the end she might have thought she was home and dry but the set had other ideas. As Tory members dutully applauded letters spelling out a crucial message behind Mrs May began to fall down. Here are  bombshell moments from last year to relive before Mrs May takes to the stage today. . A prankster handed over her P  In the middle of the Prime Ministers address, notorious prankster Lee Nelson got up on stage and handed her a mock P. At first Theresa May didnt skip a beat but she stopped as he was marched out by security to cries of “out! out! out!” from party faithful. Tory activists gave her a standing ovation in solidarity as she quipped: “I wanted to talk about someone I’d like to give a P to and that’s Jeremy Corbyn !” Speaking to journalists, Nelson, whose real name is Simon Brodkin, said: I gave a P to Theresa. I thought he [Boris Johnson] wanted me to hand it to her.  Boris asked me to. I don’t know why, you’ll have to ask him. Boris said in one of those corridor meetings Do me a favour and give Theresa this. He was seen being led out of the building in handcuffs, and was subjected to a body search by security officers. A security probe has now been launched. A senior No  source said: “Greater Manchester Police have arrested a man for a breach of the peace. “We expect that there will be a thorough investigation into whats happened.”Watch the moment prankster Lee Nelson hands P to Theresa May on stage during Tory party conference speech. She suffered a world-beating coughing fit  Theresa May struggled to complete her keynote speech after she was hit by a nasty coughing fit live on stage. The Prime Minister has been suffering from a heavy cold throughout the partys annual conference in Manchester. But it really kicked in halfway through her headline speech - forcing her to stop several times to cough, drink water and accept a cough sweet from Chancellor Philip Hammond. Members gave her a standing ovation as she was unable to continue saying the words “record numbers of jobs”. As Philip Hammond helped her out with a lozenge, the Prime Minister said: “I hope you notice that ladies and gentlemen, the Chancellor giving something away free!”  Given the coughing, she appeared to leave out a pertinent line in the speech. The written version provided to the media included the words: I rely on the NHS. I believe in the NHS. The Prime Minister skipped that part. Downing Street sources tried to shrug off the cough-filled performance by the Prime Minister. “The PM has got her conference cold a little early,” a senior source admitted. “But she is fine, since she’s been here she’s done  interviews and spoken at  receptions.” A source said she was “happy” and clapped back into the room by staff.  Theresa Mays speech to Conservative Party Conference was such an epic, multi-faceted disaster that even the backdrop fell apart before her eyes. In one final, brutal indignity, two letters fell off the backdrop on stage. The stage set originally bore the slogan Building a country that works for everyone. But the letter F gave up the ghost, falling to the floor in a desperate bid to escape the excruciating car-crash event. It was closely followed by the letter E.  By the end of her speech, it read: Building a country that works or everyon. Downing Street sources were at a loss to say how the letters fell off. Questions on whether there was glue austerity went unanswered.  Tory Amber Rudd appeared to angrily order Boris Johnson to give Theresa May a standing ovation during her disastrous car-crash of a conference speech. She struggled to complete the speech, beset by persistent coughing fits and a croaky voice. When the cabinet rose to their feet to applaud Mrs Mays waking nightmare, rival Boris Johnson needed a little encouragement. And the moment the Home Secretary appeared to angrily order him to stand up and clap was captured live on national TV.

The Prime Minister is giving a last throw of the dice with a fuel duty freeze costing almost poundbillion as she begs members to back her plan for leaving the EU. She must out-perform Boris Johnson who yesterday gatecrashed the Birmingham conference to declare her Chequers plan an outrage - and claim, Trump-like, that she could be prosecuted over it. This morning a Tory MP, James Duddridge, said he has no confidence in her and she should go. And in a conference day embarrassment, the Mirror has revealed an obscene night out by young Tories in Plymouth. At least she has a good chance of out-performing last years speech, when she collapsed into coughs, was handed a P and her slogan fell down. Theresa Mays speech begins at .am.

It was a deliberate nod to the embarrassing moves she flaunted on an official trip to Africa.  Mrs Mays speech last year was beset by a series of disasters - a prankster served her with a joke P, she suffered a coughing fit and the letters on the set behind her fell off as she ploughed on with her address.

Butyou were in Birmingham this morning, youve probably heard his voice. Hes the Tory Attorney General, and more importantly, the warm up act for Theresa Mays keynote speech to Conservative Party Conference. And to be honest, he didnt need a microphone. Most residents of the Midlands could have popped their heads out of an upstairs window and heard his booming, silken tones wafting on the wind. Prior to his speech this morning, Mr Cox was perhaps best known for being Westminsters most well paid MP.  But despite earning six figures on top of his MPs salary - and remembering to try to claim a pint of milk on expenses - he gave up his side gig as a high flying barrister to take the job of Attorney General, the Governments top lawyer. Quoting John Milton, he spoke optimistically about post-Brexit Britain, saying: Methinks I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and shaking her invincible locks. Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes at the full midday beam.  Almost as soon as he took to the stage, he was compared to a string of classical English actors, including Sir Ian McKellen, Brian Blessed and Patrick Stewart. And before he even sat down, bookmakers were giving odds on him being the next Prime Minister. Heres some of the best reactions to Geoffrey Coxs unexpectedly popular Tory conference speech.

Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of , where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesnt somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.Its day one, and theyve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, hes been impersonated by Phil Voldemort Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David Mine Are No Better Davis.We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasnt someone , and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.We all know whats happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isnt someone .So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories  . Project Oh Dear Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. Its a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who dont know what theyre doing. . Project You Cant Be Serious  Having toured the country in a bus promising to give our EU subscription to the NHS, the Tories have since said: a well still have to pay a subscription b it will be higher, without a rebatec by the way, well be cutting pound.bn off the NHSToday the spiritual leader of the Brextremists has suggested we spend our foreign aid budget on saving elephants, because they remind him of Beethovens Fth Symphony. Hang the education projects, stuff the small-scale charities who exist entirely because of foreign aid, and lets get all worked up about the  pence in every pound national profit that we spend on foreigners. Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what  . Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding  months after it burned  people alive, and onlyits on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.It also wont matteryou sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, oryou dont have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you wont want to live anyway. . Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesnt want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now,  months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.Patrick Kieltys dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend theres a border where there isnt one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across  miles of hedge that we cant police. Laugh  Youll die. . Project It All Onto Someone Else Presiding over economic chaos  Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That  Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, thats too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EUs crazy rules about bovine TB which isnt harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesnt kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccineonly we could be bothered.When someone says but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers! point out we still have to abide by EU ruleswe want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And dont, for heavens sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, youre looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.Youll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we havent dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything  that moved because, after Brexit, theyll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past  years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

Jordan was told he would develop early onset frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s Disease after inheriting a gene - which caused the degenerative conditions - from his mum. Last month, doctors gave the entrepreneur the crushing news he had a rare mutation of the MAPT gene, which causes the condition. And he has been warned his health will deteriorate as he gets older. He now plans to have his sperm screened for the gene so he and girlfriend Lucy Thomas, , can start a family before his symptoms develop.  Jordan also plans to tick travelling to Hawai, buying a house, and doing a skye off a bucket list. He said: “When I was told the diagnosis I was devastated. “We had been in the waiting area for what seemed like hours – it was only  minutes but it felt like an eternity. “As soon as I walked into the room I knew it wasn’t a positive result. “Nobody can prepare you for that. “If there are no advancements then I’ll have a shorter le than most. It’s like a death sentence. “Its very hard to explain. Were all dealt cards in le and I was just incredibly unlucky.  Jordan was given the news he had tested positive for the gene when he and sister Kennedy,  decided to get themselves checked after watching mum Geri deteriorate over a period of six years. He was finally given the results on September  after three gruelling months of consultations and blood tests. Jordan said he saw the full impact of the disease while caring for Geri, as he watched her lose the ability to talk, walk and eventually eat and breathe for herself. Her family first noticed something was wrong in , when she suddenly began acting out of character. However she was not diagnosed until  and sadly passed away in . Jordan said: “Mum was full of love and very much a people person. “No one had a bad word to say about her, she was very kind and lovely. “We’d noticed irregularities in her behaviour. I remember one Saturday she went to pick up Kennedy from school but it was a weekend. “Her character changed from being a loving woman and she became quite cold. “She seemed to lack compassion which was a huge change from when she’d covered us in love. “She slowly got stripped of her communication. She couldn’t talk a lot and then she began to lose her mobility and couldn’t go out alone. “As the disease progressed she lost the ability to walk and care for herself and for the last  months she was bedridden. It was heartwrenching.”  Jordan said that despite his initial shock, he and girlfriend Lucy have discussed plans for their future together and that he feels like his diagnosis will give him a unique perspective on le. They are considering having IVF when they decide to start a family as the process will allow doctors to screen his sperm for the dementia-carrying gene. Jordan said: “I feel like the diagnosis is actually a licence to live. “It’ll make me step back and appreciate the bigger picture. It’s going to allow me to make choices to live a fulfilled le. Lucy added: “We’ve decided that it’d be probably best to have children first and then get married. “We know it’s dferent to how most people would it do but it’ll give Jordan more time with his kids. “It’s hard to deal with knowing he won’t be there one day but it’s important to retain perspective. “We will have a le together despite everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle harry live duke","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry: LIVE as Duchess gives husband dreamy look of love during Sussex visitThe Duke and Duchess arrived in West Street to huge crowds before going on to shake hands and chat to royal fans - including the four-legged kindShareByAbigail OLearyUpdated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-chichester-first-official-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-harry-live-duke- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\" Meghan Markle and Prince Harry arrived in Chichester where they greeted huge crowds who had gathered throughout the morning - with the pair looking every bit in love more than four months after getting married.

The Coastguard was alerted and a military vessel helped rescue her, but she was pronounced dead at Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester.

Model Kira Mayer, , claimed she was victimised behind bars with many prisoners resenting her glamorous looks.Her chest was scalded “to the bone” in the alleged attack and months after the incident she still has a “red bleeding scar,” she said. She claims she got into a row with her cellmates who expected her as a “newcomer” to clean the cell and toilet. And the social-media star is shocked by le in prison in general - and says she wants to be fed oysters and have hotel service.  Speaking of the alleged attack, Mayer said: “Its been two months now, there was a deep burn to the bone. “And here they did not even give me any special medication to treat this. “I was just sent to the punishment box. “Im not a rebel, but I was strongly against the pressure on ‘newcomers . Despite reports that she suffered facial injuries the model revealed to a human rights monitor that the serious wound was to her chest. Human rights monitor and prison visitor Eva Merkacheva - also a prominent Russian journalist - wrote: “Incredibly, she manages to look the same behind bars as she looks in her Instagram. “Long hair, and huge doll-like eyelashes.”  The prisoner, used to tropical photoshoots and exotic holidays, said: “I’m always beautulthe media visit me.” And Mayer has not let the incident prevent her from making a series of extraordinary demands from warders in her Moscow detention centre ahead of her move to a penal colony for her  month sentence. But insistence on being served oysters and deliveries from top restaurants has not gone down well. Mayer said: When they brought me some strange porridge for breakfast, I asked: Can I have a hot croissant, orange fresh, mixed omelette and cheese  “I thought it was possible to order food here like in hotel. They laughed. “Next, they have such ugly metal bowls here. I cant eat from them, I’m afraid.” She said she only eats on plastic plates delivered by her family. “I am offering to introduce a paid service for delivery from restaurants so that they can bring oysters and fish, she said. “I want oysters so badly.”  She complained: “My bed is made of metal bars. “I asked for a normal one with an orthopaedic mattress, and they laughed at me again. It also turned out phones are not allowed here. I used to have three mobile phones and was on Instagram all the time. “I askedI could get even the most basic iPhone with internet but they laughed at me even more.” Mayer pleaded guilty to assaulting a traffic police officer who stopped her driving her Mercedes without a licence on the way to a manicure in Moscow. She offered a threesome to the officer and his colleaguethey ignored her motoring offence, according to reports citing law enforcement sources. The policemen “declined her offer and detained her”, it was reported.  From her cell she admitted to Merkacheva that she was “very afraid” of jail. Later she said she “told myself I had to continue living. “Now I almost dont cry,” said Mayer, ex-girlfriend of Russian pop-singer Alexey Vorobyov. “My regular le is gone. “I was on the way to my manicure - but ended up in a detention jail.” She said: “Only now do I realise I used to live like a princess. “I spent the whole summer behind bars, its sad. “I want to go to the Seychelles. “I do breathing exercises and it makes it better. “Half of my fellow inmates didnt like me straight away for my looks. “The other half were asking me all sorts of girly questions.”  She also blamed her female judge Katerina Kirichenko for her “harsh” sentence, claiming she “did not like me”. “In our country you can go to jail simply because you annoy someone,” she said. She admitted trying to hide the fact that she had been jailed “but it leaked out”. She said: “I realised that jail might be good and will increase my popularity.” Her latest ploy is to suggest a hair selling business to her jail governor.

While youngsters at Red Oak Primary School in Lowestoft, Suffolk, are practising their reading and arithmetic skills, they pedal away on the floor-mounted bikes to stay in shape.  The aim is to encourage them to lead a more active lestyle amid the countrys obesity crisis. It had been launched in a year three class for pupils aged seven and eight. Staff are so pleased with the outcome, its now being rolled out to a further  children in years one to six at the school. The exercisers have a digital display that shows exercise time duration, calorie consumption and revolutions per minute.  They were bought with some of the PE and sport premium funding and topped up from the school budget. The school has now placed an order to buy more pedals as they extend the programme to  other classes. PE co-ordinator and year three teacher Johnny Lee said: I had heard of schools in America using the pedal bikes during sedentary lessons, which led to improved levels of concentration after using the equipment and increasing activity throughout the day. We call it our active classroom. The desk pedals have seen the children cycle during their English, maths, ICT and French lessons to make them fitter and increase their daily physical activity.

The tropical storm is currently strengthening in the mid-Atlantic and is expected to develop to hurricane strength by tomorrow.  Storm Leslie has dramatically veered eastwards and is on course to hit northern Europe by the end of next week. The low-pressure front has the potential to bring powerful winds and stormy conditions as schools close for Autumn half-term. Met Office chief meteorologist Andy Page said: “Leslie will likely strengthen to a hurricane as it moves over warmer waters with large swells affecting Bermuda and east coast of the United States and the Caribbean.  “It is likely to gradually weaken after this and move eastwards across the north Atlantic. “Some models suggest Leslie will track south of the UK while others suggest it may move close to the UK by the end of next week.” A spokesman for the US National Hurricane Centre has warned the storm will drag a huge sea swell towards Bermuda and the Bahamas before changing direction on a new path towards northern Europe. He said: “Large swells generated by Leslie will continue to affect portions of the southeastern coast of the United States, Bermuda, the Bahamas, and most of the Greater and Lesser Antilles for another day or two. “These swells could cause le-threatening surf and rip currents. The UK is currently bracing for blustery conditions in central and northern Britain this weekend  Rain will be persistent in northern regions and Ireland from Thursday but it should remain dry and overcast for the rest of the country. It will also feel cooler from Friday and any sunshine will be in short supply.Downpours will soak many areas of England and Wales during Saturday andit will be quite windy as the stormy front moves across the country towards the North Sea before clearing overnight into Sunday.However, temperatures will continue to dip with highs struggling into the low teens C. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “A marked front will move over the north-west through Thursday, stalling over northern and central England and Wales during Friday and Saturday. “There will be some cloudy, wet and windy weather, especially on Saturday, associated with that front. “It will finally clear to the near-continent overnight Sunday, but turning much cooler in clearance.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mollie tibbetts man who led","story":"NewsMollie Tibbetts: Killer who told police where missing joggers body was claims not enough facts for defenceCristhian Rivera, , has been charged with first-degree murder after the sophmore students body was found in a corn fieldShareCommentsByElaine McCahill:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe legal team for Cristhian Rivera, , have said there are not enough facts to mount a defence \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe legal team for the man suspected of killing a jogger have claimed there are not enough facts to prepare a defence at his murder trial. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, , was charged with first-degree murder told police in Iowa, US, after telling where Mollie Tibbettss body hidden under corn stalks. The -year-old went missing on July  while out jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa. After more than a month of searching, investigators found her body in a rural farm field on August .  Now ABC reports Riveras lawyers have filed a Bill of Particulars in which they state the prosecution failed to provide guidance on the element of premeditation. In Iowa, the crime has to be premeditated in order for someone to be charged with first-degree murder. Rivera reportedly admitted to following Mollie while she was out jogging on July . He also allegedly said he got out of the car and started to jog alongside her but blacked out when she threatened to call . The farm worker claimed he then woke up inside his car which was parked at a rural intersection. Mollie was in the boot of the car but he claims he has no recollection of how she got there.  “The defendant cannot ascertain what acts he is charged with,” the motion read. “Without a bill of particulars, defendant cannot prepare his defense to the crime of murder in the st degree.” The motion also says that details of the “method or how the defendant perpetrated the alleged offense” have not been included in the trial information and that the defense lawyers weren’t provided access to crime scene details or the lab results. Authorities said Rivera admitted pursuing the -year-old jogger in his car on July , before parking, getting out of the vehicle and running after her. He reportedly told investigators that the student grabbed her phone and threatened to call cops as he ran alongside her - and he then panicked. The suspect apparently told investigators he came to at an intersection, before realising he had put the jogger in his car boot and opening it up.  He found the University of Iowa student inside the boot with blood on the side of her head, according to the document, written by a sherfs deputy. He then allegedly dragged her out of the vehicle, into a cornfield, before carrying her deeper into the field over his shoulder and putting her down. There, he covered her with corn stalks, the document adds. Rivera, a reported undocumented immigrant who entered the country ilegally, worked at Yarrabee Farms for around four years, where he reportedly gave his employers fake identity documents under a dferent name.

However one mum has proved theres a very dferent way to go about cooking a full English breakfast.Sonia Cheetham, , has come up with a simple and healthy way to give her family a treat before school, reports Liverpool Echo.Instead of throwing the mushrooms and bacon in a frying pan, she puts all her ingredients into a slow cooker. She says you could even cook scrambled eggs in a mug in the slow cooker the same way.The mum, from Little Fransham in Norfolk, first had the idea to do this in September, and when it worked out so successfully, she shared the hack on Facebook. Her post, in a group called Slow Cooker Wonders, has since gone viral with over , shares. Miss Cheetham said: “Using a slow cooker is so easy, Im type one diabetic so I dont like cooking with all that fat, and it gets everywhere as well so this saves your arms. The slow cooker is a much healthier way of doing things, dont add any oil or water to the pan, just a bit of butter to the mushrooms. I find that the meat, in particular the sausages, taste much better, theyre far softer and have a lot more flavour.

I just felt we needed to get the first win and I believe in them to go on now.“We enjoyed the weekend because it had been a long time coming.“It’s a relief to get the three points, I’m not going to lie but I’m really pleased for the guys because I’ve been talking for weeks about the belief I still have in them that they could get a result.“I thought we were well worth the three points.“I thought we absolutely dominated the first half, we didn’t change how we played – there’s no use in me saying I have belief in them and then changing how we play.“I thought it was the right way to go on Saturday and we dominated the ball, created chances and it was a great header from Boyle.”On more than one occasion this season Dundee have had the better of the overall play but were unable to take advantage by grabbing the lead.This time, though, with Preston loanee Boyle’s th minute header they did just that and, after seeing Accies pass up a number of chances, sealed victory in stoppage time as Madianga smashed the ball beyond Gary Woods to send the fans and the bench delirious.Neil added: “It was sheer joy. Football is about winning games and when you’re down sometimes you don’t get a lot of luck but we got a bit of luck on Saturday.“I’ve been hammering to them about getting into the lead but we’ve been conceding goals quickly and that belief that you can win games clearly reduces.“I just said to them that our gameplan is to get into the lead, not to just sit back and try to recover from - down.“However, only they can make that happen. Hamilton will have said, ‘get a goal against them and they’re dead’ but the players were well fired up on Saturday, I didn’t have to do anything.“When the goal goes in from Boyle, great delivery from Calvin Miller, you know you have something tangible to hang on to.“I’m so pleased, I don’t want to go overboard because it is only three points but it is a big three points for the club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these were csaba laszlos last words as dundee united boss","story":"Deep inside the bowels of Tannadice was where Csaba Laszlo carried out one of his last acts as Dundee United manager, speaking to the press after his team hit self destruct in losing - to Ross County on Saturday.Csaba was quizzed on where it all went wrong for him, not just on the day, but over the course of his near year-long reign as the sense he was a dead man walking filled the air.He was down and seemed defeated when laying out his defence and it was clear it was going to be the last time he spoke as the manager of Dundee United Football Club.Askedhe had considered resigning, he said: “I don’t think resigning is an option but it was a terrible result.“The team know that and we have to take the responsibility for it.“It wasn’t just one or two people # it’s the full team who have to take the responsibility.“I don’t think we are so bad going by results but we lost five goals at home.“Especially being so positive after the Falkirk game, we were % going into this dficult run.“We knew it wasn’t going to be easy but we showed real confidence and the injured players have slowly been coming back.“We wanted to avoid a result like Saturday – it’s not what we wished for.”Csaba did confirm that, as ever, he would speak with chairman Mike Martin which ultimately led to him being sacked on Sunday afternoon.The Hungarian also conceded he and the players had let the fans down with the display and recent struggles.He added: “I believe in my players and they feel the same after losing the game.“They don’t want to push the responsibility away – it’s not that easy. Saturday there was no evidence that we’re a good team.“The players let themselves down, too, not just me. We brought these players in to try to get promotion back to the Premiership.“Everybody is responsible after this defeat. It’s not easy to find clear words for it.“I don’t expect the fans to be happy after this defeat.”And Csaba’s sense that things were coming to a close were evident in the following comment.He admitted: “This is the worst I’ve felt as the manager of Dundee United, especially at home.“We didn’t have to concede those goals but I don’t want to point fingers at anybody. Everybody knows it was a bad performance.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb32e6a8c916-828x564.jpg ","title":"two names stand out as folk interested in dundee united managers job reaches double figures","story":"Two names stand out from the rest of the candidates to lead Dundee United on a permanent basis.The Tele revealed yesterday that caretaker boss Laurie Ellis is to be given the chance to show he’s the man to succeed Csaba Laszlo, who was sacked after Saturday#s - Tannadice drubbing by Ross County.However, should the board choose to make an external appointment ex-United pair Robbie Neilson and Jim McIntyre would be top of their list.The Tele understands expressions of interest in the post are already running well into double figures and that includes managers in employment.While the Tannadice board will consider all serious applications, however, they are believed to be keen to give caretaker boss Laurie Ellis the opportunity to prove his worth.This will be his second spell as caretaker boss. Last year he had two games in the hotseat after Ray McKinnon was sacked and led the team back to the top of the ision via impressive victories over eventual champions St Mirren and away to Dumbarton.At the time that prompted the board to urge him to apply for the job permanently but Ellis felt he lacked the experience to take on a club of United’s size.A year on that view might have changed and, was he to succeed Csaba, he would be a popular appointment in the dressing-room.The fact he’s a leading contender is further indication of how highly he is rated by his employers. While it was hoped Csaba would be the man to lead the team back to the Premiership, for some time now the former Raith Rovers stalwart has been viewed by many within Tannadice as a future boss.That said he does face competition from others with more experience and both Neilson and McIntyre will be interested.The pair could need convincing the Tangerines can succeed.Although he’s been out of a job since ending a dficult spell in England with MK Dons in January, Neilson’s stock north of the border remains high.As head coach of Hearts for two years from , he guided the Tynecastle outfit to promotion from a Championship that included hot favourites Rangers and Edinburgh rivals Hibs.On a tight budget, he then steered them to a top-six finish and Europa League qualication in their first season back in the Premiership.McIntyre has considerable experience from his time in charge at Dunfermline, Queen of the South and Ross County, where he lted the League Cup.He’s been out of a job since being sacked by the Staggies in September last year.While it’s known both are keen to get back in management, they’ll onlyin the right circumstances.In August, McIntyre turned down the offer to succeed Paul Hartley at Falkirk. He felt the budget there would not be sufficient to mount a promotion challenge.Likewise, earlier in the summer the vacant post at St Mirren was there for the taking for Neilson.After talks with the board, the -year-old decided their expectations were unrealistic and the job wasn’t for him."},{"url":null,"title":"vandals target the same vehicle on local road three times in six weeks","story":"Vandals have targeted the same vehicle parked on a local road three times in the past six weeks.Police Scotland has issued an appeal after the vehicle, parked in Fairport Road, suffered damage to the bodywork after being scratched.A statement said: #Anyone with any information should contact Police Scotland on , quoting CR   or speak to any police officers.#Alternativelyyou have any information about the incident you can contact the independent charity Crimestoppers % anonymously on    or via their Anonymous Online Form at crimestoppers-uk.org.#"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"its-time-to-get-booking-your-next-christmas-party-venue","story":"Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

I won it first time round at Cove and then again at Formartine.“But we’re not dwelling on the past, it would be good to get this one under the belt this early in the season.“They are happy memories the first time at Cove we beat Buckie and then at Formartine we beat Inverurie.“It’s always good to win cup finals, whoever you are playing for.

So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside  minutes after sloppy errors.

But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run.

Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued. Finally they were forced to seal off the area on public safety grounds, effectively banning longer electric trains.

Strictly Come Dancing has been watched by millions across the country since  with viewers voting for their favourite celebrity to be crowned winner. But before the television dance contest took over our Saturday night evening watch, viewers got their ballroom fix from the series Come Dancing, which later reformed becoming the follow-up show we know today as Strictly. Back when the show aired on and off on the BBC from  to , it featured professional contestants and not celebrities. Doonfoot’s Janet Stirling danced on the original Come Dancing series as a member of the West of Scotland formation team. Now the dance queen is displaying her gowns at a special showcase in the Carnegie Library in Ayr for fans of the series. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet relived her dancing days. She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural.

The budget for this current financial year has dipped into pound. million of reserves. Figures from March showed the council had pound. million of reserves stocked up. Auditors said using up reserves was sustainable in the short-term. However they warned the council only to reach for reserves within recommended levels. The finances were presented to the Audit and Governance Panel last Wednesday by Deloitte. Auditors said the council had strong budget setting and financial monitoring processes robust enough to achieve financial targets despite challenges. Independent councillor Alec Clark said: “Overall this report shows the good work done by the council.” He added: “I want to congratulate the team.”  He told the auditors the council is hampered in devising a long-term strategy as it relies on Scottish Government funding, which is dficult to predict. The finance strategy for  to  estimates a funding gap of between pound. million and pound. million. The report from Deloitte said: “It is imperative that detailed plans are developed to demonstrate that the required savings can be made, with the associated supporting infrastructure to be able to deliver on these.” Following a senior management reshuffle a fresh transformation plan is to be submitted at South Ayrshire. The meeting also heard one per cent of the entire budget should be subject to community engagement. The Scottish Government set a one per cent participatory budgeting target for .

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”.

cap on councils borrowing to fund new developments, with the aim of ldquobuilding the homes this country needs.In a speech designed to rally her party behind her following a conference riven by dferences over Brexit, Mrs May warned that squabbling over the details of EU withdrawal might mean ldquoending up with no Brexit at all.Standing firmly by the Chequers plan which was denounced by

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

We are not just a party to clean up a mess, we are the party to steer a course to a better future.To applause from activists, she said: ldquoSound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition.Because you made sacrices, there are better days ahead.So much for TMay claim her Tory values are security, freedom, opportunity.

A rare non-biting midge and several other species have since been discovered after surveys of the estate.In total, more than , species have now been recorded at the charityrsquos forest restoration site with at least  of these are priority species for conservation.These include unusual species such as the strawberry spider with several never having been recorded in the UK before, or were feared extinct in Scotland.Research also includes successfully encouraging aspen ndash a rare tree that rarely flowers or sets seeds in Scotland ndash to flower under controlled conditions, enabling it to produce seeds for propagation.Other pioneering trials include introducing a mix of spores from mushrooms when planting and growing selected trees and seedlings, to improve growth and resistance to drought, heat and pests.Doug Gilbert, Trees for Lersquos Operations Manager at Dundreggan said: ldquoThis first decade of rewilding at Dundreggan has been an inspiring success story. Thanks to hundreds of volunteers, , hectares of new forest are now growing from valley to summit.ldquoThese flourishing woodlands full of le are helping us save the Caledonian Forest ndash one of the worldrsquos magical forest habitats ndash from being lost forever. A renewed forest is being created that will benefit people and wildle for centuries to come.Other key findings during the charityrsquos recent survey season included two rare gnats whose larvae feed on fungi. One of theseis only known from four other UK sites.The otheris only known in the UK from a handful of Scottish sites and had not been seen since .The charity also found two parasitic wasps, for which there are very few Scottish records, and ndash for the first time in Scotland north of the River Tay ndash a pseudoscorpion called the knotty shining claw.A micro-moth, the small barred longhorn ndash only documented at three other locations in Scotland, and never before this far north ndash was also found during one of the volunteer Conservation Weeks.Other new species for the UK discovered on the estate have been three sawflies an aphid two aphid parasitoids, three fungus gnats and a mite.Dundreggan has also revealed the second-ever British record of a waxfly species, a golden horsefly only seen once before in Scotland since , and the juniper shieldbug, thought to be the first Highland record.Last weekend, the charityrsquos supporters and children from Invergarry Primary School attended a celebration event at the ,-acre bioersity hotspot to the west of Loch Ness.They visited Dundregganrsquos tree nursery, where they squashed rowan berries to release seeds, and also joined wildle tours to see the conservation in action."},{"url":null,"title":"philip-hammond-forecasts-post-brexit-dividend-once-deal-with-brussels-is-sealed","story":"The Chancellor in his keynote address told delegates: \"Im going to stick my neck out here today and make a prediction to you that when the Prime Minister gets a deal agreed there will be a boost to our economic growth.\"A deal idend, which we will share in line with our balanced approach between keeping taxes low, supporting public services, reducing the deficit, and investing in Britains future.\"He said that following the Labour Party conference of last week the nation faced a clear choice.\"A choice between the seductive simplicity of the brave new world of Corbyn and McDonnells populism where the narrative is all about easy answers, and our pragmatism, which is sceptical of ideologues, which starts with the real world we live in, and seeks to make it better and recognises that there are no shortcuts and no free-lunches on the road to a better Britain, that no wealth is created without work, no gain without sacrice, no reward without effort.\"Denouncing the Socialism espoused in Liverpool as a \"discredited ideology\" and branding Labour a \"backward-looking party, Mr Hammond told conference: \"We will not outbid Corbyn with short-term gimmicks that cause long-term damage. We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing, we will not promise the illusory utopia he offers because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears.\"He explained how no one should mistake the Conservative belief in evolution over revolution for a lack of passion or commitment to change, to a paucity of values or ideals.ldquoThroughout history, Conservative governments from Peel to Disraeli to Thatcher have delivered momentous change, drawing on our values that have stood the test of time.ldquoThe importance of family and community the strength of our nation, united by history, culture and identity standing strong as a force for good in the world the insight that economic freedom goes hand in hand with political freedom and, above all, the belief in the power of enterprise as the route to unleash talent and to improve lives.ldquoThat is why we back business, declared the Chancellor. ldquoWe back business as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society and as an essential expression of our values.ldquoSo just in case anyone, anywhere, was in any doubt at all, let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business.Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Hammond threatened internet giants with a new digital services tax to ensure they paid their fair share of the cost of public services.He stressed that, with international talks stalling, Britain was ready to go it alone with a levy on the tech companies.The measure formed part of a programme to \"regenerate capitalism\" which the Chancellor said was needed to tackle the challenges of the modern world and renew the appeal of the free market to a new generation.\"The best way to tax international companies is through international agreement,\" explained Mr Hammond.\"But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own,\" he declared.The Chancellor acknowledged that many voters felt \"left behind\" by economic change and feared they would fall further behind as new technologies like articial intelligence and driverless cars made their jobs obsolete.He warned that the Tories must persuade these people that the market system could work for them or see them fall for the \"seductive simplicities\" offered by Labour.In response, John McDonnell for Labour said: ldquoThe Chancellorrsquos speech confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory Party increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day le most people experience.The Shadow Chancellor added: ldquoThe Tories are bereft of any fresh ideas, forced to resort to a half-hearted filching of policies from others and desperately trying to revive long outdated slogans. As the Tories sink into a pit of bitter infighting, we mustnt allow them to take the country down with it."},{"url":null,"title":"margaret-taylor-forget-strikes-equal-pay-women-should-get-marching","story":"If you think that was in poor taste it is nothing compared to the metaphorical two fingers the party gave the SNP in Glasgow when, last year, it bequeathed the nationalists not only control of the city council, but of its blatantly unwinnable equal-pay fight too. Cue a couple of decisions from the Court of Session and the current administration has been left staring down the barrel of a multi-million-pound liability that should have been settled years ago.The problem is that the longer the issue has been allowed to fester the bigger that liability has become and the authority appears to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. Though council leader Susan Aitken committed in January to agreeing a settlement this year, so far nothing has been forthcoming, with the womenrsquos legal and trade union representatives accusing the council of burying its head in the sand over even the most basic of issues.Unsurprisingly, the women are irate, and those who are members of the Unison and GMB trade unions are preparing for strike action that could see key cleaning, caring and cooking services in the city grind to a halt in the coming weeks. Yet while their anger is understandable and their cause is deserving of support, the prospect of the strike is worrying precisely because of what it is designed to achieve.All industrial action has an end point in sight, whether it be to increase wages or protect existing rights, and the end point for the Glasgow strikers is to force an immediate settlement of these long-overdue claims. The problem is,Glasgow settles now it is likely to open itself up to further claims of discrimination in the future, with the perfect storm of its discredited pay structure and its obligations under pensions legislation putting any woman approaching retirement at risk.A  update to local government pension rules means that pension contributions must be paid on all equal-pay settlements. Yet because pensions are calculated based on salary, any claimant retiring before Glasgow replaces its pay scheme - something it has committed to do, but which could take years to complete - will have paid extra into the Strathclyde fund without the guarantee of receiving the correct pension in .No wonder Glasgow is baulking at the prospect of brokering a deal. Nor is it the only local authority to freeze in the face of its pension obligations, with the Herald on Sunday revealing at the weekend that councils across the country are playing fast and loose with the pensions legislation, to the degree that some are complying with it while some are merely thinking about it and others are ignoring it altogether.The end result is that women are being discriminated against simply because of the area they chose to live and work in, with an equal-pay cleaner in Dumfries and Galloway getting her pension rerated long before the law was changed to say that was her right while her counterpart in Argyll  Bute has effectively been told to whistle.And so, while some councils grapple with what should be a simple concept, the women who help keep this country going with their daily graft are being left to suffer the consequences. Indeed, while it seems clear that Glasgow City Council has neither the means nor the wherewithal to give its equal-pay women what they deserve, the scatter-gun approach councils in general are taking to observing their pension obligations is creating yet another layer of inequality. The fact that that layer lies between the very women that were discriminated against in the first place is beyond ironic - and beyond unacceptable.Which is why, far from taking their strike to the streets of Glasgow, the cityrsquos workers should be leading women from every part of the country in a march to the gates of Holyrood to demand the Scottish Government intervenes. Councils have had long enough to tinker around the edges of equal pay it is time a higher power took control to ensure unorm justice for all.Such action would likely be a success, too,recent history is anything to go by. Indeed, just last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cut short an official engagement in Germany to come to the aid of the male workers of troubled engineering firm BiFab after they took the fight for their livelihoods to the streets of Edinburgh. The Government handed over a total of pound million and helped broker the buyout of BiFab by Canadian firm JV Driver, even though the dire straits the business had been floundering in meant practically all the workers went on to lose their jobs anyway.Buthundreds of boiler-suited men marching on parliament can prompt such a reaction, just think what thousands of tabard-wearing women could achieve. Who knows, they might even be able to force the Government to sort this whole mess out in time for the th anniversary of the  Equal Pay Act. And wouldnrsquot that be something "},{"url":null,"title":"david-mundell-urges-snp-to-take-indyref2-off-the-table","story":"Scottish Secretary David Mundell has urged the SNP to take a second independence referendum \"off the table\".Mr Mundell, speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to snap out of her \"constitutional Groundhog Day\" and get on with the day job of running Scotland.The Cabinet minister also criticised Jeremy Corbyn for his decision not to rule out another independence vote.The Labour leader previously said he was \"not ruling out\" giving consent for a second referendum and he would decide on the issue \"at the time\".Mr Mundell said: \"Every day that Scotland is stuck in a constitutional Groundhog Day is a day that our economy is being held back and that the SNP Government is not getting on with the day job of managing our schools and hospitals.\"So I want to use this opportunity to say to Sturgeon, it is time to end the constitutional uncertainty that we have lived with for the past four years.\"It is time for Scotlands two governments to work together in the best interests of the Scottish people.

The consequences would be dire in terms of disruption not only to trade in manufactured goods, but in the short run to food supply in the UK, air travel, enforcement of existing contracts in other EU countries. The list goes on.Sir Anton was speaking at a summit organised by Glasgow City Council on how Clydeside businesses and institutions, including the local authority itself, can brace themselves for economic uncertainty.His language moved well beyond the normally diplomatic advice of a public intellectual. He said: ldquoIn my view, a hard Brexit would represent the most unhinged example of national self-sabotage in living memory ndash and everyone in public le has a duty, a moral obligation, to do what we can to prevent it.ldquoAny politician refusing to try ndash who wonrsquot even attempt to soften the pain of Brexit by making the case for single market membership which all logic tells them is the right thing to do ndash is guilty of a serious dereliction of duty.ldquoAndtheir failure of leadership sets our economy and our society back for generations, history will judge them very harshly indeed.Glasgow City Council has commissioned analysis from Strathclyde Universityrsquos Fraser of Allander Institute showing that some , jobs in the city region depend on EU links.Sir Anton has been advising the Scottish Government on Brexit and cited figures showing that the worst case scenario leaving the EU could cost Scotland more than  billion in lost economic growth. Economists call this a ldquoheadwind, a drag on the economy whether it is growing or shrinking. ldquoWe simply cannot allow this to happen, he said. Sir Anton believes there is now a ldquo- per cent chance of a clf edge, no deal Brexit.The economist, like many others had been dismissed as a scaremonger. Now, he said, Project Fear had become ldquoProject Fact. Theresa Mayrsquos Chequers deal - her compromise offer to the EU hated by Tory Eurosceptics - was ldquodead.Lord John Kerr, the former UK diplomat who drafted the now infamous ldquoArticle  - the technical means by which Britain looks set to leave the EU - agreed Mrs Mayrsquos plan was lost.But he told the same conference that it was not too late for the UK to change its mind. ldquoLegally, we have not burnt our boats yet, he said.Glasgow-educated Lord Kerr is campaigning for a second referendum on the EU and believes article  - due to end the UKrsquos membership of the EU next spring - can be put on hold pending such a vote.The politics around a ldquoPeoplersquos Vote remains complex with both main UK parties split.

He was aged only  but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July , . His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost  children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

September has a high rate of babies being born.ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: ldquoItrsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in. They should be commended for all their efforts.ldquoTravelling to Raigmore places more than enough strain on the mums and their families so going to Glasgow would have added to that. I can fully understand why someone at Raigmore would want to whistle-blow as it appears to be a pretty fraught situation.An NHS Highland spokesman said: ldquoDue to the unpredictable nature of maternity activity, cases are assessed on an inidual basis and robust risk assessment and escalation plans are in place to ensure safe service provision.ldquoTo date, since accepting intrapartum transfers from Elgin, there has been no need for any Caithness woman to be erted from Raigmore Hospital to deliver where due to staffing levels or capacity, as is being suggested by the midwe whom you interviewed.Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117725.jpg","title":"Businesses have lots to celebrate","story":"CAITHNESS Chamber of Commerce celebrated another successful year for business in the North Highlands at its th annual dinner on Friday.Around  organisations were represented at the event in Wicks Norseman Hotel which again underlined the ersity of the local business community and showcased the opportunities the area has to offer.After a welcome from the chambers chairman, Stephen Sutherland, and an opening speech from chamber patron Lord Thurso, guests heard a speech from Cathy Craig, commercial and memberships director of Entrepreneurial Scotland.Cathy spoke passionately about entrepreneurialism in Scotland and explained how her grandmother sparked her interest in business.

In China, more than  million dogs are killed and eaten every year.Robert, who will have reached Inverness by the time you have picked up your copy of the Groat, said: ldquoI started campaigning against the dog-meat trade in the far east after seeing a YouTube clip showing the terrible cruelty inflicted on the dogs destined to be eaten.ldquoAs a child in Indonesia, I would hear about family pets being sold or stolen for meat.ldquoNow I aim to do all that I can to save dogs from that horrible fate. My organisation, Walking to Save Dogs, raises funds to support carefully selected local shelters and projects that rescue dogs from these Festivals and the meat trade.ldquoThe ultimate goal is to put an end to the dog-meat trade through education that dogs are sentient beings, changing legislation, and providing dog-meat traders with alternative means to support their families.Robert aims to reach John OrsquoGroats by September , although he has already lost one of his canine companions.He added: ldquoSadly, Madeleine recently developed an eye problem so has gracefully pawed out.ldquoShe continues to support the rest of the pack from a comfy armchair at home.ldquoMy pets are the voice of millions of less fortunate dogs.ldquoThey have been well-prepared for this task and they love the outdoors.ldquoWe have been walking  miles a day on average and hope to finish our walk within a couple of weeks.ldquoI am touched beyond words at the kindness and generosity of the Scottish people I have met along the trail and look forward to meeting lots more on the way to John OrsquoGroats.To follow Robertrsquos progress and to donate, go to: www.walkingtosavedogs or www.justgiving crowdfunding walkingtosavedogsWednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117727.jpg","title":"Grand Tour takes Paul to Altnabreac and Kildonan","story":"TV presenter Paul Murton makes his way to Caithness and Sutherland in next weeks edition of his current series, Grand Tours of Scotlands Lochs.During the course of the half-hour programme Paul heads to one of Britains remotest railway stations, Altnabreac.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said pound, in total would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotWednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar  was incomplete and that some ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar .Mr Black offered an apology for the auditrsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and itrsquos costing us a lot of money. That canrsquot be changed unless wersquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: ldquoThe councilrsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. Itrsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive yearrsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.ldquoPerhaps I shouldnrsquot be surprised. When the council does collect information it regularly ignores it ndash all too evident in the shambles that is their public toilet closure plan.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808556.1538487783!/image/image.jpg","title":"motorhome business cashes in on north coast 500 success","story":"A Highland motorhome company has signalled further growth thanks to the popularity of the North Coast  route.North  Motorhomes, which is based in Inverness, is in the process of growing its fleet and expanding into the Central Belt after a successful second season.The firm has now invested more than £ million in its fleet of motorhomes and site in the city.The company’s operations director Colin Harrison said: “Our first year was really about dipping our toe in the market and testing the level of demand.

One of the things which I’ve liked best is writing these columns I see myself as a charming old gentproducing harmless copy for your amusement and thus had been the case until my last piece. This was the one where I suggested that some young people were cleverer than others. This seems to me to be completely self-evident, just like saying that some people are taller, or sing better, or have blue eyes. : Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersHowever, it received more reaction than all the other pieces put together, ranging from praise – describing me as “brave” – to others who felt my points were “not helpful” or “elitist”. What’s going on  All I said was something which we all know.What I didn’t say was anything about what causes some young people to be more intelligent. I think it’s probably something genetic and something to do with upbringing andI had to state a more definite view I’d go with a   split, having observed plenty of parents and their kids over the years. But that wasn’t my point and I doubtthere’s anything like a definitive answer.Also, what I didn’t say was that intelligence was the be all and end all. I really, really don’t believe that. Even in the unashamedly academic school I worked in, we spent all our time encouraging the students to work hard and to be kind to each other. We didn’t make hierarchical gods out of clever boys and girls any more than we did of the best football players or the most talented trumpeters. It was very clear indeed all the way through my career that lots of other factors apart from intelligence affected young people’s performance. In his book in the “All That Matters” series on “Intelligence”, the Edinburgh academic Dr Stuart Ritchie makes it clear that intelligence is quite definitely not all that matters: “Being bright is critically important [to educational achievement], but so are other characteristics like conscientiousness, motivation and self-control, as well as ious social skills.”Dr Ritchie is a wee bit scathing about the idea of other “intelligences” but we know the kinds of thingsits proponents are talking about. I would say I was quite clever but a car engine, say, is a thing of which I am deeply frightened. I greatly admire the ability of someone who can fix them and I think it’s perfectly reasonable to see it as a dferent ‘intelligence’ evenit doesn’t help in getting Higher French. Similarly with “emotional intelligence”, though I’m not very sure how you measure that ...Another thing I didn’t say was that intelligence made you happy. Anyone who has taught or been a GP or a lawyer or a social worker or a minister of religion has met loads and loads of miserable clever people. If there is a recipe for happiness, I can’t think it would involve a high IQ, rather than, say, lots of friends, several units of alcohol and a high-end doughnut shop. I’m not good at working out visual-spatial problemsbut I can’t really say it’s ever made me unhappy, apart from the odd bumped nose.: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertNo, I didn’t say any of these things. I said that some people were more intelligent than others, and I think the education system isn’t erse enough to cope with the range of abilities it’s presented with. I think that Scotland needs to examine, radically and soon, the way we educate the cleverest and least clever children in our society, because currently the former are bored, unstretched and not reaching their potential and the latter are struggling with meaningless work, and they are also bored and not reaching their potential. Again, this is not because of teachers, who almost universally work very hard and really care about their charges. It’s about education policy and the wish of government, over a long period, to see education as a social experiment rather than education. The other thing is that parents really worry about their children’s intelligence but they don’t say so, whether their child is Stephen Hawking or, well, let’s say, “someone less intelligent” in order to avoid unpleasantness in the comments section. I well remember my Parents’ Night interview with Professor and Mrs Lecter, about their son.“To be honest, this has not been a great term for Hannibal. It began with that unfortunate incident in Home Economics, where he brought the wrong ingredients for the recipe and also failed to tidy up properly. Then in Biology where he misunderstood the instructions during the dissection we are all very lucky that the injury to the other boy was only superficial, and we have taken on board your views on risk management. Really his relationship with the other pupils is fraught, and we are very concerned about his diet. His Guidance teacher had his work cut out and the situation has not been helped by Mr Smith’s extended absence from school and the dficulties wee have had getting hold of him ...” I paused to take a breath.“But Mr Wyllie, will this affect Hannibal’s chances of doing medicine at Cambridge ”Cameron Wyllie, a retired headteacher, publishes a blog called A House in Joppa©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4808847.1538504302!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment common sense to prevail over double hampden semi final","story":"Former Hearts player Allan Preston spoke for many when he suggested the decision to play two cup semi-finals at Hampden on the same day could be one of the worst decisions ever made by the Scottish Professional Football League.So clearly it is welcome news that the SPFL is now considering moving the Hearts-Celtic match to Murrayfield.

Ms Sturgeon has been accused of politicians in Scotland, as well as some industry leaders, of seeking to leave control of Scotland’s fishing waters with Brussels indefinitely.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.

Signatures will be collected in the village for petitions ndash to present to Macdonalds at a later date ndash and at the resort which is currently staging the prestigious Europarc conference being attended by some  delegates.A key theme of the gathering is Scotlands Year of Young People , It was highlighted at the meeting this was at odds with denying local tots, children and teens access to the pool.After the meeting, SOS  coordinator Joe Kirby said: \"It was a really productive meeting with lots of great ideas coming forward from those there.\"There was a clear feeling within the room that we need to raise the campaigns profile and get both parties talking again so that the community can get back to using the pool.\"We will be starting with a peaceful show of support for affordable local swimming at the resort and in the wider Aviemore from early evening and there are plenty of more suggestions which we have taken on board and will be looking to develop over the coming days and weeks.\"Our sincere hope, however, is that both parties can reach an agreement very soon: that way everyone is a winner ndash Macdonald Hotels, Highland Council and the community.\"It is understood to renew the High Le Highland deal the hotel giant had initially in the spring asked for pound, in year one pound, in year two and pound, in the final year.Earlier this month a three-year deal agreement had been struck in principle via email exchanges only for the local authority to see that the hotel company did a U-turn.It would have seen Highland Council pay pound, with index linked increases either CPI or . per cent and HLH users pay pound.or pound per family per visit over the three-year periodThe council has said the deal will give Macdonald Aviemore Resort approximately pound, per year ndash more than the hotel operator had been looking for at the outset.MacdonaldHotelsconfirmed they intend to reopen talks next week.A spokesman said: \"We remain keen to see this situation resolved, which would be in everyonersquos interests ndash especially those local people who are unable to enjoy use of the pool.\"However, wersquove been consistent in stressing that any compromise must be on the basis that the scheme is financially sustainable, taking into account the very signicant rises in costs we have had to meet.\"Over the past two years alone, the resort has seen staff costs rise by  per cent to pound. million, a  per cent increase in energy costs to more than pound million and a  per cent jump in business rates, which are now over pound, annually.\"In an attempt to overcome the impasse, we will be making contact with the council early next week to see whether we can resolve this unfortunate situation.\"But itrsquos clear that any reasonable, long-term solution needs to take these hard facts into account.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117758.jpg","title":"Highland search for Calum","story":"Tom RamagePolice in Inverness are continuing with enquiries to trace Calum Anderson who has been reported missing from his home in the city.The -year-old - also known as Malcolm - was reported missing from the Culduthel area of the city on Sunday, September .The most recent confirmed sighting of him is at the Asda supermarket shortly after pm on that day.Extensive enquiries are ongoing to trace him and officers are urging anyone who can help to get in touch as soon as possible.Chief Inspector James Rice said: \"As times passes we naturally grow increasingly concerned for Calumrsquos well-being.\"We know that he was seen at Asda in the Slackbuie area around pm but we have no confirmed sightings of Calum after that.\"Calum is known to walk extensively.

He could not understand why locals should not be able to access the pool facilities at this time.He said: \"I work with sustainable tourism myself. This does not sound like sustainable tourism to me. In my opinion tourism should benefit local communities.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard. They should never be written off.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo.jpg","title":"skye based charity helps to save the live three people in five","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLisa MacInnes, director of the national organisation Save a Le Scotland has described the survival of Cherill Parryfrom Gairloch, Ian MacLeodfrom Inverness, and -year-old John Burgis from Port of Ness in Lewis — each of whom was treated with a LuckyBhere automatic external defibrillator — as “exceptional” and said that the work of the charity should “inspire other communities throughout Scotland”.On Saturday th June, Cherill Parry was walking her dog in Gairloch when she started to feel unwell. “I had been walking the dog and was feeling rough, so I went to the doctor. Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1046550.jpg--.jpg?1537864027000\n","title":"ballymena rockers out to spread some joy","story":"A new rocking phenomenon is taking Ballymena by storm in the form of finding and creating little painted rocks hid around the town.Ballymena Rocks was born out of an idea by local woman Doreen Armstrong who became involved with Rocks NI after finding little painted rocks around Portrush and enquiring what their purpose was.The idea is that people paint rocks with colour and add some words of inspiration and then hide or leave them around public places such as parks or town centres to bring a smile to the person who finds them with the Ballymena Rocks Facebook page already having over  members, all creating, hiding and finding rocks around the town.Doreen was keen to bring the practice to Ballymena after having great fun finding and creating her own rocks over the Summer in Portrush. Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

A spokesperson for Dromore Nursery said: “As outstanding early years educators, we aim to offer every child equality of opportunity, it has not always been easy to translate this aspiration into practice. However, it has been delivered through genuine commitment and a willingness to challenge the deep rooted, often unquestioned, attitudes, values and practices which can and do discriminate against some children and families. “It is not about ‘treating all children the same’. Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      UFU welcomes speed limit at local schools Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"A spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.The church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.   The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church.

We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it.

People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm.Sad passing of Molly Lutton Shoppers urged to continue to show support for Belfast city centre retailers Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

Walkers and cyclists will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of fresh air and exercise along an extended riverside trail, linking parkland off Bridge Street to the attractive Woodlands Park, thanks to the commencement of Phase  of the Gilford Riverside Trail project.The extended trail will provide an off-road route linking both ends of the town and passing the iconic Gilford Mill buildings along the way.Work on the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council project is due to start in mid-October with completion scheduled for Spring .Part of the riverside trail will run on top of the old millrace, continuing between the river and the in-filled mill pond, past the former Gilford mill buildings joining with a new footbridge over the mill race into Woodlands Park. The installation of new seating, lighting and landscaping along the route will help make the trail accessible to all.It has been a goal for many years to connect all council owned open space along the river and this latest set of works is the final piece of the jigsaw which has been made possible thanks to £, funding secured from SOARVillage Renewal Measure.During the course of the works some disruption to the area may be necessary including the temporary closure of the footbridge at Gilford Community Centre and certain access points to the park.

The centre has been part of the Upper Springfield since  but it has changed and developed since then. I came onboard around two years ago and the centre is really about addressing the physical and mental health needs of the area.”The Healthy Living Centre is one of many successful projects managed by the Upper Springfield Development Trustwith physical activity classes including boxercise, zumba, pilates and circuit classes running in Corpus Christi parish church hall throughout the week. “We are open to what people want to do,” added Rosie, “we have an extremely popular Couch to K initiative and we have armchair aerobics as well for those less abled.“We also offer a counselling service here, the space here is really utilised. We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health. It can’t be stressed enough how important it is in today’s society, there is something for everyone at the centre and we are here to offer advice and guidance where we can.”For more information and a class timetable go towww.facebook UpperSpringfieldHealthyLivingCentre"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"THE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted  responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.Mr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"belfast glider bus leads to 17 rise in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

One user joked it would soon be quicker to drive to Dublin than get through the airports security.Its thought bottlenecks occur because of people arriving at the airport too early for their flight while others show up at the advised time leading to more passengers than expected arriving at one time. The airport took to the social network to remind people to arrive at least two hours before departure.\"Carefully packing your bags at home can help us reduce the time it takes to get you through security,\" it tweeted.A spokeswoman added: \"We apologise to any passengers who suffered delays as a result of queues at security this morning.

It was not like it was going slow, it was just the sheer volume of people trying to get through.\"And by the time I got through it all the queue was just the same . It was a nightmare.\"He added: \"We went away for our holidays in the summer and had a  minute queue then. But you expect that over the Twelfth fortnight not at the beginning of October when it is mainly just commuters.\"The thing that really got me today was there was no one giving advice or even helping people who were about to miss their flights.

Wilson James will take over security operations on November .Belfast International Airport urged passengers to be prepared for security checks before arriving at the airport to speed the process along.\"Adhering to these guidelines and carrying only essential items in hand luggage can help reduce the need for manual checks at security, which can quickly cause queues to build up,\" the spokeswoman added.The airports guidelines include: Ensuring hand luggage is not densely packedAll non-essential liquids are packed in hold baggageAny liquids brought through security must be in a l resealable plastic bag All laptops, tablets etc must be removed from  hand luggage Remove all coats, belts etc"},{"url":null,"title":"no decision on planning permission for tyrone gold mine until minister in place","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Des Stewart, chairman of the Ulster Grand Prix Supporters Club, said a groundswell of opposition to the -acre site had united fans, race promoters and residents, and prompted more than , letters of objection, which were handed to the council in .\"Race fans far and wide felt so strongly about the impact these plans could have on this international event that they launched a Dont Bury the UGP petition, which has been supported by motorcycle fans around the world,\" he said.It was estimated that the lespan of the cemetery would be  years and would require an initial investment of £m. The proposed site would also include funeral facilities, catering, parking, woodland walkways and a memorial garden.But Mr Stewart had warned that the economic impact on the Ulster Grand Prix - which attracts tens of thousands of international visitors and generates millions of pounds to the local economy - would be signicant.The local authoritys planning committee agreed that the economic benefits of the cemetery would be limited following the construction phase, which they considered to be excessive and unacceptable.Councillor James Tinsley said: \"From day one local residents told the applicant in no uncertain terms that the proposal was not acceptable to them, due to the unsuitability of the site, road infrastructure, the areas propensity for inclement weather and the harm it would cause to the local area and community.\"Noel Johnston, UGP Clerk of the Course, also welcomed the rejection. However, the company behind the proposal, Carston, expressed its disappointment that \"there is apparently no need\" for the cemeteries, and pointed out that pressure is growing on existing burial plots.\"It is well known that there is no available land within the Belfast City Council area for a cemetery mainly due to underlying geological conditions,\" a Carston spokesperson said. \"In west Belfast, we understand there are less than , plots remaining in Milltown cemetery and virtually none where in that locality. \"Funeral directors have expressed concern about the lack of affordable burial provision. Despite an approval for a cemetery outside Moira recently, the lack of burial space is also a problem within Lisburn City area, with growing pressure on Blaris cemetery.\"The company spokesperson also said it had spent a lot of money seeking planning approval and called on Belfast City Council to intervene in the rowit wants to see \"a vital piece of civic infrastructure\" become a reality.

The all-weather leboat under coxswain William Chambers launched within minutes into the middle of Storm Ali as it unleashed its devastating power.The challenging weather conditions the crew was going to face en route to Newtownards were immediately apparent after launch, with the coxswain requesting the closure of main water tight doors as the vessel was battered by eight metre high waves.A Force  gale was blowing as the crew approached Strangford Lough some  minutes after the seas started to settle as the leboat was sheltered by the shore.On arrival at the yacht club, the Coastguard was concerned that there may be a person on board the weather beaten vessel, but it was subsequently confirmed there wasnrsquot.The leboat was then requested to go the aid of another yacht drting across the lough from Whiterock and Kircubbin. Unfortunately, by the time the leboat reached the vessel there was nothing the crew could do as it was on the rocks on an ebbing tide.As the leboat made herjourney to Newcastle and was approaching Portaferry, the crew were alerted to another yacht in dficulty. The crew established a tow line and managed to free the vessel and towed it to the safety off a mooring in Strangford marina.Theto Newcastle was another hazardous journey as the crew battled mountainous seas, forcing the vessel to stop at Ardglass marina for an hour to allow the storm force wind to ease and the waves to decrease. The leboat left the marina at pm, ing home one hour later.ldquoThis was a challenging day for our volunteers given that we launched into rough seas when Storm Ali was at its worst, said Coxswain William Chambers when safely back ashore. ldquoOur volunteers are highly skilled and trained for these situations and were delighted to be able to help.Some of the largest trees to fall victim to last weekendrsquos storm have been a prominent landmark in Castlewellanrsquos Lower Square for generations.Slieve Croob councillor Roiacutesiacuten Howell believes the location of the fallen trees should be the future home of the townrsquos permanent Christmas tree.ldquoLike many other residents who have grown up in the area their whole le, I was saddened to see these two great trees blow down.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8724877.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Connel McMullan, pictured at the inquiry, is Fergal Hegartys boss The RHI Inquiry is due to be finished by that stage.Yesterday a lawyer told Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry that it had not even obtained a witness statement from Mr Hegarty.He was first named publicly in relation to the RHI scandal in January  by the News Letter after this newspaper received leaked emails showing that he had disseminated information which he received from civil servants to others in the renewables industry.The emails from mid-summer , the point where the scheme was running out of control, show that the industry had advance warning of looming cost controls – a factor which enabled more people to pile into the uncapped ‘cash for ash’ scheme.Before publishing details of the contact, the News Letter repeatedly sought to contact Mr Hegarty by phone and email, but he did not respond.Yesterday his situation arose in questions to his boss.Connel McMullan, a director of Alternative Heat, yesterday gave evidence to the inquiry.Senior counsel to the inquiry David Scoffield QC put it to him: “A lot of the emails that we’ve seen from your company involve Mr Hegarty some of them involve you.“Mr Hegarty would have been someone that the inquiry was interested in getting evidence from. Our understanding is that he has been out of the country for most of the last year, year and a half, travelling. Is that right ”Mr McMullan said: “Yes, he’s on a sabbatical travelling around the world.”Mr Scoffield asked: “Is he being paid by your company while he’s away ”Tragic Rhonda O’Loughlin was ‘free spirit’, says grieving sister Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr McMullan said that he was not being paid and was “on leave”.Mr Scoffield said: “On the basis that he has been away, we haven’t been able to get evidence from him directly, which is one of the reasons that I’m asking you about some of the emails that he’s sent. Was his sabbatical in any way related to this inquiry or the possibility that he might be asked to give evidence ”Mr McMullan said: “Not in my understanding, no.”When askedhe had discussed that with Mr Hegarty, Mr McMullan said: “Em. It’s not something that I’ve discussed with him, no. Em, he is aware of the inquiry and aware of the media stigma that runs with that but he is also well aware of his position and where we stand as a company so I don’t believe it would have any bearing on any decision he would make on that front.”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin askedMr Hegarty’s expenses were being paid during his absence from Northern Ireland. Mr McMullan said: “No.”He added that his job was being retained and “he is set to[at the] end of this year, start of next year, I believe – that’s where he was hoping to be back so, yeah, he’s a year out basically...”Mr Scoffield said that the inquiry did not even have a written statement from Mr Hegarty, despite attempting to contact him through his company.In one of Mr Hegarty’s emails which the inquiry has compelled his company to release, he referred to “the fact that the poultry industry is exploiting the scheme”. Mr McMullan said that he did not have evidence of the scheme being abused in the poultry industry.Mr McMullan said that his company “did supply every email that we had on the system that was in relation to him”.Mr Scoffield said that it seemed that whatever information was being provided to Mr Hegarty by civil servants was being written down in emails and “sent out quite openly”.Mr McMullan said that Mr Hegary was “very good at his job”.Although his company had received advance notice through Mr Hegarty that RHI was to be made less lucrative in , Mr McMullan said that he had not realised until “early February”  that the scheme was to be shut completely.However, in one of several questions which only Mr Hegarty can answer, the inquiry was told that an email from Mr Hegarty showed that the previous month he was aware that the scheme was likely to be closing and was asking civil servants to send him details of what would be happening.Mr McMullan said he did not know how Mr Hegarty knew that the scheme was likely to be closing and then told the inquiry “I can find out”.Sir Patrick asked him: “How can you find out ”The witness said: “Well I can ask him I can ask Fergal.”Sir Patrick said: “So you’re in touch with him, are you ”Mr McMullan said: “Aye, yeah. He carries his phone and he’s contactable, yeah.”try catch     .               ..

Cherith and her late brother Neil, whom she describes as the baby of the family Just weeks before his th birthday, Neil, from Garrison in Co Fermanagh, died in a tragic accident while on work experience at a local garage.His sister Cherith, who recently completed the Great North Run in his memory, has bravely spoken about her struggles following Neil’s death.The -year-old, the eldest of the family’s four children, said: “The first weeks and months in particular felt impossible and it was hard to think we’d ever be able to do anything without this sadness after this huge shock. “We all still have many bad moments and days where it’s hard to keep going but we do because we think what Neil would have wanted and we know he’d want us to be happy.    Cherith on completion of the Great North Run “So we just keep going and treasure every memory we have of him. “We’re not alone as there are so many more people who are missing him every single day.”Neil lived with his family in Garrison, close to the border with Leitrim and Donegal, and had been in a relationship since last November.Neil was the youngest of four children – “the baby of the family” as Cherith describes him.   The late Neil Graham She said: “We’ll remember his laid back approach to everything and his soft and caring nature. His love for animals, driving tractors and country music. “We definitely won’t forget the  hens he brought home in the boot of his car or Rosie the goat. “He loved trying to fix anything technical and we’ll miss his handiness.”Neil had left Portora Royal School in Enniskillen after doing his GCSEs, to follow his love of machinery and fixing things.PSNI warns ‘club sex girl’ has been ly

Neil included  In terms of starting a career, Neil began a course in land-based engineering in South West College in Omagh. As part of this course, he was doing a work placement three days a week. It was while he was on one of these work experience sessions at a garage in the Boho Road area, to the west of Enniskillen, that the incident which led to Neil’s death occurred.An inquest has yet to take place but it is understood Neil was repairing a tractor when a part fell on him.Emergency services attended, but he died at the scene.Cherith said: “We’re so happy he got to achieve what he did in his letime, it just feels terribly cruel that it was cut so short. “We’ll never forget him. I used to think it couldn’t be true when people say that they thought of someone they have lost every day but it’s absolutely true for us.”At the time of Neil’s funeral his family had asked for donations in lieu of flowers. A total of £, was raised for Air Ambulance NI and £, for Garrison Parish Church.In addition to the money raised in lieu of flowers Neil’s sister Cherith took part in the Great North Run in Newcastle-on-Tyne on Sunday to raise further funds for Air Ambulance NI.Cherith said: “The fundraising hasn’t been easy for all of us. I know I personally have struggled quite a lot. “It’s sometimes hard to feel positive about it because we would do anything to have Neil back.But at the end of the day this is the situation we are in andby supporting Air Ambulance NI in particular, it might even help save someone  one day.”Of the Great North Run, she said: “I have run one other half marathon previously – the Royal Parks half marathon in  – so this was my second half marathon race. “I found the lead up to the Great North Run more dficult that the run itself. “Dedicating the run in Neil’s memory made it a very emotional experience and I was totally bowled over by friend’s and family’s generosity in their sponsorship for Air Ambulance NI. “I was doing each step for Neil so I made sure to enjoy it. As I came down the hill at mile  towards the coast and a country song was playing I knew he was with me. “I was never a sporty person by any stretch of the imagination and only picked up running just over a year ago“It was always something Neil found a bit funny so that made me enjoy it even more to think I would have been putting a smile on his face.”Askedshe planned to continue to motivate yourself in her brother’s memory, she said Neil’s memory would always “push her on to greater things” but that she did not plan on undertaking any more physical challenges for the foreseeable future.Of the possibility of a permanent memorial said: “We are thinking about replacing a plain window in our churchwith a stained glass window that could be in memory of him. “The window is in the porch of the church and almost the last thing you see as you leave so I think it would feel like he’s there watching over us all on a Sunday and on all the special occasions that we’ll have there in the future.“We don’t have any plans for more fundraising ourselves.”Discussing her own grief, Cherith said: “For me this felt and continues to feel like nothing I ever could have imagined. “I find talking about it, especially during the bad times, helps and I’ve been doing whatever  I can to figure it all out.“That could mean listening to podcasts – Griefcast is a good one and not too morbid – or reading articles from other people who’ve been through bereavement.“This week I went to my first bereavement counselling session.” She commented: “I trained as a mental health first aider at my work and through that am really aware of the need to help yourself because no one  can know what’s going through your head or what will help.”Cherith added: “Our community have been a huge support for my family through this time. From the moment of the accident our wider family have helped us through each step and our local community have been pillars of support. “Even on the day of the funeral when there must have been over a thousand people, there were friends and neighbours making sure we were okay and that everyone attending the service was okay, even bringing trays upon trays of iced water to the many people stood around the church as it was such a hot day.“I know my parents especially really appreciate every single card and visit from friends and even strangers they have received and continue to receive. The kindness has been strengthening for all of us.”Sadly the family are no strangers to heartbreak – during the Troubles, Neil’s mother’s brother was murdered by the IRA.Joy Graham’s brother Ronnie Funston – an ex-UDR member – was shot dead by the IRA in March  as he was preparing to feed cattle early in the morning on a farm at Lowery near Pettigo. “Unfortunately I know only too much what it’s like to experience tragedy like this,” Joy told the News Letter at the time of her son’s death in May.Of her son Joy said: “He was a great people person. He loved country music and jiving, going to the country jamborees. He was a great boy – a lovely caring boy. “He wanted his own business. That’s what he’d have loved – that was his dream. “He was trying to get his qualications, learn his trade, and open his own business some day as a tractor mechanic.”Cherith told how important her family’s faith has been in the dark days since Neil’s death.Such is their devotion to God that half of the money raised in lieu of flowers has gone to Garrison Parish.Cherith said: “It’s been a really important place for us. “We go every Sunday we’re at home and my mum plays the organ for every service.“We’ve leaned on our faith a lot over the last few months and our minister Ngozi has been a great support too. “[The donation] felt like the least we could do and we know Neil would have been pleased with that choice. “It was only three days before his accident that Neil had been helping to mow the grass in the graveyard, little to know it was for his own funeral. Although I think he’d say, ‘well at least I got to do a good job’.”The other half of the money raised in Neil’s memory went to Air Ambulance NI: “We are so grateful to everything that the Air Ambulance NI team did when they tried to save Neil. “If it wasn’t for them we’d always have wonderedhe could have been saved.”try catch     .               ..

Harry Gibson from Beragh passed away in a tragic accident last month On Tuesday, the -year-old’s family received the devastating news that her body had been located.Her sudden death is the third tragedy to hit the close-knit community of Beragh in recent weeks. Young farmer Harry Gibson died in tragic accident last weekend, while Kyra McKinley from the village was killed in a road crash in August.Rhonda’s sister Yvonne Reid recounted her family’s “living nightmare” during the week her sister had been missing, And while the cause of Rhonda’s death is not yet known, Yvonne said the family is thankful that they can now begin to grieve.   Kyra McKinley from Beragh was killed in a road crash in August “We are not sure at this point what has actually happened,” she told the News Letter.“It appears she has gone out for a walk and fallen. When I last saw her a few days before she disappeared everything was normal. She was joking and having a laugh.“She had been involved in a car accident a few weeks ago. The feeling now is that maybe that is connected in some way maybe she had a knock to the head or something. We just don’t know at this point.”Recalling the traumatic experience of joining in the search for her missing sister, Yvonne said: “There had only been one sighting of Rhonda out walking on the road, and other than that there were no leads whatsoever. “We really struggled to cope with the uncertainty and not knowing what had happened. We searched for days on end, no one went to work during that week. But the support we had from friends was amazing and it has really helped us through this. We also can’t thank the Garda enough for all their efforts.” It is understood Rhonda’s body was discovered by farmers. A post mortem examination is due to be carried out today to determine the cause of her death.Rhonda, the youngest of four siblings, was employed as a community nurse. She moved to Donegal around five years ago to live with her boyfriend.Man wanted by RHI Inquiry has left Northern IrelandArlene Foster confronted by gay journalist on same-sex marriage views Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Paying tribute to her “baby sister”, Yvonne said: “She was a free spirit. She was a caring, bubbly and happy go lucky person who will be deeply missed.”Garda told the Irish Mirror that Rhonda’s death is not being treated as suspicious.A family notice stated that Rhonda was the “dearly loved daughter of John and Pat, loving sister of Derek, Yvonneand Heather , a dear sister-in-law, much loved Auntie Rhonda and girlfriend of Martin.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Firm on the union and standing by Scotlands fishing industry. Internationalist in outlook and rooted in the centre ground at home. pic RvCbZIOVVmdash Ruth DavidsonOctober , Congratulations @theresa_may for a remarkable speech delivered with humour and passion. Firmness of purpose, clarity and conviction ndash EU friends do not underestimate!mdash Jeremy HuntOctober , Admitting that the housing market is ldquobroken, she announced she was lting the cap on councils borrowing to fund new developments, with the aim of ldquobuilding the homes this country needs.In a speech designed to rally her party behind her following a conference riven by dferences over Brexit, Mrs May warned that squabbling over the details of EU withdrawal might mean ldquoending up with no Brexit at all.Standing firmly by the Chequers plan which was denounced by Boris Johnson as a ldquoconstitutional outrage, Mrs May promised: ldquoIf we stick together and hold our nerve, I know we can get a deal that delivers for Britain.She made no mention of the former foreign secretary, who won thunderous applause from , activists on Tuesday as he called on her to ldquochuck the Brexit plan agreed at her country residence in July.But she delivered a stinging riposte to his reported ldquof*** business comment, saying the business community should know that ldquothere is a four-letter word to describe what we Conservatives want to do to you ndash it has a single syllable, it is of Anglo-Saxon derivation, it ends in the letter K. Back businesses.James Duddridge has submitted a letter of no confidence in the Prime Minister Less than an hour before taking the stage in Birmingham, Mrs May was hit by a call for her removal from former minister James Duddridge, who said she was ldquoincapable of providing the leadership Tories need.But she did her best to appear carefree as she sashayed on to the stage to the Abba hit Dancing Queen ndash a reference to the much-shared video of her dancing on a trip to Africa ndash and joked about the coughing fit and collapsing stage backdrop which marred her calamitous conference speech in Manchester last year.In an upbeat message to activists and voters, she declared: ldquoIf we come together, there is no limit to what we can achieve. Our future is in our hands.She launched a ferocious assault on Jeremy Corbynrsquos Labour, describing the takeover of the party by the left as ldquoa national tragedy and his policies of nationalisation and shares for workers as ldquobogus solutions that would makes things worse.Theresa May dances as she arrives on stage In a clear pitch for mainstream voters turned off by Mr Corbynrsquos left-wing economic agenda and rows over anti-Semitism, she said she wanted the ldquodecent, moderate and patriotic Conservatives to be ldquoa party for the whole country.She made a grab for traditionally Labour territory by saying that the NHS ldquoembodies our principles as Conservatives and boasting of the presence in the Tory front ranks of immigrantrsquos son Sajid Javid, former Barnardorsquos girl Esther McVey and lesbian mother-to-be Ruth Davidson.In the face of Labourrsquos appeal to those suffering from the effects of austerity, Mrs May said Tories must ldquodefend free markets, because it is ordinary working people who benefit.But she acknowledged that, a decade after the  crash, the after-effects were still being felt by many households.A kiss from husband Philip, after giving her speech ldquoSome markets are still not working in the interests of ordinary people, she said.ldquoEmployment is up but too many people havenrsquot had a decent pay rise. The deficit is down but achieving that has been painful. And our economy is growing but some communities have been left behind.ldquoThis is why some people still feel that our economy isnrsquot working for them.ldquoOur mission as Conservatives must be to show them that we can build an economy that does.She promised to ldquomake markets work in the interests of ordinary people again, citing Government initiatives to toughen corporate governance rules, provide protection for gig economy workers and cap energy prices.And she warned she was ready to take further action against utility firms which punish loyal customers with higher prices.Acknowledging voter weariness with belt-tightening, Mrs May said: ldquoThe British people need to know that the end is in sight.ldquoAnd our message to them must be this ndash We get it. We are not just a party to clean up a mess, we are the party to steer a course to a better future.To applause from activists, she said: ldquoSound finances are essential, but they are not the limit of our ambition.Because you made sacrices, there are better days ahead.So much for TMay claim her Tory values are security, freedom, opportunity. Tory Govt is delivering greater insecurity , undermining freedom destroying opportunities mdash Yvette CooperOctober , Pleased to see Mrs May has finally lted the borrowing cap on councils so they can build more housing. The Conservativesrsquo long-held resistance to this @LibDems policy only deepened the housing crisismdash Vince CableOctober , ldquoSo when wersquove secured a good Brexit deal for Britain, at the spending review next year we will set out our approach for the future.ldquoDebt as a share of the economy will continue to go down, support for public services will go up.ldquoBecause, a decade after the financial crash, people need to know that the austerity it led to is over and that their hard work has paid off.Mrs May received a standing ovation as she concluded her -minute speech with an appeal to Tories: ldquoTogether, letrsquos build a better Britain..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: There are better days ahead  u Theresa May declares end to austerity article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

However in business, things are really moving and the way we do business is evolving at a breath-taking pace.The biggest change we’re seeing is in all things digital. We now adopt new technology quickly and easily because developers are getting better at using a human-first approach to make complex things intuitive. Take contactless payments.Remember how the first few times you waved your debit card at a machine, it was a bit scary and surreal. We’ve rapidly become accustomed to contactless payments and things like Apple Pay. This once futuristic stuff is now common place and it is really transforming how companies transact.Along with these complex advances come the obvious threats of cyber security, the potentially ransomable value of inidual or company data post-GDPR, and the competitive market risks to businesses which aren’t already on their digital game.While we’re seeing a burgeoning community of tech start-ups through both our own Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and a growing number of incubator hubs in Belfast and Derry, as well as impressive numbers of IT jobs created from inward investment, it’s never too late to begin your digital transformation. The thing is,you’re a tech firm, your financial tech needs to be walking the walk too. Increasingly, we’re finding clients placing more emphasis on this in their choice of banking partner, above all .Barclays was the first bank to develop an ATM over  years ago, and the first UK bank to launch a credit card. In more recent years we were among the first to launch contactless cards, and we were the first bank in Northern Ireland to make cheque imaging available to our clients. In the past  years we’ve invested over £bn in new technology which has meant our clients can be sure our digital technology is right up to date. While other banks are now facing a catch-up period of investment and the challenges of upgrading their s, Barclays has the technology already in place. Our personal banking app was recently voted best in the UK, and our small business  allows businesses to access a pre-approved overdraft limit at the touch of a button.  Our award-winning corporate cash management system, Barclays.net, is tried and tested by the % of UK companies which put it through its paces every day.BEYOND NI: EXPORTS AND CONNECTIONS The spotlight is being turned on Northern Ireland’s exporting capabilities, brought into sharper focus by the issue of Brexit. Without doubt, export sales are one of the key opportunities for growing the economy. We are really excited to work with established export businesses like Moy Park at one end of the spectrum and a successful new tech business, Neurovalens, at the other. This start-up began le as one of the first tenants in the Barclays Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and due to growth, has recently moved into its own premises to accommodate its now more than  staff.While access to money is obviously important for business growth, access to our networks can be just as valuable for NI companies. With Barclays’ major presence in the UK and US, our London and New York private equity contacts are opening doors for Northern Ireland firms looking for market intelligence.This style of partnership working with a local banking team, which can link into a well-established international network, is exactly the foot up our companies need to make them competitive in a global economy.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"justin rush taking pride in recruitment","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Anyone that attended the  Belfast Pride Festival would have been bowled over by the number of participants in the parade, the huge crowds of well-wishers who assembled, and the sizeable number and range of employers supporting the event. It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice.

Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners reported a record turnover of £.m for the year to March , . The % rise over the year means turnover at the port has trebled in  years. Pre-tax profits were down % year-on-year, dropping from £m to £.m. Foyle Port chief executive, Brian McGrath, said: “The outstanding corporate performance of the organisation, year on year, demonstrates the in-depth strength of our operational team.” “The port’s location at Lisahally underpins our key position as an Atlantic gateway for the United Kingdom and Europe.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises.
