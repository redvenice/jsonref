With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Princess Michael of Kent (left) prides herself on being both a well-organised and generous hostess. While his wife stands graciously saying ‘hello’ to everyone, Prince Michael minglesThis is the garden that was once Princess Diana’s sanctuary, the only place where she felt entirely secure from Buckingham Palace snoops, and where Prince William took his first public steps.Since taking it over after Diana’s death, Princess Michael, 73, has transformed the place, and the flowerbeds and roses will be at their best for the party on July 2, two days before her husband’s 76th birthday.There is an added ingredient to this summer’s bash — the couple are also celebrating their ruby wedding anniversary on June 30. So there will be special interest in who makes the guest list.The bank holiday getaway heats up!

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/16/4CA5493E00000578-5774789-image-m-31_1527348431493.jpg","title":"Back reality Meghan Markles mother Doria takes dog walk L A","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured on Friday in Los Angeles as she took her dog for a walk       EXCLUSIVE: Coldstream Guard \u0027raped young mother\u0027 in a park...Prince Charles steps out in a trendy pair of shades as he...Share this articleMs Ragland was also the only one of the actress\u0027s relatives who was seen at the wedding last week. She accompanied her in a car to the chapel at Windsor Castle then watched on, blinking away tears, as Meghan and Harry said their vows.    Ms Ragland returned to California this week after accompanying her daughter throughout the weekend in Windsor           Ms Ragland is one of the few members of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family who has not embarrassed her since she became engaged to Prince Harry  Afterwards, in a touching gesture of hospitality after their children tied the knot, Prince Charles accompanied her out of the church and then took her arm on the steps of the chapel to pose for photographs with his own wife, The Duchess of Cornwall. Ms Ragland\u0027s dignified silence about the royal romance is in stark contrast to the headline-grabbing insults thrown around by Meghan\u0027s half-siblings. It also coincides with her father\u0027s staging of paparazzi photographs in Mexico. After the wedding last Saturday, Ms Ragland joined her daughter and hundreds of other guests at a lunch in Windsor Castle.

MailOnline has requested further clarification from his representatives this morning.   Becker, 50, was made bankrupt last summer by a London court over an undisclosed sum he has owed a private bank since 2015. It ordered that his assets be disposed of to meet his debts, leading to speculation that he had squandered a personal fortune once estimated at £100million.According to German newspaper Bild, the 62-acre estate in Majorca – which is on the market for £9,135,000 – has stood empty for the past few years.Fresh turf marks spot where poisoned Russian spy and his...My evil ex tortured and killed her au pair because of me:...Share this articlePictures show its 90ft swimming pool covered in green algae and the lawns around it long and parched. Becker bought the estate with his former wife Barbara in 1997 but has been trying to sell it for a decade. It boasts a main villa, stables, a helicopter pad, four guest houses, staff accommodation and a tennis court made from the same surface used on hard courts at the Australian Open.  Berres says he plans to give the empty £13 million villa near the rural town of Arta in north-east Majorca a new lease of life - and claims to have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property along with his hippie commune friendsA real estate lawyer in the region said it can take two years to clear out squatters.   Berres, thought to be a 44-year-old former carpenter, has moved into the plush home along with a with a number of helper friends.The group, calling themselves the ‘Intergalactic Auxiliary And Rescue Command’– walked through an unlocked gate at the former Wimbledon champion’s holiday home last weekend. Berres said the group see themselves as ‘house-rescuers on behalf of higher powers’, adding: ‘When houses are open, we go in, start to revive everything, to make everything clean. We want to create a lovable place.’  He added: ‘No one has been here for years. But I felt immediately welcome here. This is a real rough diamond that needs to be honed.’He has wasted no time sharing videos of himself wandering through the palatial grounds and sunbathing.          Berres, who moved to Majorca in 2014 and is understood to have lived in several \u0027abandoned\u0027 houses on the island after time in a caravan, told German press he had \u0027big projects\u0027 for the 31,000-square foot propertyFilming himself walking through the now unkempt grounds, Berres says: \u0027It\u0027s like nobody loved this place.\u0027How can it come to this, I ask, that something like this is a habitat for wasps, geckos and spiders. Something\u0027s gone wrong there. Someone\u0027s listened to the wrong advice.\u0027  Becker is said to have earned in the region of £100million throughout his career, but was declared bankrupt in June last year over a £3.3million debt - forcing him to abandon the plush Spanish property.

Not only did he have his own cabin, which cost around £20,000, he was years younger than anyone else on board.Quiet, unassuming and impeccably dressed in tailored chinos, a white safari hat and jacket, he introduced himself as 22-year-old William Baekeland, a British aristocrat and great-grandson of Leo Hendrik Baekeland, the Belgian-born inventor of Bakelite — the precursor to modern plastic.Rumours of this young man’s vast inherited wealth and grand heritage were soon rife, and he was quickly welcomed into the fold.His fellow travellers were so impressed by his status, encyclopaedic geographical knowledge and cut-glass accent it is claimed that they soon began to hand over huge sums of money for private expeditions William promised to organise.Little did they know the young man was not who he claimed to be.

Instead of the homes he claimed to have across the world, including in London and Ireland, he in fact lived with his parents in a £130,000 ex-council house next to a Mecca Bingo hall in the Birmingham suburb of Great Barr.Justice for Helen: Mother demands a change in the law to...\u0027Thank you very much. See you soon. Love you all\u0027: Tragic...Share this articleUntil a few months ago, he managed to keep up this pretence and allegedly convinced dozens to hand over money for expeditions, some of which, to be fair, came to fruition and were declared great successes. But a great many more did not. Now he stands accused of taking £524,000 from 19 people for trips that failed to materialise.Although British police are investigating, few of his victims think they’ll see their money again. Today, there is a lot of anger and embarrassment among this community as to how the wool was pulled over their eyes.So how could this young man, without fame, fortune or ancestry, seemingly manage to hoodwink so many wealthy and experienced travellers into giving him so much money? And how could he keep up the ruse for so long?William, who is now 25, was born Jesse Gordon in Sutton Coldfield in 1993, the eldest of three children (he has two younger sisters, Jasmine, 22, and Grace, 19) of parents Simon Gordon, 62, a railway engineer and Mandy, 53, a housewife.Although his upbringing was relatively modest, he was an exceptionally bright child and obtained a place at King Edward VI Grammar School. Family holidays rarely went beyond Dorset, but from an early age he had a passion for geography and would study maps for hours.Childhood friend Joshua Radcliffe, 25, says: ‘He always wanted to see the world. It was an obsession with him.’          Instead of the homes he claimed to have across the world he in fact lived with his parents in a £130,000 ex-council house next to a Mecca Bingo hall in the Birmingham suburb of Great BarrBut it was not until he finished his degree in international politics and economics at Aberystwyth University in 2014 that William —who officially changed his name from Jesse to William Baekeland in the same year — began to seriously travel.Using a small inheritance from his grandparents, he bought a ticket on the Ortelius and set sail in March 2015, just days after celebrating his 22nd birthday. This was his debut into the community of extreme travellers, who he beguiled with tales of how he could pilot planes and the 100-plus countries he claimed to have visited already.And as they made the long journey together across icy waters, William revealed his plans for future expeditions, including a circumnavigation of Antartica. He depicted himself as a travel fixer, an explorer who could co-ordinate trips to the most far-flung and inhospitable places, with no expense spared for chartered yachts and security teams.Dominique Laurent, 67, a retired French financier and oil executive who has travelled to more than 170 countries, was a fellow passenger on this trip. He took in every word. ‘He looked like quite a wealthy guy although he was very young,’ he recalls. ‘I was very impressed by his knowledge.’Another passenger was British-Greek travel writer Harry Mitsidis, 46, one of only a handful of explorers to have visited every country in the world. By coincidence — and probably to William’s horror — the pair’s paths had crossed in 2013 when William, while still at university, had applied for an internship on Mr Mitsidis’s website. He was using the name Simon Baekeland.Although they’d they never met in person — the job was carried out remotely — subsequent checks by Harry into the intern’s CV revealed he had lied about his education, claiming to have attended the £17,000-a-year Harrodian school in London.He also said he had studied in North Korea for a month, as well as at exclusive international schools in Switzerland and Monaco. Needless to say, Harry ended William’s internship and did not hear from him again until he spotted him on the Ortelius.He says initially William went out of his way to avoid him, but with so much time together onboard (only 24 hours of the trip were ashore) they ended up talking. When Harry asked why William was no longer called Simon, he explained this was his middle name.Bowled over by his charm and geographical knowledge, Harry quietened his suspicions and put the CV discrepancies down to the different first name. ‘William could quote places like Kapingamarangi (an atoll of Micronesia). It goes beyond geek quirk — no one knows this kind of thing. We were all impressed and there was no questioning his legitimacy. He also had a very clear and upper crust English accent and you would think “Wow, this guy sounds like royalty”.‘He was sociable, too, and would come to dinner — what surprised me was the ease with which he conversed with people three times his age. We were partially dealing with a genius who was able to plan and execute behaviour in a precise way in order to achieve his goal. There was great attention to detail.’          William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the PacificWilliam’s choice of the Baekeland name, for example, was most likely meticulously researched. Although it is associated with the creation of Bakelite, it has a dark past, chronicled in the book and 2007 film, Savage Grace, starring Julianne Moore and Eddie Redmayne.This tells the story of Barbara Daly, the wife of Leo Baekeland’s grandson Brooks, who was murdered by her son Tony in 1972 after she had tried to ‘save him’ from his homosexuality by seducing him.In the face of such scandal, William told his enthralled travelling companions, he didn’t like talking about his personal life, and there was no information about his family online because they’d paid Google to delete the results.With contacts made and cash deposits taken for future trips, the cruise was a success and William began the next stage in his plan.He posted photographs on an Instagram account of his travels to exotic places, as well as pictures of him flying first class and in chartered planes and helicopters.In September 2016, he was interviewed for a podcast called Counting Countries, where he said he had visited 154 countries and recounted false tales of childhood expeditions. ‘We went on safaris quite a lot, we went to East Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia...we also went to the Congo.’ There was no mention of the family holidays to Dorset.Over the next year, William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the Pacific, and another to the sub-Antarctic Marion and Prince Edward Islands.In February 2017, he organised a trip for four people, including Dominique, to the remote Clipperton Island in the Pacific, for which Dominique paid £10,000. Three months later, he paid another £10,000 for a visit to the Central African Republic, which was a similarly small group tour. Both worked out well. ‘Our rate of confidence in him was 100 per cent afterwards,’ says Dominique.His reputation boosted by these successes, William continued to take orders, but by the autumn of 2017, trips started to fail to materialise. His explanations were typically outlandish. In a newsletter emailed to disappointed travellers following the cancellation of a trip to the Desventuradas Islands off the coast of Chile, he fabricated a story that his sisters, whom he called Muguette and Ariadne, had died from cancer and ‘weariness of life’ respectively.His mother, Lady Violette, he said, had travelled first class to the funeral in New York and paid for a separate seat for his sister’s teddy bear. He said they were buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery, the same one where Leo Baekeland lies.In September, Dominique learned that William had failed to show up for a planned trip to South Sudan, reportedly stranding a Russian traveller who had paid £20,000. In an email sent by his ‘assistant’, William claimed he had been detained at Heathrow Airport.News of this ‘no show’ spread fast but Dominique and others weren’t worried. They were expecting to see him at a travel conference in Serbia a few weeks later. But again, William didn’t turn up. Then, a visit to Mali, which Dominique thankfully was not booked on, was suddenly cancelled. To date there has been no mention of a refund.          William posted this picture on Instagram at the camel market of El Fasher in Darfur, SudanPeople started communicating with each other about the tours they had booked with William and it is believed there were at least ten trips scheduled, from November 2017 to early 2019 — including the one he first planned on the Ortelius, the ‘irresistible’ South Antarctic circumnavigation.In total, Dominique claims he is owed £45,000 for expeditions including South Sudan, Somalia, Equatorial Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo which so far have not happened, and there is no suggestion that they will happen.With hindsight, Dominique says: ‘He was very cunning to be able to infiltrate an elite group of travellers and play the long game. I feel cheated. I’ve been travelling for decades and thought I was a good judge of character.‘There was also the feeling of frustration over not being able to visit those countries he said he was going to take us to.’ Dominique has reported what happened to the British police, but feels they did not take him very seriously.As for Harry, he was determined to get to the bottom of the story. He turned investigator and found no record of William’s birth in Britain, but instead a Jesse Simon Gordon with the same date of birth, who had registered and dissolved a travel company.Harry remembered he had received emails from someone of this name years ago, enquiring about expeditions. He then found a photograph of him on his sister’s Facebook account, and the penny dropped. ‘He was just an ordinary guy, with an ordinary family, from the suburbs of Birmingham, who it seems has managed to pull off an incredibly sophisticated act.’Furious, in November last year, Harry — who says he is owed almost £26,000 — sent an email to around 100 fellow travellers revealing William’s true identity, entitled ‘Apocalypse now, a bomb in our travel community’. He never heard from William again.But where is William Baekeland, aka Jesse Gordon, today?His family still lives in the same three-bedroom house in Birmingham, where William is said to be a regular visitor.His parents have refused to comment publicly, although his sister, Jasmine, told one newspaper how their ‘normal working-class parents’ had always believed their son to be a stockbroker in London.‘We are not particularly wealthy. We always stayed in England for our holidays. He was always travelling for months at a time and we did not understand how he could afford it,’ she said.Jasmine’s fiance, 22-year-old civil engineer Dylan Walton, was more scathing: ‘I don’t like him as he thinks he’s better than everyone else. But I can’t take away from him his genius. He’s got an amazing memory for all sorts of facts, trivia, history and geography. It’s just scandalous the stories he’s made up.          The \u0027baby-faced conman\u0027 is pictured here visiting the world\u0027s highest lake in Nepal‘When his parents found out he’d changed his name, he said it was because he was working for a secret Government agency. And for some reason, they just believe all his lies. He’s their golden boy.‘He loves the upper-class lifestyle and I always wondered where he was getting the money from.’For now, William is lying low and refusing to speak publicly about what happened, instead using his friend Joshua, with whom he set up a travel company last year — a separate venture to anything involved with this current debacle — as his spokesman.Joshua says: ‘I think he got a bit ahead of himself. He flew too close to the sun, he started to organise trips costing £40,000 to £50,000 instead of £3,000 to £4,000. If you pay so much for a chartered yacht and then don’t sell enough tickets, you lose the deposit.‘He should have been more upfront about his background, then he could’ve explained the situation.

He had to have an urgent operation and remained at the vet’s for five days.’Two years later it happened again, spontaneously. ‘The vet told us it would probably keep happening — there was obviously an underlying problem. Each time we were looking at £3,000 for an operation plus £1,000 for physio. The insurance wouldn’t pay out because it was a pre-existing condition.More importantly, could we keep putting Dylan through all that? The pain and surgery?‘The vet said we should consider putting him to sleep. It was an awful, awful time. Dylan’s so cheeky, extremely loyal, and losing him was unthinkable.’It was then that Nicci recalled how a friend’s Alsatian had been helped by a healer called Clyde Hughes.‘I wasn’t convinced — we were talking about a dog needing major spinal surgery — but my partner, Phil, said “What have we got to lose?”’ By the time they got to the clinic, Dylan had deteriorated. ‘He was looking at me as if to say, “Mum, give me a break!” and lying on the floor, unable to move. It was unbearable. ‘Clyde put a crystal either side of Dylan and ran a ining rod — like a wooden wand — over him. He put his hands on Dylan, saying there was a blockage in his energy in his back and he was channelling lots of good energy.

Love you all\u0027: Tragic...Share this articleUntil a few months ago, he managed to keep up this pretence and allegedly convinced dozens to hand over money for expeditions, some of which, to be fair, came to fruition and were declared great successes. But a great many more did not. Now he stands accused of taking £524,000 from 19 people for trips that failed to materialise.Although British police are investigating, few of his victims think they’ll see their money again. Today, there is a lot of anger and embarrassment among this community as to how the wool was pulled over their eyes.So how could this young man, without fame, fortune or ancestry, seemingly manage to hoodwink so many wealthy and experienced travellers into giving him so much money? And how could he keep up the ruse for so long?William, who is now 25, was born Jesse Gordon in Sutton Coldfield in 1993, the eldest of three children (he has two younger sisters, Jasmine, 22, and Grace, 19) of parents Simon Gordon, 62, a railway engineer and Mandy, 53, a housewife.Although his upbringing was relatively modest, he was an exceptionally bright child and obtained a place at King Edward VI Grammar School. Family holidays rarely went beyond Dorset, but from an early age he had a passion for geography and would study maps for hours.Childhood friend Joshua Radcliffe, 25, says: ‘He always wanted to see the world. It was an obsession with him.’          Instead of the homes he claimed to have across the world he in fact lived with his parents in a £130,000 ex-council house next to a Mecca Bingo hall in the Birmingham suburb of Great BarrBut it was not until he finished his degree in international politics and economics at Aberystwyth University in 2014 that William —who officially changed his name from Jesse to William Baekeland in the same year — began to seriously travel.Using a small inheritance from his grandparents, he bought a ticket on the Ortelius and set sail in March 2015, just days after celebrating his 22nd birthday. This was his debut into the community of extreme travellers, who he beguiled with tales of how he could pilot planes and the 100-plus countries he claimed to have visited already.And as they made the long journey together across icy waters, William revealed his plans for future expeditions, including a circumnavigation of Antartica. He depicted himself as a travel fixer, an explorer who could co-ordinate trips to the most far-flung and inhospitable places, with no expense spared for chartered yachts and security teams.Dominique Laurent, 67, a retired French financier and oil executive who has travelled to more than 170 countries, was a fellow passenger on this trip. He took in every word. ‘He looked like quite a wealthy guy although he was very young,’ he recalls. ‘I was very impressed by his knowledge.’Another passenger was British-Greek travel writer Harry Mitsidis, 46, one of only a handful of explorers to have visited every country in the world. By coincidence — and probably to William’s horror — the pair’s paths had crossed in 2013 when William, while still at university, had applied for an internship on Mr Mitsidis’s website. He was using the name Simon Baekeland.Although they’d they never met in person — the job was carried out remotely — subsequent checks by Harry into the intern’s CV revealed he had lied about his education, claiming to have attended the £17,000-a-year Harrodian school in London.He also said he had studied in North Korea for a month, as well as at exclusive international schools in Switzerland and Monaco. Needless to say, Harry ended William’s internship and did not hear from him again until he spotted him on the Ortelius.He says initially William went out of his way to avoid him, but with so much time together onboard (only 24 hours of the trip were ashore) they ended up talking. When Harry asked why William was no longer called Simon, he explained this was his middle name.Bowled over by his charm and geographical knowledge, Harry quietened his suspicions and put the CV discrepancies down to the different first name. ‘William could quote places like Kapingamarangi (an atoll of Micronesia). It goes beyond geek quirk — no one knows this kind of thing. We were all impressed and there was no questioning his legitimacy. He also had a very clear and upper crust English accent and you would think “Wow, this guy sounds like royalty”.‘He was sociable, too, and would come to dinner — what surprised me was the ease with which he conversed with people three times his age. We were partially dealing with a genius who was able to plan and execute behaviour in a precise way in order to achieve his goal. There was great attention to detail.’          William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the PacificWilliam’s choice of the Baekeland name, for example, was most likely meticulously researched. Although it is associated with the creation of Bakelite, it has a dark past, chronicled in the book and 2007 film, Savage Grace, starring Julianne Moore and Eddie Redmayne.This tells the story of Barbara Daly, the wife of Leo Baekeland’s grandson Brooks, who was murdered by her son Tony in 1972 after she had tried to ‘save him’ from his homosexuality by seducing him.In the face of such scandal, William told his enthralled travelling companions, he didn’t like talking about his personal life, and there was no information about his family online because they’d paid Google to delete the results.With contacts made and cash deposits taken for future trips, the cruise was a success and William began the next stage in his plan.He posted photographs on an Instagram account of his travels to exotic places, as well as pictures of him flying first class and in chartered planes and helicopters.In September 2016, he was interviewed for a podcast called Counting Countries, where he said he had visited 154 countries and recounted false tales of childhood expeditions. ‘We went on safaris quite a lot, we went to East Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia...we also went to the Congo.’ There was no mention of the family holidays to Dorset.Over the next year, William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the Pacific, and another to the sub-Antarctic Marion and Prince Edward Islands.In February 2017, he organised a trip for four people, including Dominique, to the remote Clipperton Island in the Pacific, for which Dominique paid £10,000. Three months later, he paid another £10,000 for a visit to the Central African Republic, which was a similarly small group tour. Both worked out well. ‘Our rate of confidence in him was 100 per cent afterwards,’ says Dominique.His reputation boosted by these successes, William continued to take orders, but by the autumn of 2017, trips started to fail to materialise. His explanations were typically outlandish. In a newsletter emailed to disappointed travellers following the cancellation of a trip to the Desventuradas Islands off the coast of Chile, he fabricated a story that his sisters, whom he called Muguette and Ariadne, had died from cancer and ‘weariness of life’ respectively.His mother, Lady Violette, he said, had travelled first class to the funeral in New York and paid for a separate seat for his sister’s teddy bear. He said they were buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery, the same one where Leo Baekeland lies.In September, Dominique learned that William had failed to show up for a planned trip to South Sudan, reportedly stranding a Russian traveller who had paid £20,000. In an email sent by his ‘assistant’, William claimed he had been detained at Heathrow Airport.News of this ‘no show’ spread fast but Dominique and others weren’t worried. They were expecting to see him at a travel conference in Serbia a few weeks later. But again, William didn’t turn up. Then, a visit to Mali, which Dominique thankfully was not booked on, was suddenly cancelled. To date there has been no mention of a refund.          William posted this picture on Instagram at the camel market of El Fasher in Darfur, SudanPeople started communicating with each other about the tours they had booked with William and it is believed there were at least ten trips scheduled, from November 2017 to early 2019 — including the one he first planned on the Ortelius, the ‘irresistible’ South Antarctic circumnavigation.In total, Dominique claims he is owed £45,000 for expeditions including South Sudan, Somalia, Equatorial Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo which so far have not happened, and there is no suggestion that they will happen.With hindsight, Dominique says: ‘He was very cunning to be able to infiltrate an elite group of travellers and play the long game. I feel cheated. I’ve been travelling for decades and thought I was a good judge of character.‘There was also the feeling of frustration over not being able to visit those countries he said he was going to take us to.’ Dominique has reported what happened to the British police, but feels they did not take him very seriously.As for Harry, he was determined to get to the bottom of the story. He turned investigator and found no record of William’s birth in Britain, but instead a Jesse Simon Gordon with the same date of birth, who had registered and dissolved a travel company.Harry remembered he had received emails from someone of this name years ago, enquiring about expeditions. He then found a photograph of him on his sister’s Facebook account, and the penny dropped. ‘He was just an ordinary guy, with an ordinary family, from the suburbs of Birmingham, who it seems has managed to pull off an incredibly sophisticated act.’Furious, in November last year, Harry — who says he is owed almost £26,000 — sent an email to around 100 fellow travellers revealing William’s true identity, entitled ‘Apocalypse now, a bomb in our travel community’. He never heard from William again.But where is William Baekeland, aka Jesse Gordon, today?His family still lives in the same three-bedroom house in Birmingham, where William is said to be a regular visitor.His parents have refused to comment publicly, although his sister, Jasmine, told one newspaper how their ‘normal working-class parents’ had always believed their son to be a stockbroker in London.‘We are not particularly wealthy. We always stayed in England for our holidays. He was always travelling for months at a time and we did not understand how he could afford it,’ she said.Jasmine’s fiance, 22-year-old civil engineer Dylan Walton, was more scathing: ‘I don’t like him as he thinks he’s better than everyone else. But I can’t take away from him his genius. He’s got an amazing memory for all sorts of facts, trivia, history and geography. It’s just scandalous the stories he’s made up.          The \u0027baby-faced conman\u0027 is pictured here visiting the world\u0027s highest lake in Nepal‘When his parents found out he’d changed his name, he said it was because he was working for a secret Government agency. And for some reason, they just believe all his lies. He’s their golden boy.‘He loves the upper-class lifestyle and I always wondered where he was getting the money from.’For now, William is lying low and refusing to speak publicly about what happened, instead using his friend Joshua, with whom he set up a travel company last year — a separate venture to anything involved with this current debacle — as his spokesman.Joshua says: ‘I think he got a bit ahead of himself. He flew too close to the sun, he started to organise trips costing £40,000 to £50,000 instead of £3,000 to £4,000. If you pay so much for a chartered yacht and then don’t sell enough tickets, you lose the deposit.‘He should have been more upfront about his background, then he could’ve explained the situation. These are wealthy, entitled people who have looked to paint it all in a sinister light and I think it’s unfair. He will pay the money back.’A spokesman for City of London police, who investigate fraud, say they have received complaints against William and that this information has been ‘disseminated by our National Fraud Intelligence Bureau to West Midlands Police.’No action has yet been taken and for all those who say they have lost out, it remains to be seen whether they will ever see their money again. Whether we’ll see William Baekeland — and what guise he’ll take when he does emerge — also remains to be seen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/00/4CB6569000000578-5780735-Kishan_Takahashi_pictured_with_dog_Bonnie_who_had_treatment_for_-a-14_1527549037371.jpg","title":"Magical healers cured pets vets written off","story":"    Thomas the cat pictured with Clyde Hughes who also treated Dylan the dog.

In February, the Mail revealed how healer Avril Priestley had stunned vets by curing her dog Ella this way after a diagnosis of terminal bone cancer.But until a few years ago, if you’d asked Nicci, an NHS bereavement counsellor and patient liaison officer, whether she believed in it, she’d have laughed. Now, as the sound of a healthy Dylan playing with his squeaky toys fills her home every day, she’s a convert.          Kishan Takahashi pictured with dog Bonnie who had treatment for abdominal disorder The problem began when he was three and injured himself playing with some other dogs.‘I didn’t see how it happened but he took to his bed and wouldn’t move or eat,’ says Nicci, a mother-of-two from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire. ‘His disc had burst and it had trapped his spinal cord. He had to have an urgent operation and remained at the vet’s for five days.’Two years later it happened again, spontaneously. ‘The vet told us it would probably keep happening — there was obviously an underlying problem. Each time we were looking at £3,000 for an operation plus £1,000 for physio. The insurance wouldn’t pay out because it was a pre-existing condition.More importantly, could we keep putting Dylan through all that? The pain and surgery?‘The vet said we should consider putting him to sleep. It was an awful, awful time. Dylan’s so cheeky, extremely loyal, and losing him was unthinkable.’It was then that Nicci recalled how a friend’s Alsatian had been helped by a healer called Clyde Hughes.‘I wasn’t convinced — we were talking about a dog needing major spinal surgery — but my partner, Phil, said “What have we got to lose?”’ By the time they got to the clinic, Dylan had deteriorated. ‘He was looking at me as if to say, “Mum, give me a break!” and lying on the floor, unable to move. It was unbearable. ‘Clyde put a crystal either side of Dylan and ran a ining rod — like a wooden wand — over him. He put his hands on Dylan, saying there was a blockage in his energy in his back and he was channelling lots of good energy.

They have no values beyond money-grubbing and treat anyone who gets in their way with contempt.’Blackstone’s billionaire co-founder and chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, trousered a scarcely credible £572.4 million last year alone.His company tried to sell St Katharine Docks for £435 million in 2017, three years after acquiring it for £185 million.

There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last.

I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

In a military town outside Seoul, where she lived aged 11, many of the trees had been cut down for fuel, while, under the dictator Park Chung-Hee’s modernisation programme, new roads were begun and abandoned. The inhabitants of her neighbourhood’s cheap and fragile houses came and went: soldiers, farmers who worked the fields surrounding the haphazard development, and “wanderers”, such as Bul’s parents. They were leftwing activists whose home was routinely searched by the police for banned books and needed to live in a place where people weren’t too fussy about their neighbours.While the world outside was dry, however, home was a Technicolor Oz. As political dissidents, her parents couldn’t attend group gatherings, even at work. Compelled to labour from home, sometimes with neighbours, her mother made handbags from glass beads. “There was another landscape inside our house,” she recalls. “One room with women working with beautiful colours.”As origin stories go, it’s a setting worthy of the dystopian fiction Bul has long channelled in her art: sci-fi movie-spectacular sculptures and installations powered by utopian dreams and social critique. Her forthcoming mid-career survey at the Hayward Gallery in London will trace how, over the past three decades, she has established herself at the forefront of South Korean art. When we meet at the gallery a few weeks before the opening, there are cyborg babes and multi-limbed monsters hanging from the ceiling. Mirrors wrapped in cellophane lean against walls, waiting to be assembled into luminous labyrinths. Technicians are tinkering inside a high-gloss black hunk of hollow mountain that looks like a panic room for Darth Vader, but is dedicated to the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin. Throughout it all, Bul examines our flawed pursuit of perfection, be it improving our bodies, or remaking society. There’s a striking push and pull between the gorgeous and grotesque. Get up close to the darkly glittering skin of a mutant octopus creation, and you see that its sequins are matted with plant life, like something washed up in a drain.Bul thinks the strange contrasts of her formative years are central to her approach they have clearly engendered a strong ironic streak in her work. She has a formative childhood memory of lovers riding a motorbike that crashed into a bakery, in a smash of blood and cake. “That was a beautiful accident,” she laughs throatily.Her work is now highly crafted, with expensive production values. It’s a universe away from when she started out. This was 1980s Korea, where protesters faced torture, and she was working within a fledgling contemporary art scene with few international influences. “There were no role models. I had to create,” she says.Her traditional art school was a disappointment, but discovering the postwar theatre of the absurd inspired Bul to break free. Her first notable work was in 1989 a performance called Abortion, a shocking mix of real and fake. Having distributed sweets to her audience, Bul hung upside down and nude, recounting her experiences of abortion, which was then illegal, while recreating something of its physical agony. Eventually, her onlookers took action and cut the ropes: “They never thought it was theatre. It was a real body and a real situation.”The following year she took her unruly, boundary-breaking physicality to the street. Hanging from the Hayward’s rafters is a meaty, lobster-orange mutant fat suit, fingers and limbs sprouting from its fleshy folds. It’s huge – photographs can’t really convey what it must have taken the diminutive artist to don it, take a flight to Tokyo, and head downtown. “Of course, they didn’t want me on the plane,” she chuckles. “Finally, they said it’s too big and I would need two seats.” What impressed Bul, though, was how, in Tokyo, when prohibited from entering a temple because of the suit, a crowd had argued for her right to wear what she wanted: “They were thinking about human rights. It expanded my subject.” Bul’s body politics and her insistence on her presence as a woman seem especially remarkable in a society as notoriously patriarchal as Korea’s: until 2005, men were legally heads of households. However, she says that her own experiences were not so bad, for one particular reason. “People were scared of me and thought I was a crazy woman. Of course, if I didn’t use this character, then it would probably have been very difficult.” She adds, “I know so many great women artists in Korea because, when women want to be an artist they have to sacrifice everything. It’s art alone for them, so they are very, very strong.” It was after Majestic Splendor that Bul began to think about the cyborgs that would really establish her as an international star. In the 1990s they were a hot topic for writers such as William Gibson and a strong presence in manga, as cartoonishly sexualised women. Bul was one of the first to pull these creatures of sci-fi subculture into contemporary art, in a way that pointed to their age-old cultural roots. Bul’s floating marble-white cyborgs have the elevated position and missing limbs of classical sculptures, a nod to our shifting ideals of beauty and imperfection. What really fascinated her, though, was what cyborgs implied about our efforts to self-improve, in this case with technology. Thinking back to Frankenstein’s monster, she says: “We try to pursue perfection, fail, get scared and call it a monster. And still we try, because that’s our human destiny.” Bul refers to her many-tendrilled Anagram sculptures, a mash-up of insect, plant and sea-life resembling a genetic experiment gone badly wrong, as her voluptuous cyborg’s “doppelgangers”.As a child in the military town, from her house with a paper-thin door, Bul would dream about a bunker-like hideout on a mountainside. In recent years, her focus has shifted from the body to the built environment – another kind of protective skin. This includes fashioning glittering chandelier-like sculptures inspired by the modernist architect Bruno Taut’s fantasy mountaintop glass buildings and coffin-like, one-person karaoke pods that recall the 1960s architecture collective Archigram’s Living Pod. These failed or unrealised architectural dreams are a not-so distant echo of the rapid urban development South Korea was subjected to under the dictatorship, Bul says, with “fast-built cement structures and clean surfaces, but which were likely to collapse”. Disaster is never far away in her work, such as a new installation that refers to the 2014 sinking of the Sewol ferry, in which hundreds died. Yet Bul says she doesn’t want to criticise the impulse to dream big. “This is all about human desire, and desire is our destiny. I don’t want to judge it, but I want to see it more clearly if possible.”Bul’s work knowingly embraces the human urge to attempt impossible tasks. First, there’s the relentless drive to perfect the world, even as history teaches us such ambitions are doomed. Then there’s the challenge of understanding why we do it. One particularly telling work, Via Negative II, is inspired by psychologist Julian Jaynes, who proposed that early man misinterpreted thoughts from the right side of the brain as voices from the gods. It’s a mirrored maze where you encounter infinite reflections of yourself. “I’m trying to question the modern human with a modern mind, and I can’t find the answer,” Bul says. “My labyrinth is in two halves. In one, it’s hard to exit. The other is always open. You can escape any time. That’s my dream.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f2db7d573521cc8a3e9a77bb45fb7dcf27ce10/0_35_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6817482fd8ae2e71dce31838129536","title":"peter kays car share reaches end of the road","story":"Resisting the drive towards sentimentality, Kay delivers a high achievement in 21st century TV comedyThree years and 12 TV half-hours ago, supermarket assistant manager John Redmond (Peter Kay) first gave sales rep colleague Kayleigh Kitson (Sian Gibson) a lift to work as part of their company’s carshare scheme. On Monday at 10.29pm, their flirtatious friendship, as stop-start as the Lancashire traffic they negotiate in morning and evening rush hours, was finally resolved in what the BBC1 continuity announcer billled as the “final ever episode” of Peter Kay’s Car Share.Kay, a proper scholar of TV comedy, knows that the one of the biggest decisions in a sitcom is how far the show departs from the central situation. There’s a tension for viewers in threat that the successful set-up will be jettisoned. With typical sophistication, Kay and co-star Gibson (who have written the series with Paul Coleman and Tim Reid) played with various deviations from the series’ dominating shot of the two retail employees seat-belted in the front of John’s red Fiat 500L, with its WR62 XDF plate.For the first 10 minutes, the passenger seat beside John was empty, a consequence of the row between the couple at the end of the second series, screened in May 2017.Kayleigh was now commuting solo by bus and train. The show kept teasing about whether it would deliver the generally desired romantic clincher that fans have been demanding (100,000 signed a petition) after an apparent Richard Curtis-like ending to season two, with John finally declaring his passion for Kayleigh in a traffic jam, turned out to have been one of the series’ periodic fantasy sequences.Another Curtisian touch – a love song (“Come back, my car share buddy!”) recorded by John and delivered at dawn on a Walkman to Kayleigh’s house, got them back in tandem in the Fiat a third of the way in. John’s rationale for giving things a go with Kayleigh was, fittingly, that “you make me laugh.” But rows and then the road accident of which the storyline has always carried the possibility tantalised with the possibility of another unhappy ending, until, in a satisfying twist on the show’s central visual image, the lovers had to have their first official cuddle on a bus.Making viewers wait and sweat for the ending they desired confirmed the suspicion that Kay, like his character, resists the drive towards sentimentality that the audience desires. The first half of the two-part finale, an unscripted and non-sequential special shown on 7 May, had exposed a comedy that is generally gentle (except for occasional swearing that gives the DVD releases a 15 certificate) to significant controversy for the first time. Some viewers objected to a conversation in which John and Kayleigh reacted satirically to the playing of a request for a transgender man on Forever FM.No such Twitter-storm threatened the final episode, but there was evidence of a wish to keep some edge. The signature punctuating cutaways of north-west urban life and the witlessly optimistic drivel on the car radio of the drivetime presenters on the fictional Forever FM were more consistently filthy than ever before, as if to add some salt to the sugar of the conclusion. Glimpsed from the vehicle were signs warning against “dogging” and an advertising hoarding on which the line “don’t drive like a” was followed by a picture of a cockerel. The radio ads included come-ons for a drink called “love juice” and a “name the year” quiz had a saucy gag about Monica Lewinsky.There was also a hint of in-jokes. John had two speeches about his desire for “privacy”, a right that Kay, who controls media access more than most celebrities, fiercely protects for himself. And a final sub-plot, in which the couple had both been invited to the December 28 wedding of workmates Donna and Rick, seemed designed to lay down the tantalising basis for a Christmas special at some point in the future.A significant television event in any case, the final episode has also taken on an exaggerated significance in Kay’s career. This was a rare example of a TV departure also being a comeback, as this is the first Kay work to be seen since he cancelled for what have been described only as “unforeseen family reasons” a fourteen-month UK stand-up comedy tour that was due to begin last month. If the original plans had stood, the early gigs would have been a warm-up for the last look at Car Share now the latter was a compensation for the loss of seeing the former.With Kay apparently on sabbatical at the moment, it’s impossible to know what he might do next. But Car Share will stand as one of the highest achievements of 21st century TV comedy, containing a combination of warmth and cleverness, social observation and romance, originality and nods to TV comedy history that only Kay could achieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f997f82a21aaffa358df987f3c0e877b5aa02d/0_340_5095_3057/master/5095.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=392c39dbe88e589b4d763bf9a158246d","title":"oxford and cambridge university colleges hold 21bn in riches","story":" study reveals how wealth of nearly 70 colleges is held in estates, endowments and artworksBritain’s ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge have access to a staggering pool of wealth totalling almost £21bn, analysis by the  has revealed.Using a combination of freedom of information requests and audited accounts to piece together the estates, endowments, investments and other assets – including artworks and antiques – held by nearly 70 colleges and institutions shows the full extent of Oxbridge’s remarkable wealth.Oxbridge’s total of at least £21bn is far beyond those of other British universities, and more than the combined investments of the other 22 members of the Russell Group of elite research universities, such as University College London.The scale of Oxford and Cambridge’s affluence, built up over hundreds of years, is such that their assets could pay the tuition fees of every home and international student at UK universities and colleges for a year – and still leave £3bn to spare.Trinity College, Cambridge, is the wealthiest of the inidual colleges with published assets worth £1.3bn in its latest accounts. In Oxford, St John’s College tops the table with close to £600m in assets.The concentration of accumulated reserves of wealth in the hands of just two institutions raises questions over their slow progress in reforming their admissions processes, as well as casting doubt on Oxbridge’s insistence that its expensive tutorial system of teaching undergraduates is underfunded by student tuition fees.Oxford last week published details of its undergraduate intake, in an effort in highlight the progress it has made in recruiting students from erse backgrounds. But the university admitted that it “still has more work to do in attracting the most talented students from all backgrounds”.Earlier this year Louise Richardson, vice chancellor of the University of Oxford, defended the university’s efforts by pointing out that the university spends £17m a year on outreach activities and financial support.David Lammy, the Labour MP who has been a vocal critic of Oxbridge’s admissions failures, said some of the universities’ vast wealth could be put to better use in funding sophisticated access and outreach programmes.“Why are Oxbridge colleges not spending even a tiny sliver of this wealth on foundation years to improve access for under-represented students?” Lammy said.“Why are colleges relying on undergraduate students to run outreach and access programmes instead of employing experienced professionals to go out to under-represented and disadvantaged areas to find the most talented students, regardless of their background?“There can be no more excuses or passing the buck. With such a vast amount of wealth at their disposal I simply fail to see how it is tenable for Oxbridge colleges to continue to pay lip service to access and dedicate such a tiny proportion of their wealth to improving access.”But college bursars spoken to by the  said that while the totals may look impressive, in many cases colleges were heavily circumscribed in how they could use the returns or the assets themselves. In some cases the funds were reserved for specified purposes, such as funding fellowships or student support, with conditions set by donors centuries beforehand.Many of the more venerable colleges, such as Christ Church, Oxford, or King’s College, Cambridge, also faced considerable costs in maintaining their ancient buildings and grounds. Cambridge university declined to comment. A spokesperson for Oxford said the university and its colleges had built up reserves to help maintain its high academic standards. “The university and colleges use their assets to support research, fund teaching and make an Oxford education affordable and accessible for students of all backgrounds,” Oxford said in a statement.“Many reserves are held for specific reasons and for our long-term sustainability. It is simply not the case that we have large unused funds immediately available for general spending. “We are in an uncertain time for higher education funding and it is important to maintain and build reserves to ensure the university’s resilience against future challenges.“The assets underpinning our unrestricted reserves include libraries and other university student resources which could not be sold off without irreparably damaging our academic mission.”The financial advantage enjoyed by Oxford and Cambridge over their domestic rivals is set to widen even further. In the last two years the pair have used their high credit ratings and international reputations to issue bonds worth hundreds of millions of pounds on the capital markets.Last December Oxford raised £750m after issuing a bond to be repaid in 100 years’ time, while Cambridge has this month announced plans to raise a further £600m by issuing bonds to take advantage of low interest rates. That tranche of debt follows Cambridge’s £350m bond issue in 2016, used to finance large-scale property developments in north Cambridge.The figures also reveal how Oxbridge has continued to build on its inherited wealth. The 2002-2003 accounts for Oxford’s colleges showed combined assets of more than £1.6bn. Some 15 years of investments and fundraising later, the 2017 accounts suggest that figure has risen to £5.8bn.Cambridge leads the way with consolidated net assets worth nearly £11.8bn across the university and its colleges – which equates to £390,000 per head for each of its 30,000 students and staff.Despite Cambridge’s colleges alone sitting on assets worth just under £7bn, Queens’ College remains the only one accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, which currently sets the UK living wage at £8.75 an hour. Oxford does better with 12 colleges currently accredited.While the published figures are high, the true extent of Oxbridge’s wealth is likely to be even higher.Many colleges do not place a value on their historic main sites, which date as far back as the 13th century and sprawl across the cities of Oxford and Cambridge. And many of the wealthiest colleges do not account for “heritage assets” such as works of art, libraries or artefacts, whose value many college accounts describe as “immaterial”.The prized possessions of Oxford and Cambridge include Samuel Pepys’s diaries, a Sumerian clay tablet dating to 2,200 BC, the original manuscripts of AA Milne’s Winnie-the-Pooh, and Isaac Newton’s Principia mathematica. Oxford’s museum, the Ashmolean, has drawings by Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, and paintings by Picasso, Constable, Titian and Turner, as well as a Straarius violin. There are even rumours that the mummified head of Oliver Cromwell is buried beneath the chapel of Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. Cambridge’s Trinity College – which counts Isaac Newton, Vladimir Nabokov and Lord Byron as among its former students – with assets of £1.34bn amassed over nearly 500 years, is wealthier than all UK universities other than Manchester, Edinburgh and Imperial College London.Trinity’s net assets have grown by nearly £160m in the space of a year in its most recent accounts – more than Oxford’s Balliol College has accumulated over 750 years. Trinity’s huge £563m investment fund recently included shares in the world’s largest arms companies, several partners in the Dakota Access pipeline, and Arconic, the supplier of the notorious cladding on Grenfell Tower.Not all colleges are privy to immense swaths of wealth and there is a huge disparity between the richest and the poorest. The £32m assets of Cambridge’s Clare Hall College pale into insignificance against those of Trinity and its neighbour, King’s College, which has assets of £350m, including the £748,000 it received in annual literary royalties, including from the estate of the novelist EM Forster.Cambridge has taken steps to address its own imbalances by operating the Colleges Fund, which requires the richer colleges to provide financial support to poorer colleges. Last year, St Edmund’s College supplemented its relatively meagre assets of £39m with £735,000 granted by the fund, while Trinity College made the biggest contributions with £2.3m.Oxford also runs an equalisation fund to provide some support from the wealthiest colleges to their less well-off peers. But college bursars complain that the richest colleges undervalue or obscure their assets in order to restrain their contributions.Despite their enormous wealth, the Oxbridge colleges courted controversy earlier this year after backing revisions to the main university staff pension scheme that would have led to staff across the UK seeing diminished pensions after retirement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88f49fa98e4359ef4d0b915d275558983252afd/0_88_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d994802d9aa7ed7c6fc987348deeeac","title":"new zealand marine heatwave tropical","story":"Rare tropical fish from Australia have been spotted in New Zealand waters after a record-breaking hot summer and warm ocean temperatures lured the creatures across the Tasman sea.The Queensland groper, also known as the giant grouper, is the aquatic emblem of the state and was spotted swimming around the wreck of the HMNZ Canterbury in the Bay of Islands on Sunday, more than 3,000 kilometres away from its usual cruising spots on the coral reefs and estuaries off the Queensland coast.New Zealand experienced its hottest summer on record this year, largely propelled by a “marine heatwave” during which sea temperatures rose as much as six degrees in some areas, and 2-4 in the region where the groper was spotted.Figures released by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research found the average temperature during January was 20.3C – more than three degrees above normal.The Queensland groper, a bony fish that can grow up to three metres long and weigh 600kg, is a protected species in Australia, was spotted and recorded by a skipper from Paihia Dive, a small coastal town in the far north of the country.The fish are known for their curious natures, and often approach ers. Craig Johnston, owner of Paihia Dive, said it was “very rare” to see them, and the odds of their survival were slim once sea temperatures dipped below 18 degrees. “This is unusual, I’ve been working in the industry 20 years and there hasn’t been a season like this before, it’s quite incredible,”Johnston said Australian marine life end up in New Zealand when they “hop on” the East Auckland current, which begins life as the East Australian current and runs along the coast before making its way to New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.The water in New Zealand was generally too cold for the fish to breed, and they would usually die by winter.Sightings of marine life not usually present in New Zealand waters have been noted around the country this year, including kingfish in Dunedin Harbour, garden eels in the Kermadec Islands (1,000km north of New Zealand), sergeant major damselfish, striated frog fish and Lord Howe Moray in Northland and lion’s mane jellyfish in Wellington Harbour.The heatwave also led to a boom in land-based animals, including an explosion in the rodent population, which was predicted to increase 10-fold by the spring, due to an abundance in food supply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d363e5c66c4a1b8ebb06ddef607b4fa187a23f39/0_155_4670_2802/master/4670.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fee19ba16f68df63a19d4042d56a8203","title":"pregnant breastfeeding models key bumper sales","story":"From Chanel to Victoria’s Secret, visible bumps and breastfeeding are increasingly being used to sell clothes. It says a lot about fashion’s changing relationship with womenFashion loves to break its own rules, then unbreak them, then pretend the rules didn’t exist, then act as though everyone knew the rules all along, and since from the outside there is only one rule – be thin – this leads to some quite complex conversations. One year, you will find a plus-size model on every catwalk, and the next year they will have vanished.But the final frontier is the pregnant woman, or – pretty much interchangeably, because you always look pregnant for ages after you are, unless you’re Madonna – the breastfeeding woman. There was that brief moment in 1991, when Annie Leibovitz put a gravid Demi Moore on the cover of Vanity Fair wearing nothing at all (commentators describe her pose as the “hand-bra”). Nothing came after. The pregnant woman remained culturally invisible, which really is a curious sensation when you’re in it, given how ginormous you are.New York fashion week broke that article of faith last year, when the Eckhaus Latta show featured Maia Ruth Lee, who was eight months pregnant at the time, wearing a cardigan dress with a perfectly domed opening for her mighty tum, like something a midwife might design if he or she were in such a rush they wanted to measure everyone’s fundus by eye. But that reminded everyone: there actually had been some pregnant catwalk models, this decade. You could fit them all into two taxis, like the Lib Dems, but nine is more than none.There was Jourdan Dunn for Jean Paul Gaultier’s springsummer 2010 show and Italian model Bianca Balti for Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana’s autumnwinter 2015 collection.New Zealand model Ashleigh Good was the final showstopper in the Chanel show for autumnwinter 1415, looking so pure and punk, so breathtakingly wonderful, that close observers may have felt that chill of the truly unattainable standards of fashion: to meet its trend criteria, you might have to get pregnant.Victoria’s Secret has been at the vanguard, accounting for three of those nine. But its catwalk always has an uncomfortable relationship with the fashion mainstream, being too raunchy and saucy and seeming to miss the point (it’s art, not clothes-porn), but every now and then sailing past the point to make a new and possibly better one.Jenni Kayne, an LA brand you might put into the category athleisure, saw sales triple after an image of TyLynn Nguyen breastfeeding\u0026nbspwent up on billboards in New York this month, defying marketing truisms (who last bought something\u0026nbspthey saw on a billboard? Nancy Reagan?) but also deeper assumptions about where our ego sits in relation to images of female beauty. If we were simply spectators to the more urgent male gaze, a breastfeeding woman would be like a regular woman, only not as good. But if we’re projecting ourselves, our hopes and memories, on to the image, then\u0026nbspit makes perfect sense for this to spike sales, since breastfeeding is a much more profound romantic experience than, say, having a shower.It would be fanciful to claim that pregnant models do much to spread the idea that pregnancy is, in itself, beautiful. But I still find the development quite heartening, for putting the female audience at the centre of an art form. For a bloody change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9755c69dba3d86c74e41e37003d990f501816c8/0_123_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a06bd2930b6ccf457a133fd856e39027","title":"eni aluko chelsea abroad world cup pundit interview","story":"Forward reflects on a ‘stressful, negative period’ as she gets set to play abroad after leaving Chelsea while looking forward to some World Cup punditryEni Aluko is wearing a lime-green Hawaiian print shirt and is surprisingly sprightly after a week of celebrations to mark the end of her time as a Chelsea player. There was a champagne party bus home from the game in Bristol where the club won the title unbeaten, plus festivities that followed her scoring in her final match at Liverpool. Back in London, Aluko cooked paella for 20 friends at her home and David Luiz invited the squad to dine at his new Italian restaurant.“It had been an amazing week with women who have become good friends,” Aluko says. “Finishing this season in such a positive way wrapped up what started so negatively for me personally.”Between the revelry, there were plenty of tears as the 31-year-old considered reversing her decision. Aluko had grown frustrated at her bit-part role, concluding after five and a half years with Chelsea she would be more fulfilled elsewhere. She has signed with a club in Europe but won’t reveal where.“I’ve achieved pretty much everything I wanted to with Chelsea except maybe the Champions League, which I could still do somewhere else. I love to travel and sample new cultures the opportunity to play in Europe and learn a language is a big one. But there have been a lot of tears. I was crying on the pitch in Bristol. I have such a strong bond with the people I work with and questioned whether I’m ever going to experience that again with a new team, whether I’ll be that happy – the doubts start creeping in.”A forward with electrifying pace, Aluko has been one of the outstanding players in Britain for more than 15 years, since joining Birmingham City Ladies aged 15. Marcus Bignot, her coach at the time, called her the “Wayne Rooney of women’s football”.Her mum, Sileola, and dad, Daniel, a former MP in Nigeria, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. She excelled at school and her parents encouraged her to continue her education even as it became apparent a top-flight football career was a possibility for her and her younger brother, Sone.Alongside playing she graduated with a first-class honours degree from Brunel University and worked as a lawyer. Aluko is adamant girls should not be forced to choose between a football career and academic studies, calling for clubs to offer the same opportunities as they do to their male counterparts.“My issue is young, talented players not having to compromise their education. If you look at the men’s academy setups, they have partnerships with colleges or universities, whereas we don’t really have that with women’s football. You don’t want an 18-year-old girl who’s very talented thinking: ‘I want to play for the first team but I’ve got to give up my education to do so.’ That has happened a lot in the past.“Some of big men’s clubs like Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal have raised the bar in terms of salaries and professionalism of the women’s game. I think there needs to be continued increase in salaries to reflect the attention on the game and its commercial viability. The argument before was that nobody was watching but that’s not true nowadays.”The idea that 45,000 fans would attend a women’s FA Cup final, as they did this month at Wembley, was scarcely believable when Aluko was cutting her teeth in the Midlands. She has noticed more girls coming up to her in the street or at games but what she finds most heartening is the sight of more young boys at Women’s Super League matches.“That’s the biggest change: young boys watching like they’re watching a men’s game, coming up and asking for my boots just as they would with Eden Hazard. That’s not only going to affect their perception of football it’s going to affect their perception of women, so when they grow up to have relationships they’re more likely to respect women as equals. They are seeing women in a very positive light and in a strong, competitive environment. Women’s sport has become normalised.”Aluko did not set out to become a champion of equality or a spokesperson on problems around discrimination. But she found herself on the front page and in parliament after accusing the former England women’s coach Mark Sampson of making racial comments to her and another player. She also alleged the Football Association had failed to investigate properly, as revealed by the\u0026nbsp.Privately Aluko was shunned by some of her former team-mates and was publicly accused of being a liar. An investigation by the barrister Katharine Newton ruled she had told the truth. Sampson later lost his job for an unrelated matter. But after a distinguished 11-year international career during which she won 102 caps, Aluko has been on the England sidelines for two years. Phil Neville has left the door open but she does not know if she will go back.“I spoke to him at a Chelsea game this season and it was a nice conversation. I congratulated him on his appointment and we talked about him moving back from Spain and I’m sure he’s seen a few games where I’ve played this season.“But I’ve moved on from what was a very stressful, negative period in my life. I’ve dealt with it in the best way I could. Standing up for what you believe in and being honest, telling the truth are all very liberating things. Since that time I’ve felt very empowered by other people seeing you can stand for what you believe, even in adversity. Success is always the best answer to critics. When you look at some of the greatest people and players in the world they all stand for something outside their working lives.”Aluko will be in Russia working as a pundit on ITV’s World Cup coverage. In 2014 she made history as the first female pundit on Match of the Day and believes she has opened the door for other women players to make a move into broadcasting, although she concedes there is still a way to travel for equality.“I think it gets massively forgotten with women commentators and pundits that we grew up watching men’s football. I remember the FA Cup final – Man United v Everton – in 1995 and we lost 1-0 and me and my brother were all dressed in the full kit and we were crying our eyes out. My mum came in the room and was like: ‘What is wrong with my children, why are they so devastated about a football match?’ That was my upbringing.“To be going to Russia to work on a men’s World Cup is incredible. I never thought that would happen and it shows a shift in broadcasting where women are becoming accepted just as part of the team. I think the difference is that if women fail, the consequences are greater.“There’s a tendency for some male pundits who have done it for years to rock up and take it for granted. I can’t afford to do that so that’s why I have to geek out on all the stats and facts and make sure I am not seen as a token woman but that I’m adding to the conversation.”As with all areas of her life and playing career, Aluko will ensure she is well prepared for any eventuality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3c3c8b25490613ca390712f089224d9e97ff7d5/0_59_2335_1401/master/2335.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007c6098511d91d5c99c982d81cca7c8","title":"liverpool fabinho monaco close signing","story":"• Brazil midfielder set to replace Emre Can at Anfield• Mo Salah to travel to Spain for treatment on shoulderLiverpool have confirmed the signing of the Brazil midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for £40m as a replacement for Emre Can as Jürgen Klopp steps up his summer recruitment drive.Negotiations with the Ligue\u0026nbsp1 side over a €45m (£40m) fee plus a potential €5m in add-ons have been ongoing for several days, with a statement from Liverpool on Monday night confirming the 24-year-old will move to Anfield on 1\u0026nbspJuly after he completed a medical at the club’s training ground.“I am really excited about this move,” Fabinho told Liverpool’s website. “This is something that I always wanted – this is a giant of a team. The infrastructures of the club look exceptional. A football club of this size coming after my services: I didn’t have to think that much about coming over. I will try to create my own history at this football club. Hopefully, on a personal level, I’m able to win titles with this club.”Manchester United had also been credited with an interest in the player, whose agent is Jorge Mendes, but are now expected to sign Fabinho’s international team-mate Fred from Shakhtar Donetsk instead.The Germany international Can is expected to leave Anfield for Juventus after rejecting the offer of a new contract, with reports in Italy that he was due to complete a medical this week.The signing of Fabinho, therefore, represents something of a coup for Liverpool, who have already secured the arrival of the Guinea midfielder Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig this summer and have held talks to sign France forward Nabil Fekir from Lyon.

The buttery crumb of the pastry that gives way under your fork, the soft quiver of the filling within, the crumbs you can dab into your mouth with a finger. I make tarts far less than I should considering how much I like them.These two may not be quick, but they are relatively easy: one uses buff leaves of shop-bought filo the other an easy olive-oil pastry that doesn’t need to rest. Both are filled with the spoils of spring. Tempted?A perfect tart to weave together the days of spring and summer. Spears of asparagus, buttery leeks, dijon and an unexpected hit of rosemary. This quick olive-oil pastry is easy enough for a weeknight. I use cherry tomatoes until the season is in full swing. You’ll need a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin.For the pastry200g wholemeal or light spelt flour1 sprig rosemary, leaves picked and finely choppedZest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated 1 pinch salt50ml olive oilCold waterFor the filling400g cherry tomatoes, halvedSalt and black pepperExtra-virgin olive oil1 leek, finely sliced2 sprigs rosemary, leaves picked and finely chopped450g asparagus3 eggs3 tbsp creme fraicheZest of 1 unwaxed lemon, finely grated1 tsp dijon mustardHeat the oven to 120C250Fgas ¼. Lay the tomatoes cut side up on a baking tray, season, drizzle with olive oil, then slowly roast for about an hour, until soft, sweet and gummy. Take a handful out for the dressing, and set aside. Once the tomatoes are roasted, take them out of the oven and turn the heat up temperature to 180C350Fgas 4.Next make the pastry. Put the flour, rosemary, lemon zest and salt into a food processor. Pulse a few times, then add the olive oil and pulse again until you have crumbs. Add about 75ml of cold water until it comes together in a ball. (If you don’t have a food processor you can do this just as easily by hand.)On a floured work surface, roll it out to just bigger than the tart tin, then carefully wrap it around your rolling pin and lower it into the tin. Gently press it in, so the pastry takes the shape of the tin. Prick with a fork and blind bake for 12 minutes (no need to use baking beans for with this pastry).Saute the leek in a little oil for 20 minutes until soft and sweet, add the rosemary and cook for a minute. Put a large pan of salted water on to boil. Snap the asparagus spears spears near the base – they will naturally break off where the fibrous part ends. Boil the asparagus for two to three minutes, until the spears are still firm but not crunchy. Drain, season at once and drizzle with oil.Mix the eggs with the creme fraiche, sauteed leeks, zest and dijon, then season. Once the pastry is ready, scatter with the asparagus, then pour over the creme fraiche mixture and scatter with the tomatoes.Bake the tart on the bottom of the oven at 200C390Fgas 6 for 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and the eggs just set. Serve with a sharply dressed green salad.This tart is incidentally vegan, provided you use vegan filo, which happens to be the most common.500g fresh or frozen peasOlive oil1 bunch spring onions, slicedSalt and black pepper1 x 400g tin white beans, drained1 preserved lemon, flesh removed, rind finely chopped1 handful green olives, stoned and roughly chopped1 good pinch chilli flakes1 small bunch mint, picked and roughly chopped1 small bunch parsley, picked and roughly chopped1 × 200g pack filo pastryHeat the oven to 220C425Fgas 7.

Tip into a bowl and add the rest of the peas, the preserved lemon, olives, chilli, mint and parsley, then season well and mix.Unwrap the sheets of filo and lay them over your frying pan, leaving a little overlap round the edges (you’ll fold this in later). Drizzle with oil, then keep layering the filo and drizzling with oil until you have a good, sturdy, three- to four-sheet layer all over – you may need to patch it together bit by bit if you have small sheets.Drizzle the whole lot with a bit more olive oil, then use a pastry brush to persuade the oil all over the pastry. Spoon the filling into the middle, spread it evenly across the base, put the pan over a medium heat and cook for three to four minutes to crisp up the pastry from the bottom.Fold the excess filo back over the filling to form a wavy edge. Put on the bottom of the oven and bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden and crisp.

At least, this is the lie I tell myself, how I am able to face my reflection in the mirror every day without collapsing into a puddle of regret.After spending a year at a dance conservatory in London, I quit. A year later, I tried again at a university in my home state of Virginia. But two years in, I broke my foot and decided to switch to a major that was less tied to my physical integrity: journalism. Soon, I became the arts editor of the school paper. Now, 10 years after graduating from college, I have three beautiful sons and a successful freelance writing career. But the fact that I quit before I had the chance to see if I could truly succeed haunts me to this day.I struggle to articulate this level of experience when explaining my background to people. I “trained to be a professional dancer” I was a “semi-professional dancer” I “studied dance in college and used to teach ballet classes”. When you bring up past dance experience, most people assume it was merely a little girl’s daydream, but for me, it was so much more. What do you call it when you dedicate all of your time and energy to preparing for something but don’t ever become that something? What’s the name for not being strong enough to risk failure so you quit while you’re ahead and live the rest of your life comforting yourself with the notion that you might have “made it” if only you’d really tried? Isn’t that it’s own special, uniquely devastating form of failure?Our culture fetishizes determination, grit, success. We are told again and again that hard work will eventually pay off, that quitting is practically unforgivable. What we don’t hear is that success isn’t necessarily synonymous with happiness and that giving up can be an act of self-preservation.It is spring in New York City and I am 16. My dance teacher has driven me and one other student up so we could take a few master classes at various schools and studios around town and so that I could audition for a place at the Joffrey Ballet School. It is my first visit to New York and I am immediately intoxicated by the dangerous combination of the city’s energy and a newfound sense of freedom. I taste my first Indian food, buy chunky pleather platform loafers, do ballet poses for photos next to the rocks in Central Park.This Joffrey studio is much smaller and much dimmer than I imagined it’s not much more than a couple of grocery-store aisles wide. As a young dancer in a tiny college town, I had envisioned a vast, sun-filled affair, but I underestimated how strapped for space cities are. The worst part of any audition is always before it starts. That’s when you can psych yourself out. I pull at my itchy pink tights and readjust the leg holes of my black leotard. While warming up, I try to avoid my reflection in the mirror, but also keep an eye out for the coveted “skinny mirror” that each studio possesses. It helps that none of the other girls here are auditioning they are students and I am just a guest in the class.Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I am nervous but unintimidated. I know how to do this. I’ve got this. I’m in my element. The class goes well. Really well. I remember all of the combinations, remember to smile. I am energetic and quick on my feet. Most importantly, I can keep up with the other students. After class, I excitedly head to the changing room, surprised by how well I did and hopeful of my chances at being accepted into the school. I think about how, if admitted, I would leave home and live in a dorm at the Carmelite nuns’ convent.“She’s good, but she’s big,” I overhear the instructor say to my dance teacher as I am coming back down the hallway.I stop in my tracks, trying to process this comment without crying or letting on that I heard. But in that moment, my spirit is crushed. So many thoughts swirl through my head on the rest of our trip. I can’t believe that the wrongness of my body’s shape carries more weight than my ability to move it precisely and artfully through space. I can’t believe that a skinnier, potentially less-talented dancer would get “my” spot at the school. But most of all, I can’t believe how embarrassing and utterly humiliating it feels to be turned down not because I’m not good enough, but because I’m not skinny enough.These thoughts eventually crystallize into confusion, questions. Why had I been blessed with these talents in this body? What does it mean when your body is your art? Can a thicker brush not make just as beautiful strokes?I come late to dance. Later than most anyway. I am 11 years old when I take my first class – it’s a free class being offered on the stage of the little community theater in my small college town – but my natural aptitude quickly became apparent. As a naturally quiet, introverted person, dance is a revelation. I don’t have to speak a word to anyone. I discover a world beyond words, where movements tell stories in ways that words only ever dream of doing. It’s a world where words themselves become superfluous and seem almost perversely simplistic, and I am overjoyed to inhabit it every day.Soon, I am training for two to four hours a day. Homeschooling means I can be driven to studios an hour from my home to take classes multiple times a week with more advanced teachers. Finally, I am living with other families or my dance teacher during the week so I can train at the best school in the region. Summers are spent at ballet “intensives”, which means six weeks away from home, living in dorms, taking classes all day at the Washington Ballet and the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. I am getting better and better. I revel in my ability to balance en pointe forever and turn with ease. I once did five rotations in a single pirouette turn. Five. The typical maximum for women is three. It’s a moment I will never forget.But when you hear the word “ballerina”, my body is not what your mind’s eye conjures.When puberty hits at 15, weight begins to stick to me. I begin to sport fleshy hips, meaty thighs, a blossoming bosom. I’m not fat amongst “regular” people – I wear a women’s size 8 – but I am fat for a ballerina. In this profession, rarely is anyone bigger than a size 4. Ballerinas are supposed to be beyond human: to evoke ethereal, otherworldly beings that toe the line between the sensual and the virginal. To have noticeable breasts and hips is to interrupt this fantasy with grotesque sexuality, to remind the audience that you are indeed human.After that audition, I begin to doubt my abilities, question my chances of one day becoming a professional dancer. From then on, I never see exactly what I want in the mirror. Mirrors are unavoidable for most dancers, covering the walls of nearly every studio. I spend hours in front of them every day. I like the lines I see reflected, the shapes I can contort into, how I can mimic the movements of my teachers with relative ease. What the mirror also shows me now are my birthing hips and heavy boobs, the wiggly bits of flesh hanging from my upper arms. Now when I see all my fellow dancers reflected in the mirror around me, I see not how harmonious our movements are, but how their slight frames magnify the generousness of my own.“Are you sure you’re a ballet dancer,” the orthopedic surgeon asked at a consultation for persistent pain in the joint of my right big toe. “Because you look more like a modern dancer.” I am 17 years old. And after visiting a dozen doctors in my small hometown – enduring painful cortisone shots that provided no relief – we drove two hours to see this doctor because he is the company doctor for a big regional ballet troupe. His comment leaves me embarrassed, scrambling for an answer. I’m pretty sure the doctor believes my pain is the result of the “excess” weight I am putting on my feet, but sure enough, his scans uncover a tendon fraying and rubbing in between the bones of my joint.I did try modern dance later, when I was in college. While it is a more freeing form of dance – less rigid, significantly more forgiving of differing body types – I honestly wasn’t very good at it. At school in London, I was placed in the highest level of ballet and the lowest level of modern.The summer after that crushing Joffrey audition, I am sent to stay at my grandparents’ horse farm an hour outside of New Orleans without the rest of my immediate family. It’s partly meant to be a punishment for being caught kissing a boy while just shy of the pre-appointed old-enough age of 16. But no parental punishment was worse than what I could inflict upon myself. Not for kissing boys, mind you – that was fun – but for being fat.To drown out the hum of the treadmill, I turn up the local alternative rock radio station on my cassette Walkman. The song is White Town’s I Could Never Be Your Woman. It features heavily in the rotation this summer. I haven’t lived enough to appreciate what the lyrics are implying, but the song’s eerie, repeated refrain haunts me. I keep running. The air conditioning struggles to counteract the stifling humidity. Some people say the air is “close” but it feels more like nature is trying to slowly suffocate you by gradually replacing the air with water. Best grow gills or flounder and die. I run for an hour every day, pushing the incline button higher and higher, pushing the speed button again and again. Through the sweat and the muscle aches. I stop only when I get so dizzy I worry I might pass out and fall. I run away from my fat, away from the possibility of failure. I run and I run but I never get where I want to go. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. My grandmother presents lovingly prepared, home-cooked southern food – fried eggs and meat-and-potato hash, beautiful pies – but I eat only one meal a day and refuse the rest. I love hash it’s something we never eat at home. It’s a salty, fluffy, greasy southern indulgence like no other. I’ve never refused her cooking before, but if my grandmother senses something is amiss, she doesn’t mention it. Outside of my mother’s watchful eye, I try my hand at bulimia. I quickly discover that trying to induce my own vomiting is much too traumatic and difficult. So instead, I down excessive amounts of milk of magnesia laxative. Nothing I try leads to much in the way of weight loss, mostly because I am simply messing with my metabolism. When I start eating a healthy amount of food and stop abusing laxatives, I put the weight right back on.The sweetest revenge, the best way to prove all of the doubters and haters wrong, would’ve been to go on to be wildly successful. Our culture is very clear that overcoming your shortcomings to emerge victorious is the only acceptable ending to such stories. But years of hearing how incorrect my body was took its toll. It’s hard to love an art form that everyone is telling you doesn’t love you back. It becomes too difficult to reconcile your physical talent with your physical inadequacy. I’ve largely stopped bringing up my dance background to new acquaintances. Not because it’s so far in the past or even because I don’t know how to define my experience, but because I know that when I say I was a ballet dancer, I am certain that person immediately assesses my body and wonders what kind of fantasyland I once lived in. “Ballet” has become my trigger word. Talking about it releases the hounds of self-loathing and crushing regret, who nip determinedly at my ankles.I left the world of dance for the world of words because the writing world doesn’t care if I break my foot. I figured if I couldn’t dance, at least I could write about it. I reasoned that since my body isn’t central to the art of journalism, the writing world shouldn’t care if I am 150 pounds or 250 pounds. I know now that there are no industries, virtually no spaces where women’s bodies aren’t judged. Yet writing, while still a creative pursuit, does not feed my soul in the same way that dance – the world beyond words – does.I haven’t seen the inside of a dance studio in about eight years. Every day that I don’t dance, a sliver of my soul withers. My heart aches to move again, to get lost in myself, to get lost in music, in motion, in space to trace those familiar patterns and shapes that still come so easily to me as I twirl safe in my kitchen. I want so much more. I want to be in a real studio with my peers on a real stage. I want to know what it would have been like if I’d kept going, kept pushing back at the haters.I can’t help but feel jealous of the adults I see talking about taking up ballet or re-entering the studio again for the first time since they were young. I envy that pure, uncomplicated joy that dance can bring it’s something I fear I’ll never feel again. I can’t just waltz into a dance studio and take a class. If merely mentioning dance to someone spurs a rush of inadequacy and failure, who knows what actually taking a class might unearth within me. Besides, I am not like them. I am not one of those people who merely took a few ballet classes in middle school. I could have been a professional. I got too close, so it hurts too much. It’s been a long road, but my body and I have come to a detente. I’m now a happy size 12: satisfied by the knowledge that my body – whether in spite of or because of its size – has executed perfect pirouettes and birthed beautiful babies. But coming to terms with my body doesn’t mean I necessarily forgive it for betraying me that I’ll ever stop wondering whether I might have spent my life onstage had I only been a bit lighter.Olivia Campbell is a journalist and essayist specializing in medicine, mothering, arts, and history.

Growing up in Portsmouth, I felt it was the far superior seaside town. Even though it’s just an hour away on the fast train, for me, in 2003, it felt like a different world. In Portsmouth, I felt trapped. I knew lots of people and I’m from a big family, so I always felt like I was being watched: I wasn’t. I would get on the train at Fratton, she would jump on at Chichester and 60 minutes later I would be looking out on Brighton beach.Brighton was the perfect place for a little gay to have a go at being “out” for an hour or so before going back home and pretending to have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio (when, in truth, I just wanted to kiss Kate Winslet).She was fit, cool and had a really good MP3 player. I guess it was my first flutter of feelings for someone. I don’t think we were a couple, we never had that chat, we just both knew we were a bit different from everyone else, and in Brighton that summer we felt normal. I remember seeing older girls on the seafront pretty, cool and happily queer. I would stare at them, besotted, and wonder what their lives were like, if their families knew or if they had been kicked out of home. Were they ashamed like me? They seemed happy and they were having a laugh. It gave me hope that coming out wouldn’t ruin my life. That summer, I felt alive, I felt free. We shared roll-up cigarettes and the occasional kiss under the pier, talking about who we were going to become, where we were going to live and the adventures we would share.The six-week summer break came to an end and so did our brief romance. She decided to come out when we went back to college: she was telling everyone, even her mum. I thought she had completely lost her mind (it took at least another five years to get me out of the closet). We had a huge row on Brighton pier just in front of the waltzers a few people stopped to watch, which felt both exciting and embarrassing. She called me a dyke, I called her a bitch and we barely spoke again.It wasn’t exactly the perfect ending to my summer of love. After the row, she stormed off and I jumped on my skateboard and flew down the seafront with tears in my eyes and sea salt in my hair. I felt like I was in music video, which was thrilling, until I clipped a stone, came tumbling off and ripped my favourite pair of Dickies jeans. I vowed I would never love again, in that way that only a 17-year-old can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b40ede5aa7719eea2abcf591d177d7b502c0a834/0_0_7082_4721/master/7082.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=139ed7160f80e0b79ee88ce12431ef0e 1440w","title":"mays 2bn housing pledge not enough say tory council leaders","story":"Poll finds overwhelming majority want low-cost rented homes to form part of solutionTheresa May is facing pressure from Conservative council leaders to invest more in low-cost rented homes, amid growing concern at local authority level that not enough is being done to fix Britain’s housing crisis.Another report has found that parents are likely to be lending less money to help their children on to the property ladder this year, owing to constrained household budgets since the EU referendum.The so-called bank of mum and dad now has less money available to support property purchases than in recent years, according to the study by the Centre for Economics and Business Research commissioned by the insurance company Legal \u0026amp General.The amount of financial support is expected to fall from £6.5bn last year to £5.7bn in 2018, although parents are still expected to help finance as many as one in four property sales. The predicted fall is the first since the research began in 2016. According to the study, the average contribution from parents towards housing is expected to decline from £21,600 in 2017 to £18,000 this year.While showing the mounting pressure on household finances, the figures still highlight the growing importance of inherited wealth in modern Britain. There are fears that home ownership will increasingly be reserved for the children of the rich, adding to mounting levels of inequality.After years of growth since the 1980s, home ownership has been falling in recent years, to the grave concern of Conservatives, who have traditionally been able to rely on the votes of owner-occupiers. Amid a lack of new housebuilding and rising prices over the past decade, young people aged 25-34 are now less likely to own a home than were people of that age in the early 1960s.Independent analysis suggests current construction of affordable housing falls short of the requirements by about 30,000 homes per year. Joseph Rowntree said it was calling on the government to deliver at least 80,000 low-cost rented homes a year in order to make the housing market work for more people.Campbell Robb, the charity’s chief executive, said: “Homelessness and poverty should have no place in our society. However, right now millions of people are locked out of being able to achieve a decent standard of living due to crippling rents.”The publication of a green paper on social housing is expected within the coming months. Ministers have used policies such as the help-to-buy scheme to support first-time buyers, although experts say a better solution would be to build more affordable homes across the country. The Tories have promised to deliver an average of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s, up from 217,000 in 2016.Urging the government to lift a cap on the amount of money councils can borrow to fund housebuilding, he said: “Doing so would spark a renaissance in housebuilding, allowing us in local government to do our bit to help address the housing crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1cc82ba60aa0d06fa0757f25bbc75e0d7dd62d/0_81_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4407d3f3c98a3cc5ff44d60edf8081ac","title":"icc intends to interview players alleged involvement spot fixing al jazeera","story":"The unnamed England and Australia cricketers alleged to have been involved in spot-fixing by al-Jazeera’s undercover investigation into corruption are set to be interviewed when the International Cricket Council’s own probe gets under way.ICC officials are due to meet with the Qatar-based broadcaster this week following a request for all unedited materials sourced during the making of Cricket’s Match Fixers, the documentary that was aired on Sunday, to be shared with them.Among the claims aired was the allegation that three England players batted to order during the fifth Test against India in Chennai, December 2016, having agreed to score below a set number of runs during a 10-over passage of play as part of a betting scam.The England and Wales Cricket Board has issued a strong denial of any wrongdoing by its players, stating there is “no credible evidence”, as did Cricket Australia following a similar allegation made about two of their batsmen when they played the third Test against India in Ranchi last year.While all five players’ names were redacted in the final edit, along with specific match details that would assist in identifying them, the ICC will seek to get this information from the upcoming meeting with al-Jazeera and then look to speak to those allegedly involved.Speaking before his side’s departure for a limited‑overs tour of England in June, the Australia captain, Tim Paine, said: “At this stage it’s unsubstantiated claims. We’re confident that none of our guys are involved in it. As far as I’m concerned our players have got nothing to worry about. I’m really confident none of our players are involved.”The allegation of English involvement comes at an already troubling time for the Test team given the disappointing nine-wicket defeat to Pakistan at Lord’s on Sunday that has seen them now go eight matches without a win.Trevor Bayliss, the England head coach, has however insisted the allegations were not responsible for their poor showing. He said: “There was no chat about it in the change-room. It would be wrong to blame that for the way we played. When we were told about it, the thought on it was that it was rubbish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa88bff9bf7b3959431affa9c630163efa68f066/9_1_4914_2948/master/4914.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3f58b39a57c287d563342d0a9445fb5","title":"unanswered questions leave chris froome in the shadow of suspicion","story":"While Simon Yates comes out of the Giro d’Italia with credit, there is still uncertainty about Team Sky and their lead rider When Simon Yates cracked so disastrously on the bottom slopes of the Colle delle Finestre while leading the Giro d’Italia last Friday, it looked like the most humiliating of personal catastrophes. Yet it may have been the best thing that has ever happened to the young English rider, at least if he wants to avoid the fate of Chris Froome, the man who caused his downfall. Yates had gone into his 13th day in the leader’s pink jersey holding an advantage of almost half a minute over his nearest pursuer, with the memory of a trio of majestic victories on mountain stages to keep his morale high as he faced the challenge of hanging on for just three more days. He couldn’t do it. As Team Sky marshalled their forces to send a revived Froome spinning up the unmade road leading to the 2,178m summit, Yates had no answer. When Froome slipped away from the leading bunch up the right-hand side of the road, with 80km of the stage and two more major climbs still to go, the young Englishman was looking to his left. When he spotted the danger he found there was nothing left in the legs that had carried him clear of his rivals on those earlier mountains. By the end of stage 19 he had lost the huge amount of 38 minutes and all hope of finishing high in the general classification, never mind of challenging Froome for the victory.  A day later, on the stage from Susa to Cervina, he lost a further 45 minutes and on Sunday in Rome he wound up 21st in the final overall classification, an hour and a quarter behind Froome. But in one respect – perhaps, in the end, the most important of all – his downfall represented an unexpected success. By hitting the wall two days in a row, Yates provided convincing evidence that he is riding clean. Any doper cracking as comprehensively as he did would make sure the same thing did not happen the next day. That’s what Floyd Landis did in the 2006 Tour de France, when he responded to failure on the Galibier and the Croix de Fer by dosing himself with testosterone and returning to take a stage to the ski station at Morzine with an epic solo escape of 120kms. That positioned him to take the yellow jersey in Paris, which he did – until the traces of testosterone showed up and he was stripped of his victory.  Yates’s failure surely banished the doubts cast by the four-month ban handed down in 2016 after his team had failed to complete a TUE form for a controlled asthma medication. Even though the official designation of the offence was “non-intentional doping”, Yates was the first to admit that the shadow would linger, possibly for the remainder of his career. Now, perhaps, it has been removed. Froome would love to be able to say the same, but he chose to race in Italy while last year’s adverse analytical finding for Salbutamol is still under investigation. That is his right, and he claims that the findings will clear him to everyone’s satisfaction. But he cannot blame those who have listened to so many lies from cyclists that they are inclined to make scepticism their first response. For them, the instinctive desire to cheer was stifled long before he had crossed the finish line. His great escape on the Finestre should have been worthy of a place in road cycling’s most romantic feats. The names of Coppi, Merckx and other heroes of various golden ages were widely invoked, but I was reminded, as Froome made his way through the banks of snow at the summit, of the Luxembourg champion Charly Gaul’s astonishing ride through the Dolomites from Merano to Monte Bondone on stage 20 of the 1956 Giro. The Angel of the Mountains, as he was nicknamed, started the day in 24th place overall and launched his attack in unspeakably filthy weather, gradually shedding all his rivals. Many of them abandoned the race altogether on the final climb, during which Gaul’s frozen limbs had to be revived during a brief stop with warm water and a swift massage from his team manager before he remounted to finish the 240km stage more than eight minutes ahead of his nearest pursuer. Two days later, just like Froome, he was in the pink jersey on the final podium.Such are the legends on which cycling history is built (and, yes, we accept that the heroes of the golden ages used primitive doping products to dull the pain). Froome, elbows out and legs whirring as he raced up the shale track before plunging down a descent made treacherous by rivulets of meltwater, was bidding to join them, and to some he did. For once, even his inelegant style, normally an affront to those who prize elegance on a bike, made perfect sense: he grew up riding mountain bikes on trails in Kenya, and here he was putting those techniques to good use. Others, however, look at Team Sky’s tainted record over the past couple of years, involving inconsistent accounts of potentially damaging incidents and medical records that went missing or were never kept. They wonder why, when Froome was asked point-blank during the Giro’s first rest day whether he was still using Salbutamol, he refused to give an answer. Perhaps he did so in the belief that he retains the right to the statutory confidentiality which was ripped apart when the adverse finding was made public by this newspaper. But cycling, and serial grand tour winners in particular, long ago forfeited the right to keep secrets. While it continues to do so, some of us who long to applaud will be keeping our hands in our pockets.

It looks a bit like the start of The Apprentice but it’s King Lear. “Nothing will come of nothing” … you’re fired.Just along the river, Gloucester and Kent (Jims Broadbent and Carter) arrive at the Tower in a black Range Rover. The king presumably will land at City airport in a Learjet. He doesn’t. They missed a trick there.Anyway, he’s already here at the Tower. In Richard Eyre’s TV adaptation, Lear (Anthony Hopkins) is a military dictator in the present, gathering the troops – and the family – for the ision of the kingdom.The north, and its powerhouse presumably, goes to Goneril (Emma Thompson). The West Country to Regan (Emily Watson, this is a seriously sparkly cast). The prosperous south-east is due to be Cordelia’s, until she fails in her filial flattery and is disinherited, disowned and sent to France (boo) instead.It’s really not such a leap of the imagination – the ageing, dangerous, male autocrat losing the plot. Or the power-passing down a generation. I thought of the Kims over in Pyongyang, another dynasty that also has favourite offspring, illegitimate offspring, a Midsomer body count and sibling poisoning. And the Murdochs.Anyway, the point is, Eyre’s TV Lear doesn’t just sparkle and shine with city lights and thespy stars, it hammers on the big bell of relevance as well. (The Bard should probably take some of the credit, too.)Shakespeare on television – a box it wasn’t designed for and doesn’t necessarily fit – isn’t always successful. It only works if it’s not just a play on the telly, but something in its own right, too, with its own identity. This one achieves that, with pace and modernity.No Learjets maybe, but there are helicopters, and other 21st-century weaponry, in the war between England and France. Kent’s disguise is a skinhead cut. Edmund and Edgar’s duel, an epic bout, is fought in the medium of … mixed martial arts. The heath has a busy A-road passing through it, along which to wander along – the A2 perhaps, on its way to Dover.It also encompasses a dreary city centre, the no-longer-new-town of Stevenage. That’s a memorable scene: Gloucester, now sightless, and Edgar, sitting on a bench in a concrete precinct, bumped into by Lear, in the full throes of madness, pushing his overflowing supermarket trolley around. That’s exactly where they’d be today, Stevenage. It’s not surprising to hear that a passerby mistook Hopkins for a homeless person and directed him to a hostel.I’m not Michael Billington (just to be clear): I cannot compare Hopkins’s performance with other great Lears I have known, to be honest I haven’t known that many. I can say it is that, though – a great one. Now 80 himself, the right age, Hopkins is at home in Lear’s skin. Shouty, angry, cruel one moment vulnerable, tender, loving the next – or at the same time. A mesmerising performance.Thompson’s power-hungry and cold Goneril reminded me of another Hopkins – Katie, who was in The Apprentice. There are fabulous performances all over the place I enjoyed Karl Johnson’s Fool and Christopher Eccleston’s oily Oswald. Plus, TV provides an intimacy you don’t get at the National Theatre. A bit too intimate, perhaps, in Gloucester’s eye-gouging. I’ve never been good with eye-gouging. In, stay in, “vile jelly!” I also enjoyed not sitting behind a Bard-bore, chortling loudly because he wants everyone to know that he knows that something is humour. Not too many gags in Lear, to be fair.Not only am I not Michael Billington, as I think I mentioned, I’m not even a Shakespearean scholar, you may be surprised\u0026nbspto hear. I did do King Lear at school, a very long time ago. And that’s enough: I’m in, focused, not wandering (well, not too much). The MMA and the helicopters and the fact that it’s only two hours long all help, but if this Fool can get involved and engage, then anyone can. You don’t even have to be an expert in 21st-century geopolitics (which I am). Have you got – or have you ever had, or are you perhaps – a father? Do you have a family? Of human beings? That’s all you need, and it’s better than The Apprentice.

What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c2bbc132a348fba2cdc30b647ce8a86aab07e/0_3_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05e9b0831cf258f018487bc995f58a7","title":"colombia presidential elections ivan duque gustavo petro runoff","story":"Iván Duque, a fierce critic of the peace accord, will face-off against former mayor of Bogotá Gustavo Petro in second roundColombians have failed to elect a president outright, setting the stage for a bitter runoff between two frontrunners from opposite ends of the political spectrum, while a peace process with leftist rebels hangs in the balance.While voters were united in their distrust of establishment politicians, the campaign highlighted increasing polarisation, with Duque campaigning on a platform of market-friendly economics and Petro criticising the multinational mining companies that operate in the country.Some voters were also worried that with a leftist at the helm could mean their country follows neighbouring Venezuela toward economic ruin – a crisis that has caused more than a million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom many blame for that country’s woes.Sunday’s vote took on extra significance, marking the first presidential elections since a peace deal was reached between the government and leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). That deal formally ended five decades of war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced but failed to win over voters who in late 2016 rejected the deal in a referendum. The peace process was the initiative of outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel peace prize for his achievement.Though the deal was amended and ratified in congress, promises of softer sentencing for rebels and guaranteed seats in congress proved a step too far for many Colombians who saw Sunday’s vote as a second referendum.Duque – now the clear favourite to take the presidency in June – is opposed to the peace deal. His mentor and ally, former president Álvaro Uribe, remains a powerful figure in Colombian politics, having long been fiercely critical of the peace process.Petro once belonged to the long-defunct M-19 guerrilla group and supports the deal. But unless he can convince more moderates to swell his movement, his chances of winning next month are remote.Election day began in a leaden mood beneath a leaden sky, with Santos casting his vote in the courtyard of Bogotá’s magnificent neoclassical Congress building, and addressing reporters. “These are the best-attended elections ever,” he said, “in a country closer to peace than it has ever been.”He was followed, according to tradition, by his predecessor Uribe – whom Santos once served as defence minister but who has become his nemesis. Uribe placed his ballot paper and said: “I have voted for Iván Duque, because of his preparation for office, and his programme for security and respect for the law.” Soon afterwards, in the Asunción district on the edge of his electoral fortress in desperately poor barrios in the south of the city, Gustavo Petro arrived, pressing through crowds of supporters, to vote at the San Lucas school, converted to accommodate polling booths. “Uribe, can you hear us? Petro for president!” they chanted, and: “Gustavo, friend, the people are with you!” The candidate moved through his throng to the booth, accompanied by his daughter Antonella who was wearing the yellow colours of Colombia’s football team. “The future of all our sons and daughters depends on who wins this,” he said. “The more people vote, the more free citizens we will have. I promise a humane Colombia We will improve health and education, challenge corruption and pursue peace.” Duque had earlier voted at the National Institute of Pedagogy, as though to demonstrate the bitter polarisation in this country, proceeding to hear midday Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes church in the historic Chapinero district, where his well-heeled supporters packed the aisles. Duque was whisked in via a rear entrance by his armoured convoy, taking a front pew with his wife, Beatriz. A benediction was sung – bizarrely – to the tune of The Beatles Hey Jude and while the audience sat, upright, Duque lowered his head in prayer, before falling – while others stood – to his knees.The peace accord has had a rocky ride in the run-up to this decisive moment. Clause one commits a government to “integrated rural reform”, while clause four demands the voluntary and enforced eradication, and substitution of coca. Both have met with ferocious opposition: 160 indigenous and land rights leaders have been assassinated, and war rages over coca production between government forces and a mesh of mafia interests and Farc dissidents and other criminal syndicates connected to big landowners. The worst violence is in the Tumaco region on the Pacific coast, the most intensive – and contested – coca-growing region in the world. Duque has consistently refused to uphold both clauses, while Petro and Fajardo are committed to continuing the peace process.A final televised debate on Friday night focused almost entirely on the accord. Duque said it had “bamboozled the Colombians”, while Petro insisted: “The peace is not a problem of negotiation with the guerrillas, but an agreement with society to live without violence.” In a debate the previous evening, Fajardo said, aiming at Duque: “That would be a bad thing: a president who does not want peace.” Out in the countryside, the tension has been palpable. Carlos Castilla is one of those working on the front line of the accord’s implementation, for a ision of the agriculture ministry, helping coca growers substitute their crop with licit alternatives. “Peace”, he said, in the tropical wilderness around Tumaco, “is not something you just sign, it is something you build.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c335a0eb394dbfcb75ef53a8d0e461d6f1f4e68/0_192_3132_1879/master/3132.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c05b1808a1fda2abbb61627e8747ad6","title":"italy president sergio mattarella names interim prime minister carlo cottarelli","story":"Sergio Mattarella asks former IMF economist Carlo Cottarelli to form a governmentItaly’s faith in the eurozone is set to be tested in fresh elections in the autumn after the president, Sergio Mattarella, installed an interim prime minister to lead a new government after a bitter falling out with the country’s populist parties.The political crisis that has engulfed Rome threatens to bring about another bitter battle over the future of the EU, two years after the UK voted for Brexit. The uncertainty promped a selloff on Italian markets on Monday.Mattarella, who as president has the power to nominate the head of government and ministers, asked Carlo Cottarelli, a former International Monetary Fund official, to become interim PM after refusing to accept the nomination of Paolo Savona, a Eurosceptic, for the role of finance minister.Mattarella said appointing Savona, 81, who has called Italy’s entry into the euro a “historic mistake”, would have risked the confidence of foreign investors and destabilising the country. Savona had been put forward for the role by the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League, which had been attempting to form a government. The rejection on Sunday night prompted the resignation of Giuseppe Conte, the two parties’ choice to serve as prime minister.The parties’ leaders, Luigi Di Maio of the M5S and Matteo Salvini of the League, expressed outrage at Mattarella’s intervention and, in an extraordinary move, called for a mass mobilisation against the president on 2 June. Di Maio and others called for Mattarella’s impeachment, a move almost unheard of in Italy, but he later backed off from the threat. “I call citizens to mobilise, make yourselves heard, it’s important that you do it right now. We will organise peaceful and symbolic demonstrations,” Di Maio said. He also called on Italians to drape the Italian flag outside their windows in protest against Mattarella.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, praised Mattarella for showing “great spirit of responsibility” in protecting Italy’s “institutional and democratic stability”. Germany’s Angela Merkel said she would be willing to work with any coalition government in Italy, but economic policy had to be dictated by eurozone rules.Asked whether she was concerned, Merkel said: “Look, when there were elections in Greece and Alexis Tsipras was made premier, there were many questions on the table. We spoke with each other over many, many nights, but together we achieved something. But we have to do that task, since Italy is an important member of the EU,” she said.As high-profile figures in Italy, including former newspaper editors, rallied to Mattarella’s defence, there was a mood of shock and disbelief in Rome. Privately, some analysts who were supportive of Mattarella said it was far from clear whether he had made the right moves and whether his actions would inflame populist sentiment at a fragile moment in Italian history.In brief remarks on Monday, Cottarelli sought to play down the political crisis. “The Italian economy is still growing and public finances are under control,” he said. “Dialogue with the EU to defend our interests is essential and we can do better but it has to be constructive.”At the heart of the fight was Mattarella’s contention that Italy would have sent the wrong message by appointing an anti-euro finance minister. Salvini countered that claim, suggesting he had never called for an exit from the euro, despite having long campaigned for Italy to abandon the eurozone.Mattarella’s move was not the first time a president has vetoed a ministerial nomination. It also occurred under the government of Silvio Berlusconi, but was not considered as controversial.Cottarelli will now attempt to form a technocrat government, made up of ministers who have not been popularly elected. In choosing a former IMF official, Mattarella sought to calm nerves in Brussels and around the world about the rise of anti-EU populism in Italy. But Cottarelli is expected to lose a vote of confidence in the parliament, which will then lead to new elections being called, possibly as early as August.The election is expected to be fought along stark battle lines: whether the country is for or against continued inclusion in the eurozone, at a time when Brussels – and the fiscal constraints it has imposed – is partly blamed for Italy’s stagnant growth and high rate of unemployment.While it is clear that both Di Maio and Salvini have consistently questioned Italy’s place in the eurozone, and will probably campaign in favour of a more combative approach towards Brussels, it is unclear who in Italy’s political class will make a strong case for the EU and the euro.“The cleavage is between those who support sovereignty and those who support Europe. Who will represent the case for Europe? That is the real question,” said Sergio Fabbrini, the director of Luiss School of Government.It is a stunning development less than two weeks after the M5S and the League had agreed a common agenda to form what would have been western Europe’s first populist government.Beppe Grillo, the M5S founder, pointed a finger of blame at the markets. “People do not talk, they are depressed, because there is someone who speaks in the place of millions of Italians: the market today is the pseudonym of the most disheartening capitalism and of predation that we have in Italy,” he wrote on his blog.

He was also offered a job with the Paris sapeurs pompiers, the city’s fire and emergency service.Macron gave Gassama a medal for an act of “bravery and devotion”, signed by the police prefect and declaring the French Republic’s gratitude.Filmed in the gilded reception room of the palace, Gassama hesitantly described seeing the child hanging on to the balcony railing at around 8pm on Saturday when he was on his way out. He had acted “without thinking”, he said.“There were people shouting and honking their horns … I didn’t think of anything, I ran across the road directly to save him. Thank God I saved him.”He said he only realised what he had done after he hauled the child to safety.“My legs went wobbly when I got inside the flat,” he said.Gassama, who has nine brothers and sisters, told BFM TV that when he had the child in his arms he asked “why did you do that?”. But the child did not say anything. Gassama said he only fully realised what he had done when he was in the apartment, looking down.Gassama was accompanied to the palace by his brother Diaby. Asked if he had anything to say to the president, Gassama seemed overwhelmed, so Diaby replied: “We want to be officialised. We have no papers but we want them so we can work in good conditions and we need homes.”Afterwards, faced with a barrage of television cameras and journalists, Gassama seemed lost for words.“He gave me a present,” he said of Macron. “It’s the first time I’ve had anything like this. I’m very happy.”Macron tweeted that in recognition of Gassama’s “heroic act”, his status in France would be made official with a carte de séjour (residency card) “as quickly as possible”. The president also invited Gassama – who has been living without official papers in Paris since he arrived from Mali in September – to put in a request for naturalisation.The interior minister, Gérard Collomb, confirmed that he would personally ensure Gassama’s request would be accepted.The government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux tweeted: “This act of immense bravery, faithful to the values of solidarity of our republic, should open the door to him to our national community.”The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and her deputies vowed to help the young man in his attempts to remain in France.In the footage recorded from the street, a man and woman in the neighbouring flat can be seen spotting the boy from their balcony. The man grabs the child’s right arm but appears unable to pull him to safety because of a iding wall between the balconies.Gassama said he asked the child how he came to be hanging from the balcony in the 18th arrondissement in the north of Paris.“He didn’t answer. I asked where his mother was and he said she had gone to a party,” he told journalists.The father of the child was detained overnight for alleged parental neglect, and is to appear in court in September. Police said the child’s mother was not in Paris at the time of the incident and the boy was now in the care of social services.On Monday, the deputy president of the far-right Front National, Nicolas Bay, sounded a more cynical note about Gassama’s residency status. “If you tell me, we’ll make that one official because of his act of bravery and we’ll expel all the others’, I’ll sign up to that,” Bay told France 2 television.Only a handful of undocumented migrants have their status regularised in France for acts of public service or “exceptional talent”. In 2015, Lassana Bathily, also from Mali, was given asylum after helping hostages taken by the terrorist Amedy Coulibaly at the Hyper-Cacher supermarket, and assisting police and special forces to end the siege.The French documentary maker and commentator Raphaël Glucksmann wrote on his Facebook page: “Like everyone else, I admire the bravery of Mamoudou Gassama. But I dream of a country where it won’t be necessary to put one’s own life at risk scaling a building to save the life of a child in order to be treated like a human being when one is a migrant.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Simon Harris says Bill will be tabled before summer and sent to President by autumnGarda management examining the cost of outfitting members of force

everyone is going to get frustrated.” Photograph: Bryan O’Brien Emma Mhic Mhathúna, one of the women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy, has criticised the Government’s “slow” response to provide financial and other supports promised to affected patients.The Co Kerry-based mother of five has expressed frustration at the failure to make available the package of services that the Government promised the women more than two weeks ago.Ms Mhic Mhathúna told The  that she has been struggling financially and with the logistics of travelling to appointments in Dublin from her home in Ballydavid on the Dingle peninsula.She is one of the 209 women with cervical cancer who were found to have received incorrect smear tests during a clinical audit of past tests by the CervicalCheck screening programme after their cancer diagnoses.The 37 year old is among 162 of those who were only told about the incorrect tests after Limerick woman Vicky Phelan settled her court case against a US laboratory used by the CervicalCheck for the testing.Ms Mhic Mhathúna was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 and was informed last month that a 2013 smear test that indicated no abnormalities was later found to be incorrect.On May 11th, the Government announced a package of services for the women including medical cards, counselling and psychology supports, reimbursement of medicines and treatments, childcare and travel costs.Other women caught up in the controversy and relatives of some of the 18 women among the 209 who have died have also complained on a private online social media group about the delay in supports being made available, the lack of a co-ordinated response to the controversy and being drip-fed information.A spokeswoman for the Health Service Executive said the process to issue the package of supports to the women begins immediately once they have met a HSE executive.Ms Mhic Mhathúna was scheduled to meet a HSE executive at her home on Monday evening.Speaking after meeting the HSE representative, Ms Mhic Mhathúna said the HSE was planning to pay for medical and travel expenses directly and to reimburse the women for childcare and other costs but that it would take weeks to set up the system.Ahead of that meeting, she criticised the slow response and complained about having to travel to Dublin again this week for a gynaecological appointment as part of her High Court case against the US laboratory that carried out her test.“Nobody knows what they are doing, it is not co-ordinated and what is going to happen is, everyone is going to get frustrated,” she said.Last week she said she had to take her children out of school, drive to Kilkenny where she had her children looked after and then travel on to Dublin the next day, repeating the journey again on her return to Kerry.The travels have taken a toll financially and physically on the terminally ill woman, she said.“Even if it was a reimbursed scheme, I am not capable of doing these long drives it is actually dangerous fatigue is the biggest symptom it’s the most difficult to manage,” she said.“You can’t be dying and driving at the same time, not with children in the car.”Ms Mhic Mhathúna called on the Government to assign someone to co-ordinate issuing the package of supports to the women.“I understand the Government has been focusing on the referendum but they can assign somebody to do the work for them,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has

basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon. Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.  Video: Kathleen Harris Enda O\u0027Dowd \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA single rose is held aloft at Dublin Castle as the crowd gathered to celebrate the Yes vote. Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Huseyin AldemirFor a country with declining democratic credentials, Turkey’s politicians have shown remarkable interest in asking the public for its say.Local and presidential elections in 2014, two general elections in 2015 and a referendum to change the constitution last year speak of politics consistently involving the people. Next month, snap parliamentary and presidential elections originally scheduled for next year will see Turks go to the polls once again – the fifth time in as many years.For 15 years, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the AK Party he unofficially heads have swept all before them. Now, however, opposition parties have opted to unite, and an alliance of four parties will take on the AK Party and its nationalist backers, the MHP, in the parliamentary poll on June 24th.Titled the Nation Alliance, the opposition bloc includes the CHP, IYI (Good) party, the Felicity party and Democrat party, and has vowed to repeal a state of emergency that followed an abortive coup in July 2016, and return Turkey to a parliamentary system of governance.Whether the large number of bruising electoral campaigns has contributed to a more polarised country, or is simply a sign of democracy at work has been foremost in voters’ minds.“I don’t think the people are tired of elections, but they do not trust the security of the elections. So, this feeling of insecurity is pushing the opposition community to show their reaction with their ballots,” says Cenap Kuzuoglu, a restaurateur in Istanbul’s Kadikoy neighbourhood, who says he will “probably” vote for the CHP’s presidential candidate, Muharrem Ince.“Turkey is definitely bleeding, but is still within the limits of democracy. Whether the country will be able to keep that remains to be seen in the coming decade,” he says.Absent from the four-party Nation Alliance is the Kurdish-focused HDP, one of only four parties currently represented in parliament and whose co-chairman and presidential candidate, Selahattin Demirtas, has been detained for the past 19 months on charges of supporting terrorism.But some say leaving the HDP out may work in the opposition alliance’s favour as it takes away the government’s ability to cast it as supporting Kurdish “terrorism”, a charge frequently repeated in the media and widely believed by millions of Turks.Baybars Orsek, founder of the independent fact-checking website Dogruluk Payi, which translates as Piece of Truthand which has been monitoring Turkish politicians’ statements since June 2014, says candidates become less truthful around election time.“According to the breakdown of more than 1,500 fact-checks from almost 500 different political actors in the country, the truthfulness of Turkish politicians is lower in campaign cycles compared to other times. We find a factual error in every one of five statements, and political parties are very much alike in their accuracy,” he says.When prime minister and AK Party head Binali Yildirim claimed at a campaign rally this month that his party had put forward the most number of female nominees in the upcoming election, Orsek’s team pointed out that four other parties have more.Orsek says the economic situation, which has seen inflation eat away at people’s spending power, is a major concern for voters. “The lira’s deprecation has been affecting small and medium business for a long time,” he says.Erdogan’s AK Party remains a formidable force. It has wheeled out big-name cabinet ministers on its election ticket to present as strong a line-up as possible. It seized on this month’s killings of Palestinians protesters in Gaza by rallying thousands to a square in Istanbul, a move that served as an election event as much as a protest against the killings. In a two-hour speech on May 24th, Erdogan acknowledged the important role first-time voters would play and struck a mostly conciliatory tone.Surveys suggest the government has successfully linked the lira’s sinking value and high inflation to an attack by outsiders bent on ousting the president. A number of people approached on Istanbul streets who identified as AK Party supporters refused to offer their thoughts on the election.The challenges facing the opposition next month are not limited to a lack of airtime (Erdogan refused an invitation from a rival candidate to take part in a TV debate). That the parties making up the opposition alliance range from centre-left to far-right may see it spread too thinly.Television coverage of the campaigns has focused almost entirely on the president and ruling party, which has continued a crackdown on suspected opponents. More than 100 journalists languish in jail. “While we have not faced any direct pressure from the government,” says Orsek, “the lack of plurality in Turkish traditional media is limiting our work to mostly digital and alternative media”.With Erdogan last year having won a referendum that granted him more power by just 2 per cent, campaigning over the coming weeks is expected to grow increasingly tense."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3511672.1527529233!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the real cost of brexit all the things that are not being done","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit: “Central to politics is the picking of battles, and Britain has picked an all-absorbing one.” Photograph:  Stefan RousseauPA Wire The signatories of a recent letter to Theresa May must have daunted even that sceptic of the business lobby. The CBI, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Small Business Federation and the EFF, the manufacturers’ organisation, want the UK prime minister to “get on” with the enlargement of Heathrow airport. A vote had been planned before parliament’s summer recess in July. If the deadline passes, the dread is a political class too lost in the next stage of Brexit to address the footling matter of national (in Heathrow’s case, global) infrastructure.Notice what the employers fear is trickling away here: not support for their cause, but the time and space for it. May wants an expanded Heathrow. The Conservatives made it a manifesto pledge last year. The parliamentary votes can, with effort, be assembled. What troubles business is Brexit’s potential to crowd out the project, as it does so much else.The parable of Heathrow illuminates Britain’s predicament since 2016. History might come to record the real cost of Brexit as all the other things not done. A generation of MPs, civil servants and public intellectuals are engaged with one open-ended mission. It is where they must spend their energies and political capital.People who entered public service to reform the economy or see the National Health Service through the costly dotage of the baby boomers will lose vital years to the dry work of unmooring from the EU and recreating the best bits of it. Even if the direct cost of exit turns out to be as exaggerated as Leavers suggest, the opportunity cost is, if anything, underplayed.A sense of those forgone opportunities is free to read online. In Square Deal, the Conservative MP Nick Boles has written a programme for national renewal that touches on healthcare, housing and employment. His muse is the US presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, who neutered the appeal of America’s early 20th-century populists with his own blend of active government, popular capitalism and assertiveness abroad. There is in Square Deal the filling, not just the outlines, of an electable form of Toryism.The difference is that Roosevelt’s federal government was not occupied with a huge constitutional project. Reformers closer to home, namely the prime ministers Clement Attlee (after 1945) and Margaret Thatcher (in the 1980s), had the same good fortune to govern while the basic rules of state did not constitute a distraction. The next prime minister who will be able to do the same is probably not in parliament yet.It is possible that the “next election will not be defined by Brexit”, as Boles predicts, but the business of state still might be. Twelve years passed between Britain’s first application to join the European project in 1961 and its ultimate accession in 1973. It would be no shock if, in 2028, 12 years after the vote to leave, Britain were still negotiating features of its relationship with an EU that is itself in flux.The political, diplomatic, technical and intellectual work that goes into the management of this bilateral tie will allow for few other undertakings of real weight. And even this does not budget for the emotional rawness of an electorate that is ided on the matter. Would the nation tolerate another round of isive change on, say, housing?Leavers will contest this neat line between constitutional change and the “real” work of government. They see the EU’s curbs on a member state’s freedom of action as the true block on domestic reform. A bold government must be sovereign in the first place. But even leaving aside the obvious rejoinder (which Thatcherite idea was stymied by Brussels?), there are only so many hours in a day and only so many high-risk ventures the public will bear in one phase of history. Central to politics is the picking of battles, and Britain has picked an all-absorbing one.It is a lapse into mawkishness to say that the best minds of their generation are being wasted on a fool’s errand. The best minds are not in parliament, Whitehall or the commentariat. Nor can anyone be certain that Brexit will look foolish in a decade’s time. What is going to waste is what the modern argot obliges us to call “bandwidth”.Britain has not the time or energy for much besides Brexit. It volunteered for a new challenge before fixing such old ones as productivity and infrastructure. If a third runway at Heathrow is to be a good idea postponed, it will not be the only one.These are the Lost Years. We can but guess how many of them there will be, and what we might have done with them instead. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares.

Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security TV news crew killed covering subtropical storm Alberto as it hits US mainlandEU to deploy observers to Zimbabwe election for first time in 16 yearsRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedHero teacher who stopped shooter says he had to save studentsHealth \u0026#39time bomb\u0026#39 of 22,000 children who are severely obese at 11Robots are better than doctors at diagnosing some cancers, major study findsDutch court rules that it is time to recognise a third genderRegular meetings ruin productivity as workers worry about running late, study saysMartha Kearney says she experienced \u0026#39horrible and humiliating\u0026#39 sexual harassment as young reporterSalisbury doctors did not believe Skripals would survive Novichok poisoning  Britain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 1: A technical fault, Dec without Ant, and a worthy winner of the public voteBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenItaly\u0026#39s thwarted populists\u0026#39 fury at EU financial and political establishment NHS guilty of \u0026#39ridiculous waste of resources\u0026#39 and could improve care without spending a penny more, top medic says Robots will never rise up against humans because they will be part of the family, AI expert saysA vision to bring glasses to the developing worldRecord-breaking driver who drove length of Britain in nine hours \u0026#39should be prosecuted for speeding\u0026#39Woman escapes armed boyfriend after passing note to dog\u0026#39s vet Former Pakistan spy chief grounded for suggesting Pakistan government knew about Bin Laden raidWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000164689909_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hailstones size pigeon eggs devastate bordeaux vineyards","story":"A violent storm left vines damaged and without leaves in this vineyard in Macau, near Bordeaux Hailstorms have devastated thousands of acres of prime Bordeaux vineyards, prompting the French government to promise support for winegrowers, some of whom have lost their entire crop.Cyril Giresse, a winegrower, said hailstones “the size of pigeons’ eggs” destroyed grape buds and left vines bare on Saturday.“The storm lasted only about 15 minutes, but in some places, there’s nothing left at all,” said Mr Giresse, who runs the Château Gravettes Samonac in Bordeaux’s Côtes de Bourg appellation. “No leaves, no grapes, just the vines stripped as if the grapes had all been picked.”Jean-Dominique Château, another claret producer, said: “I’ve got nothing left. I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter. Estates hit by frost last year will not recover. We’re going to need a lot of support and solidarity.”Saint-Emilion, one of the most prestigious Bordeaux appellations, was spared, but parts of Médoc were badly hit, as were Cognac brandy producers in the Charente and Charente-Maritime departments.Didier Gontier, director of the Côtes de Bourg appellation, said: “Winegrowers say they’ve got no vines left for next year so this is going to affect two years of production.”  Bordeaux produces more than 700 million bottles of claret a year,Bordeaux is France’s largest wine-growing area, with about 300,000 acres of vineyards producing more than 700 million bottles of claret a year, ranging from cheap table wines to some of the world’s most acclaimed and expensive vintages.French wine and spirits exports amounted to more than £11 billion last year. Wine industry leaders have opposed moves to tighten 1991 laws restricting alcohol advertising. President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policyTV news crew killed covering subtropical storm Alberto as it hits US mainlandEU to deploy observers to Zimbabwe election for first time in 16 yearsRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedHero teacher who stopped shooter says he had to save studentsHealth \u0026#39time bomb\u0026#39 of 22,000 children who are severely obese at 11Robots are better than doctors at diagnosing some cancers, major study findsDutch court rules that it is time to recognise a third genderRegular meetings ruin productivity as workers worry about running late, study saysMartha Kearney says she experienced \u0026#39horrible and humiliating\u0026#39 sexual harassment as young reporterSalisbury doctors did not believe Skripals would survive Novichok poisoning  Britain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 1: A technical fault, Dec without Ant, and a worthy winner of the public voteBritish circus trainer fights to keep beloved elephant in her Spanish gardenItaly\u0026#39s thwarted populists\u0026#39 fury at EU financial and political establishment NHS guilty of \u0026#39ridiculous waste of resources\u0026#39 and could improve care without spending a penny more, top medic says Robots will never rise up against humans because they will be part of the family, AI expert saysA vision to bring glasses to the developing worldRecord-breaking driver who drove length of Britain in nine hours \u0026#39should be prosecuted for speeding\u0026#39Woman escapes armed boyfriend after passing note to dog\u0026#39s vet Former Pakistan spy chief grounded for suggesting Pakistan government knew about Bin Laden raidWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164821264_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside luxury canadian cabin meghan harry rumoured have chosen","story":"Canoes at the Beauvert Lake boathouse at the Fairmont Jasper Park LodgeIf there’s one thing royal-watchers love more than a royal wedding, it’s a royal honeymoon, and the travel and celebrity press is abuzz with rumours about precisely where newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will choose to be holed up with Netflix and champagne. There were rumours of a mini-moon in Ireland, in all likelihood at the gloriously eccentric 18th manor Ballyfin Demesne, where Kim Kardashian and Kanye West honeymooned in 2015. Namibia was also hotly tipped, with a specific nod to Hoanib Valley Camp, a luxury tented conservation-oriented camp in a particularly remote corner of a lesser-visited African destination.

He applied to renew the visa in April but did not immediately receive approval from the Home Office amid diplomatic tension between London and Moscow.It is unclear if the UK decided to reject his application permanently but a source familiar with the matter told The Daily  that the renewal process seemed to be taking an unusually long time.Amber Rudd ordered a review of the visa status of wealthy Russians after the Salisbury nerve agent attackMr Abramovich is believed to have returned to Russia after his visa expired. He did not attend Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup at Wembley on May 19.Israeli passport holders can travel to Britain without a visa for short periods of time, and can stay as long as six months. Russians must apply for a visa from the British Embassy in Moscow if they wish to travel to Britain.Mr Abramovich\u0027s decision comes after the Government suggested it would take a harder line on Russian oligarchs in Britain following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.His private G650 jet touched down at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Monday and he was immediately granted Israeli citizenship. A spokesman for the Israeli interior ministry said he applied at the Israeli embassy in Moscow and was found eligible for citizenship after proving his Jewish heritage. “He filed a request to receive an immigration permit, his documents were checked according to the Law of Return, and he was indeed found eligible,” the spokesman told Israel’s Channel 10 news. Mr Abramovich previously purchased a £17.1 mansion in Tel Aviv’s upmarket Neve Tzedek neighbourhood.

In adults, a BMI of 40 or above means a person is severely obese, at least 60 per cent higher than the upper healthy weight BMI limit of 24.9.The first data of its kind for 2016-17, obtained by the LGA and supplied by the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP), show that a total of 22,646 out of 556,452 10 and 11-year-olds (4.1 per cent) are classed as severely obese. For children aged four and five, reception class age, the figure is 14,787 out of 629,359 in total (2.35 per cent).Severe obesity rates are highest in children living in the most deprived towns and cities, and those from BME groups, which the LGA suggested shows a need for more targeted interventions.Despite budget reductions, it said councils were spending more on running effective prevention schemes to help children stay healthy, which is key to tackling the child obesity crisis and reducing future costs to hospital, health and social care services.The Daily Mile: Is this the solution to the child obesity crisis?But it added that this work, including the ability of councils to provide weight management services for children and adults, is being hampered by a £600 million reduction in councils’ public health budgets by central government between 2015-16 and 2019-20. The LGA is calling for reductions in public health grants to be reversed by the Government and for further reforms to tackle childhood obesity. This includes councils having a say in how and where the soft drinks levy is spent, better labelling on food and drink products, and for councils to be given powers to ban junk food advertising near schools.Councillor Izzi Seccombe, chairman of the LGA’s Community Wellbeing Board, said the figures represented a “further worrying wake-up call”.“Unless we tackle this obesity crisis, today’s obese children will become tomorrow’s obese adults whose years of healthy life will be shortened by a whole host of health problems including diabetes, cancer and heart disease,” she said. “Cuts to councils’ public health grants are having a significant impact on the many prevention and early intervention services carried out by councils to combat child obesity.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Our childhood obesity plan is among the most comprehensive in the world – our sugar tax is funding school sports programmes and nutritious breakfasts for the poorest children, and we’re investing in further research into the links between obesity and inequality.“However, we have always been very clear that this is the not the final word on obesity, and we have not ruled out further action if the right results are not seen.”Please review our commenting policyTV news crew killed covering subtropical storm Alberto as it hits US

primary school, new figures show. The number of 10- and 11-year-olds in year six classed as severely obese is almost double that of the four- and five-year-olds in reception year, analysis from the Local Government Association (LGA) has found.The LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, has warned the high child obesity rates are contributing to a “multi-billion pound ill-health time bomb”.Obese people should start work later to ease rush-hour anxietyIt said the figures should serve as a “worrying wake-up call” for concerted action to tackle the obesity crisis, which is costing the NHS more than £5bn every year.Severe obesity rates are highest in children living in the most-deprived towns and cities, and those from black and minority ethnic groups, which the LGA suggested shows a need for more targeted interventions.The data for 201617, supplied by the National Child Measurement Programme, shows 22,646 out of 556,452 (4.1 per cent) 10- and 11-year-olds are

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We have still got to conclude the defence modernisation programme, but you would need to move north of 2.5 per cent to make any of this work, if you want to retain the same defence posture given the dangers, the complexities of the world that we face.”A study commissioned by Downing Street last year warned that all three branches of the military were “running to a standstill” as they struggle to recruit enough personnel to replace those leaving.The government’s decision to outsource army recruitment to contracting giant Capita has drawn fire, with a wider crisis blamed on a “flawed austerity drive” launched in 2012.The armed forces’ pay review body has already submitted its 2018 recommendations to the government, which are said to include a 3 per cent pay increase. A MoD spokesperson said the independent body’s findings were still being considered and an announcement would be made in due course.Military pay rises have been frozen or capped at 1 per cent a year since 2010 and while the government lifted the public sector pay cap in September, an announcement on the armed forces was delayed.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPeople play cricket in front of Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland.Chris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

Though expensive enough for single people, couples and families living abroad can easily find themselves spending many thousands of pounds on a citizenship application once the UK’s charges for leaving are taken into account. The department says the sharp increase reflects an increased cost of handling applications – at the same time as British people applying for foreign passports surged.Figures from EU statistics agency Eurostat show the number of British people seeking the citizenship of other countries had increased by 165 per cent in the year of the referendum compared with the previous year. Inidual figures from other countries show a sustained increase in similar applications throughout 2017.Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to makeMichael Harris, British in EuropeThe increase was sharpest for some countries that ban dual citizenship: the number of British people adopting Dutch passports increased from 166 British citizens in 2015 to 636 in the year of the referendum, a 283 per cent increase. Though the Dutch government is changing the law to allow Dutch citizens living in Britain to adopt dual citizenship – to cushion them from the referendum result – no such exemption has been made for British citizens living in the Netherlands.Campaigners said the move to hike the fees had added to the “painful” decision many British people had taken to renounce their nationality, which most only did because they feel they have no other option to secure their future.“The increase will just add to the difficulties people face in countries like the Netherlands which do not allow dual nationality,” said Michael Harris, a Briton living abroad and a member of the British in Europe steering committee.“Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to make.”Countdown to Brexit: what is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “This is the Conservative Brexit government and the Home Office giving Brits in the EU the last kick out the door. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In the same period wages have increased by just 6 per cent, suggesting the scheme is increasingly helping only those with higher incomes.The average household income in the UK is £25,700, although this is after direct taxes have been deducted, whereas the Help to Buy data relates to pre-tax wages.Last year £2.9bn of loans were paid out – a jump from £2.1bn the year before. Despite criticism of where the money is going, Theresa May has promised a further £10bn of investment in the scheme – enough to help fund more than 400,000 new homes.Labour said the figures were proof that Help to Buy is not helping those who most need support with housing costs.The world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThe world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThis is the fifth year that Melbourne has won top placeJohn Healey, the party’s shadow housing secretary, said: “With the number of younger people who own a first home in free fall, government ministers need to be doing much more to help people on ordinary incomes buy a first home of their own.“Deep cuts to housing investment mean that the number of new low-cost homes to buy like shared ownership have halved since 2010, and badly targeted schemes like Help to Buy aren’t focused on those who most need a hand up.“Labour would refocus Help to Buy to help first-time buyers on ordinary incomes.”It comes after the Resolution Foundation suggested Help to Buy should be scrapped, saying it drives up house prices and takes money away from other areas of housing.The average new build property now costs £50,000 more than when the scheme was introduced in 2013, it said.The think tank said in a report: “HTB appears to have served a useful purpose when it was first introduced – restoring confidence to developers and promoting a pickup in house building. But its effect looks increasingly distortionary, suggesting that it may be time to phase it out.”It added: “Since early 2016 the growth in new-build prices has outpaced price growth for existing resold property, strongly suggesting that equity loans have enabled developers to set prices at higher levels than otherwise.”In the meantime, it said, a household income cap should be introduced on Help to Buy loans to ensure public money is benefiting people on low and middle incomes.Number of social housing properties in England drops 11 per cent in one yearOfficial data reveals that the scheme, designed to help aspiring homeowners get on the housing ladder, also continues to directly benefit thousands of people who already own a property.Almost one in five Help to Buy beneficiaries are already homeowners, and on average these recipients are wealthier than first-time buyers, with an income £8,500 higher.The Independent has previously revealed how millions of pounds of public funds are being loaned to people with an income of more than £100,000.The latest figures reveal that more than 6,200 households with an income of more than £100,000 have benefited from taxpayer-funded loans.A spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Our Help to Buy scheme has assisted over 440,000 people buy a home of their own since 2010, with a majority of households having an income of £50,000 or less.“Help to Buy is getting people onto the housing ladder and last year we saw the highest number of first time buyers in over a decade.”help to buyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

KRCR News 7 reported that the school contracted with China\u0027s civil aviation authority to train its new pilots, one of whom was apparently Tianshu Shi.Man caught on camera threatening to deport Spanish speaking staffMr Shi told reporters that he had been in the United States for about seven months - living with several other IASCO trainees at an apartment in Redding. It was there, police said, that McConkey and Hoser came for the student.The pair first showed up at the apartment on Thursday night, according to a police statement. They allegedly informed Mr Shi that they were sending him back to China and would return in the morning.Police have not explained why anyone would want Mr Shi gone from the country. An unrelated lawsuit, filed last year by a former instructor, alleges that some of IASCO\u0027s Chinese students spoke so little English that they could not safely fly - that one had nearly crashed into another plane because he had misunderstood his teacher\u0027s instructions.Pilot jailed for killing estranged wife with saucepanThose allegations predate Mr Shi\u0027s training, however. And the lawsuit does not mention Hoser or McConkey, who is reportedly a 48-year-old manager at the school.Police say the two returned to Mr Shi\u0027s apartment around dawn on Friday to carry out their would-be deportation.When Mr Shi refused to go with them, police said, McConkey battered him and threatened physical violence.McConkey grabbed Mr Shi roughly by the arm, the student told the Record Searchlight, and said he needed to get on a plane now or face worse violence.He\u0027s very rude, a visibly shaken Mr Shi recalled to the newspaper.

The spat led to the collapse of talks to form a M5SLeague coalition government.Mr Mattarella has asked former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Carlo Cottarelli to form a new technocrat government. The economist, 64, is known as “Mr Scissors” for his cuts to Italy’s public spending. Italy’s political crisis could have devastating effects on the euroMr Cottarelli will look to present a programme to parliament, including a budget, and aim for elections early next year. However, it is unlikely he will gain the support of the parliament, meaning elections would be pushed forward to August this year.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, which was part of the right-wing coalition that gained 37 per cent of the vote in the March elections, and the M5S’s Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the single biggest inidual share of the vote, have both switched to campaign mode and have called for protests against the decision by Mr Mattarella.Early elections would suit both parties, with Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio, having made much of the narrative that the Italian and wider European establishment are getting in the way of the will of the Italian people. There were reports on Monday that M5S may even consider campaigning with the League in any new vote.

A tax fraud conviction prevented Mr Berlusconi, who served multiple terms as Italian prime minister, from running for office in March. A Milan court ruled this month that he is now eligible, and he suggested on Monday he is open to running for office in new elections. However, Mr Diamanti says that the “X-factor” of the League, which was a regional, Northern Italy secessionist party, is having turned into a nationalist, anti-immigrant and eurosceptic party. “Now that the League is the Italian version of French Front National (FN), Mr Salvini is the one that capitalises on people’s rage the most,” Mr Diamanti said. And Mr Salvini seems to be aware of that: “I’m very angry”, he wrote on Facebook a few days ago, referring to the decisions from Mr Mattarella, before blaming “Paris, Brussels and the financial system”. As Italy prepares for new elections, whenever they come, Mr Mattarella’s move of rejecting the eurosceptic economist Mr Savona might end up opening up a route for the populists to gain even more votes than before.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.“No one can claim that I have stood in the way of the formation of the so-called government for change.”The president’s decision forced Giuseppe Conte to step down as proposed premier.Mr Conte, a law professor and political novice who supports Five Star, had been nominated to be prime minister by Mr Di Maio and League leader Matteo Salvini.The two party heads had set aside a rivalry to open talks over forging a coalition, but each refused to back the other to lead the government.Italy’s populist coalition government poses new threat to eurozonePresident Mattarella summoned former IMF senior official Carlo Cottarelli for a meeting on Monday and appointed him as stopgap prime minister, tasked with trying to form a technocratic government and ending weeks of political and constitutional turmoil.Mr Cottarelli, known as “Mr Scissors” for making cuts to public spending, is likely to prove a calming choice for the financial markets, which tumbled last week amid fears the mooted coalition would unleash a spending splurge and increase Italy’s already huge debt mountain.But his appointment is likely to be only a short-term solution ahead of probable elections in the autumn.Polls have suggested that the League, which won 17 per cent of the vote in March, would see its support surge in a new ballot, while support for Five Star remains strong. Mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties were seen losing further ground in the face of voter anger over the sluggish economy.“If we’re not free to decide, better to go back to vote,” Mr Salvini told a rally of League supporters on Sunday.He added: “If there’s not the OK of Berlin, Paris or Brussels, in Italy a government cannot be formed. It’s a folly, and I ask the Italian people to stay close to us because I want to bring democracy back to this country.”The two populist parties have proposed to lower taxes, roll back planned pensions cuts and increase welfare spending, at a cost of tens of billions of euros.Their agreed joint programme also pledges to repatriate irregular migrants and block landlords from hosting those who have crossed the Mediterranean to safety.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A word from the Editor by MARTIN TOWNSEND                Labour\u0026rsquos FAILED project: Unite try to SAVE Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos GlastonburyI\u0027m not surprised there is a growing clamour, even from people who voted Leave, to say we want to be able to reconsider because Brexit\u0027s turning out to be somewhat different from what was promised by the Leave campaign, said Mr Corbett, who is leader of Labour\u0027s MEPs.Far from being in lots of money that would all go to the NHS, it\u0027s costing an arm and a leg. Far from helping our economy, it is damaging it.Far from having easy new trade deals with the rest of the world that is looking rather dodgy and unlikely, or at least not on terms that would be beneficial to Britain.So it\u0027s not surprising people are saying it is all very well to vote for Brexit as a general principle but we want a say on the actual Brexit deal once we can see what it really entails - that\u0027s not an unreasonable request, he said.All of Labour\u0027s 20 MEPs backed the idea that Brexit should be reconsidered.At this stage the Labour Party has not called for a second referendum because we\u0027re still in the phase of discovering where the ided government is going.But the Labour movement hasn\u0027t ruled it out either.If we are faced with a Brexit deal that the Government brings back which is manifestly damaging for Britain which is rejected by the House of Commons and you have a ratification crisis, we\u0027ve said the House of Commons should then determine where we then go next.Mr Corbett said that if a majority of MPs did not approve any treaty agreed by Mrs May, the Commons could send the Government back to Brussels to try to renegotiate it.Read the full 7,000-word agreement on the Brexit deal                    EPA1 of 17Here is the 15 page Brexit deal in fullWe\u0027ve said the House of Commons should then determine where we go next and of course one of the options, one of the options say go away and negotiate something different or better. Another option is to reconsider Brexit, he said, adding: It\u0027s a democratic principle - you must have the right to reconsider. I\u0027m very sympathetic to that point of view.He claimed Labour\u0027s frontbench had not reached a position on whether to try to force a second referendum vote.All Labour\u0027s 20 MEPs backed the idea that Brexit should be reconsidered, Mr Corbett said.Speaking knowing the opinion of many, I think of all my fellow MEPs, all I can say is that there is a lot of sympathy for the view that if the deal comes back is a bad isive costly bad for Britain deal, it\u0027s not unreasonable to say that there should be a chance to reconsider it, he said.He also pledged to press the case for reconsidering Brexit within Labour\u0027s shadow cabinet.There\u0026rsquos a lot of lively debates in the Labour Party around the Shadow Cabinet table, which I attend, he said.Mr Corbett also distanced himself from claims from some Labour frontbenchers that the party will back Government plans to quit the EU customs union.Leaving the customs union is rather job destroying, bad for our economy we should remake sure we remain in a customs union, he said.It\u0027s feared the UK\u0026rsquos transition deal with the European Union will leave the its fishing industry at the EU\u0027s mercy                    PA1 of 7UK fishermen fear the EU will impose laws that shrink British fishing fleets Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: \u0026ldquoLabour are only interested in frustrating Brexit.\u0026ldquoThe fact that such a senior Labour figure is openly speculating about reversing Brexit entirely shows they do not respect the referendum result, and they couldn\u0026rsquot deliver the change British people voted for.\u0026ldquoOnly the Conservatives have a plan for Brexit which means taking back control of our laws, borders and money, while Labour\u0026rsquos approach would get us the worst possible deal.Research recently published by the Tories found that senior Labour figures have backed or failed to rule out a second referendum at least 40 times in recent months even though aides insist Mr Corbyn is not in favour of such a poll.Commons could send the Government back to Brussels to try to renegotiate.As Labour\u0027s leader in Brussels and Strasbourg, Mr Corbett is believed to be influential on the party\u0027s European policy.Keir Starmer, the shadow EU exit secretary, recently said: Richard is one of our brilliant MEPs, he\u0026rsquos also effectively a member of my shadow team now.

Nobody joins the Armed Forces for the money as such, but we must avoid pay being an issue as to why they would be deterred from it.Speaking as the Ministry of Defence conducts a defence review which is battling to balance funding for conventional forces with the need to tackle new threats such as cyber warfare, Mr Ellwood added: \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a pay rise. We have still got to conclude the defence modernisation programme but you would need to move north of 2.5 per cent to make any of this work.A Ministry of Defence survey revealed low morale in the Armed Forces, with one in five satisfied.Mr Ellwood\u0026rsquos comments put renewed pressure on Chancellor Philip Hammond, a former defence secretary, to pump more money into the Armed Forces.

Last September the Government announced it was lifting the pay cap.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for good.The free-trading “global Britain” Mrs May has repeatedly made central to her vision of our future will be dead.Her entire Department for International Trade will be redundant.Incredibly, we would be inviting Brussels to run the trade policy of the world’s fifth biggest economy forever — even after we have supposedly “left” the EU.And we would have NO say in it.This is not the minor detail Remainers want you to believe. It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it.

Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home. It’s a start. But it’s not enough.Russia, as Boris Johnson rightly says, has a “disregard for innocent life” and “believes it can act with impunity”.And no wonder, when the cream of world football is about to help it showcase its hospitality for a month.It is shameful Russia was never stripped of the World Cup.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am everything and nothing. This has big advantages. Every day is different.”He describes himself as being in a “domestic partnership” since January 2015.A PayPal account he advertises on social media where he urges people to “send money to Jesus” currently stands at zero.A spokesman added that any complaint would normally be lodged with a local court who would then send officials to notify squatters they must leave.A source said: In most cases the court officials go alone. They usually don’t call for police back-up.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409381089.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"wh smiths uk worst high street shop 2018","story":"The chain has been ranked in the bottom two for the eighth consecutive year, with critics slamming its poor customer service, bad value for money and generally dire state of its stores.The annual survey by consumer champion Which? comes after the retailer was slammed for selling £1 toothpaste for £8 in its hospital outlets.One customer told Which?: “I find WH Smith very expensive and its stores need updating.”Another said: “I always use the self-service tills because the staff are rude.”Another shopper summed up the retailer’s troubles, branding it “hugely inferior to what it was in the past”.Which? asked more than 10,000 shoppers about their shopping experience at 100 major retailers.The customer scores given are based on customers’ experiences of purchasing non-grocery items, their satisfaction levels and the likelihood of recommending each shop.Lush, Savers and Smyths Toys have been named the highest ranking shops a huge leap for three retailers that didn’t even manage last year’s top 10.Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the “friendly and cheerful” staff at Smyths Toys.Last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds are now in fourth and sixth place, respectively.Despite only dropping by two percentage points, John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place - its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010.But the department store’s strength as an all-rounder was still evident, as it snatched the top spot in four categories - appliances and electronics, furniture and home, outdoor and sports and wellbeing and beauty.Price proved to be a deciding factor for many consumers - particularly when it came to everyday essentials - pushing stores like Savers up the rankings.Which? saw a similar trend in its recent supermarket survey, which this year saw Aldi overtake Waitrose for the first time in three years, proving that customers are sometimes willing to sacrifice their overall shopping experience if it means getting better value for money.Clintons- 60%Evans - 63%= Sport Direct - 63%Homebase/Bunnings - 64%JD Sports - 65%= Toys R Us/Babies R Us - 65%Dorothy Perkins/Burton - 66%= Halfords (inc Cycle Republic) - 66%= Miss Selfridge - 66%= Ryman- 66%Lush - 81%= Savers - 81%= Smyths Toys - 81%Screwfix - 80%= Toolstation - 80%Bodycare - 79%= Richer Sounds - 79%The Perfume Shop - 78%= Waterstones - 78%The Body Shop - 77%= Dunhelm 77%= Ikea 77%= John Lewis 77%Describing their bugbears of shopping in store, shoppers said they are put off by crowds (49%), queueing (49%) as well as the behaviour of other shoppers (38%).While some high street retailers are thinking up new ways to entice customers into their stores, others are struggling. In the past few months alone, two of the stores in the survey, Toys R Us and Maplin, have gone into administration.Others such as Mothercare and Laura Ashley have issued profit warnings, New Look has requested rent cuts, Debenhams is slashing staff numbers and announced an 85% drop in profits, while Carpetright has announced the closure of around a quarter of its stores.Some Laura Ashley, Mothercare and Debenhams customers told Which? that although these stores offered a good range and good quality items, they thought value for money was poor unless it was during the sales.In contrast, shoppers praised the cheap and cheerful nature of New Look stores but one shopper told Which? the “stores could be a bit tidier”.WH Smith was also attacked on social media, with one writing: Its been an awful, shamelessly overpriced shop for years.Another commented: Its a chocolate shop pretending to be a stationary shop. They are just terrible.Ben Clissitt, Which? Magazine Editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”The Sun Online has contacted WH Smith for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409405620.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hand held shower head removed mans bum","story":"The 26-year-old, from India, had to detach the PVC pipe connecting the shower head to the wall to get to hospital.Upon admission to Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in New Delhi the man denied he had put the shower head there himself.His vitals were stable and there was no evidence of blood in his rectum, according to the BMJ case report.Scans revealed the shower head was six inches deep into the mans pelvis, but had not caused any internal damage.The man was put under general anaesthesia while doctors removed the object.No serious damage had been caused and the man was allowed home 48 hours later.The report notes how the correct size, material and number of objects needs to be determined before treatment can proceed.And suggests some patients need psychiatric consultation.A proper history and examination is mandatory to look for signs and symptoms of perforation and infection, such as fever, severe abdominal pain and bleeding, Dr Peeyush Kumar wrote in the case report.History is often ambiguous and incomplete due to a high level of embarrassment and social stigma attached to the condition. The same was seen in our case.Though the patient reported accidental insertion of the shower head and denied voluntary insertion, there is a high suspicion of voluntary insertion for auto-erotic purpose.It is not the first time a foreign object has had to be removed from a rectum.In fact, its surprisingly common.A large variety of objects have been reported, including bottles, cans, glass bulbs, stones, small rods, fruits and vegetables, vibrators, dildos and toys, Dr Kumar added.Insertion of objects for auto-erotic purposes is the most common cause of rectal foreign bodies.Other common causes include accidents and assaults. The presentation is often delayed, and history is often improper.Two-thirds of the patients are males in their 30s or 40s, who use such objects for auto-erotic purposes.Last year a man perforated his bowel after he lost control of a 30in bendy sex toy after a boozy night.The 53-year-old man presented to A\u0026ampE complained of severe lower abdomen pain and admitted he had inserted a non-battery operated sex toy into his rectum.Doctors noted that the sex toy had been inserted into the rectum when the man was under heavy alcohol influence which led to a loss of control."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409368888.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"facebook marketplace man takes ford fiesta without paying","story":"George Wood, 21, had advertised his silver Ford Fiesta on Facebook Marketplace when he handed over the keys to a “toothless” man - who promised to pay for it later.But George was left around £300 out of pocket when the buyer failed to transfer the money into his bank account.When the money failed to materialise he sent a flurry of texts to the culprit who responded: “You won’t be getting your money but you will be getting a punch in the mouth”.After Kent Police said there was nothing he could do, because he had willingly handed over the keys, George from Ashford, Kent posted an appeal on Facebook to try to find his motor.The alleged thief then sent George a picture of his 16-year-old car at a scrap yard - being crushed by a giant metal claw.George said: I was a bit of an idiot.

at speeds of 150mph without having to build new routes.The report also says there should be high-speed trains running to Cambridge, Norwich, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Exeter and Swansea.And it suggests plugging in major airports to the high-speed network - meaning it would take just 15 minutes to reach Stansted from Central London, while Heathrow would gain direct links to a number of major cities.In the North, cities including Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Newcastle and Hull would be linked in a Northern Powerhouse Rail system which would help the region challenge London.Greengauge 21 claims the plan - which would cost billions of pounds - would allow Britains productivity to soar, giving a huge boost to the economy.Director Jim Steer said: Britain lacks a long-term national railway strategy beyond HS2.We need a plan to put rocket fuel into our economic productivity and todays report sets out proposals to do so.It is vital for the future of the country that no region is left behind, and the national railway strategy needs to reach all parts of the country.A Government spokesman said: This Government has an ambitious and clear strategy for the future of our rail network.Whilst we may not agree with all recommendations in this report, it is an important contribution to the debate and underlines the need for HS2, delivering the rail network this country needs for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"vulnerable 100 year old woman left with broken neck after nasty street mugging for handbag","story":"The OAP suffered serious injuries after the

plans","story":"Jacob Rees Mogg hit out after bungling civil servants admitted preparations for what would happen if talks collapsed has been “virtually non-existent” in Whitehall.Smug mandarins have boasted that the Prime Minister will not be able to walk away from the Brexit negotiating table as the country is not ready a “cliff-edge” exit.Despite deadlock between warring Cabinet factions, and talks with Brussels at a near standstill, Whitehall chiefs believe Britain will have to be forced to suck up a bad deal.One told the Financial Times: “Our ability to deliver a ‘no deal’ outcome recedes with every week that passes.”But the gleeful public concession has infuriated senior Tories, who say Whitehall feet-dragging has hurt Britain’s hand in the tense talks with the EU.The Foreign Secretary - who has just returned from a trip to South America - said quitting the EU will allow us to build stronger links with other countries.And he said our EU membership had weakened ties with countries such as Argentina, Chile and Peru.Boris wrote in the Daily : Now is our moment not to be less European - we can do a great free trade deal with the EU that will benefit both sides - but to be truly global again.Now is the time to create deals with these dynamic countries.He added: For Latin America and for Britain there are realms of gold on either side of the Atlantic. All we need now is to rediscover that global spirit.Mr Rees Mogg, who heads up a powerful bloc of Brexiteers, hit out: “Planning for no deal ought to be an essential part of the negotiations strategy.“To show we could easily walk away would worry the EU, strengthening our position and failing to do so would be both incompetent and weak.”And another Tory MP who serves as a government aide said they had been left “deeply unimpressed” by the attitude of the civil service.Last year Philip Hammond announced £3 billion of funds in his Autumn Budget to prepare for “every possible outcome” of Brexit.But critics say half of this cash will not be available until next 2019 - when Britain is due to leave.It comes as a fresh rift between Mr Hammond and the Bank of England opened over how close Britain stays to Brussels after Brexit.Insiders say relations between the Treasury and Old Lady of Threadneedle Street are “very, very bad”.The chancellor is reported to want to keep the City tied as closely as possible to the European rulebook, while the Bank fear the UK will simply become a “rule taker.”That makes for a very strong hand.The EU would have a huge hole in its budget without our cash, and the Continent’s businesses will be livid if trading with the world’s sixth largest economy becomes more difficult.Yet if EU negotiators don’t take us seriously because we haven’t got regulators and standards bodies on standby if we do decide to go it alone, Brussels will serve us up nothing but thin gruel.And we’ll have no choice but to meekly surrender.The Prime Minister must ensure that Whitehall is prepared for Britain to go it alone. That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail. They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Time for more elections and bigger votes.“If Italy gets another pro-EU appointee as Prime Minister expect real anger.”And Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun the situation “tells you all you need to know about the European elites suspicion of democracy and desire to thwart voters who have been impoverished by the ideology of the EU.”Director of the Open Europe think tank Henry Newman said the country was now “rapidly descending into political chaos”.He warned: “Rather than respecting the democratic mandate of the League and Five Star Movement, the president is in danger of being seen to frustrate it.“The road ahead may be very busy for Italy but also for Europe as a whole. Rather than hearing the alarm bell and changing tack, all Europe’s political elites seem to be able to do is plough straight ahead even faster.”GOT a story?

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake.

But 60 years on those once-young men who were ordered to watch the test firing of Britain\u0027s deadliest weapon are victims of a different horror: official denial. At war pension hearings, Supreme Court appeals and over petitions and pleas, successive British governments have told our nuclear test veterans that what they did was nothing special. They were not irradiated, they cannot prove it, they have no claim.  There is evidence aplenty of what happened to those men. A University of Dundee study found a third of the veterans died before 1999, most in their 50s and from the sort of cancers that, were they at an American bomb test, would have got them a war pension.    To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .    Their wives report 3 times the normal rate of miscarriages. Their children have 10 times the normal amount of birth defects - such as missing and extra teeth, spine and skull deformities, heart and eye problems. Another study found double the rate of blood cancers that the government had admitted another found higher rates of leukaemia, Down\u0027s syndrome and infant mortality.  And we know the Grapple Y blast alone, on April 28, 1958, was 100 times more powerful than the bombs which levelled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Imagine how it feels to be that veteran, and told that your family\u0027s suffering is still not proof.  The British government has always insisted on a scientific link between the radiation and the veterans\u0027 claimed health issues. That sounds reasonable, until you realise that the science which could establish the truth simply hasn\u0027t been invented yet - and by the time that it is, the veterans will all be long gone.  Of the 22,000 who were sent to Maralinga in Australia, Malden Island and Christmas Island in the south Pacific, and to US tests in Nevada, just 1,500 are still alive. A small and shrinking cohort who are still fighting a long-forgotten war.  But they have 155,000 descendants. You might even be one without knowing it, if there are estrangements or remarriages within your family. And scientists do agree on something - that radiation causes genetic mutation, that these mutations can last for 20 generations or 500 years, and that there is no way of knowing who will be affected.   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   Radiation causes random changes in the DNA. It may be pancreatic cancer, a thyroid dysfunction, or your sperm is rendered useless. It could be your children have blue eyes rather than green. A 2007 study on New Zealand veterans at British bomb tests found they had the same rate of genetic damage as survivors of the Chernobyl blast. The UK government would have you believe this is coincidence.  We need only common sense to realise that what links these men and their families to those of Chernobyl is the release of deadly, damaging material. Perhaps they were not all irradiated - perhaps they were harmed by the DDT sprayed over the island most days, or the toxic heavy metals that rain out of nuclear explosions like beryllium, or something else that was unique to the nuclear tests we conducted on two Pacific islands and two separate continents. The British government claims the bombs were safe. If that was so, why did we build a massive military base in the middle of the South Pacific in order to explode them?   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .   If that was so, why didn\u0027t we save a lot of time and expense and test those bombs in Southampton? And if that was so, of what use could non-harmful, totally safe bombs possibly be to our military?  The answer, of course, is that it wasn\u0027t safe. We wouldn\u0027t do it today. And if we ever were to fire another nuclear weapon, you can be damned sure that we wouldn\u0027t do it with 22,000 of our own servicemen stood underneath it dressed in nothing but cotton shorts.   They did not know the risks. Many were on National Service with no choice about being there. The risks they took are now perfectly clear.  On Christmas Island a few weeks ago four of the veterans returned to dedicate a new memorial built by the impoverished islanders. They were feted by local politicians, given all respect, and invited to parade the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans\u0027 Association.  That is more honour than they have ever received in their own country. Here, they are told to apply for a war pension, and that to get one they\u0027ll need proof of their radiation dose, when such proof is either held by the government, never existed, or has long since been lost. So 90% of all their pension applications are rejected.  Here, \u0026pound17m of taxpayer\u0027s money has been spent fighting court claims for compensation. Here, the government admits irradiating civilians but not service personnel. Here, if they want a medal they have to buy an unofficial, unrecognised one - and it\u0027s \u0026pound45.

Madeline Dye has never been on a date and her first - and only - visit to a pub came on her 90th birthday. But she reckons her extraordinary longevity is down to avoiding the stresses that come with marriage and relationships.  Madeline was born in Heeley, South Yorkshire, in 1912 - the same year the Titanic sank and the Woolwich foot tunnel opened.  The retired bookbinder lived independently at home until the age of 103 when a fall left her needing nursing care. At home, she cooked steak and chips in dipping and kept herself busy around the house - even putting up her own curtains in her later years.  Despite moving to Norton Lees Hall care home, Madeline still walks without a stick and can often be found chatting with other residents. She celebrated her 106th birthday on April 28 with a family trip to Baslow, Derbyshire and a party at the care home. Her niece Diana Heaton, 80, said: She walks freely without a stick and is very independent. When she was 103 she asked if I could change some curtains for her in a bedroom. I said I would do it the next day and when I arrived she said \u0027do you like the curtains - look what I\u0027ve done?\u0027 She changed them and carried some steps from the cellar up the stairs to her front bedroom. She does still dress herself and goes into the common room and chats with people. She has a great sense of humour still, she has never lost it. Whenever anyone asks her about her past romances or if she has a husband, she says \u0027I\u0027ve never had one, that\u0027s why I\u0027m this age\u0027. She says she has not had the stresses of marriage, it\u0027s tongue-in-cheek more than anything. She has always loved her clothes and has always dressed immaculately.

But one joke which failed to go unnoticed was a dig at Manchester’s two football teams, Manchester Evening News reports .

Andy and Abi Middleham emptied their savings account to buy a used \u0026pound7,700 Ford Focus 1.0-litre Ecoboost, which they planned to keep for years. In November the car\u0027s manufacturer recalled the six-year-old car as part of a nationwide review to replace a degas hose pipe from the coolant reservoir to the engine.  The car was returned but just three months later there appeared to be engine problems as black smoke began pouring from the exhaust, the Nottingham Post reports.  And the couple say this is when their nightmare really began.  Mr Middleham, a structural engineer from Gedling, booked the troubled motor into his local garage and the diagnosis was the replacement pipe had come loose and the engine had overheated. The garage wrote a letter to the Ford dealership, saying the recall work was not done properly, said Mr Middleham. But they didn\u0027t agree and offered only a 55% contribution, which left us with over \u0026pound2,300 to pay for their mistake. Their only response being that they are not obligated to make any kind of contribution as the vehicle is out of warranty. The distressed couple now have strong backing from their MP Vernon Coaker. The politician vowed: I am contacting Ford again to say this is totally unacceptable. My constituent is faced with a huge bill because of a design fault which Ford know about. There can be no ifs or buts about this – it should just be put right and customers should be reimbursed in full. People who buy their cars in good faith, and put their trust in the major manufacturers like Ford deserve better. Ford needs to change its policy now.  But Ford insists it has worked hard to keep customers informed and has a fast-track process to assess each case. A statement said contribution is on the basis of vehicle usage and service history, which can be the reason why there is not a consistent level of identical Ford support in every case. The full statement reads: In March 2015 Ford Focus 1.0-litre petrol owners were notified of a service action caused by the coolant hose potentially failing at high temperatures on cars built between October 2011 and October 2013. As a result of the service action, 86 per cent of affected vehicles have been reworked. Owners not covered by this notification experiencing a problem should visit a Ford dealer. If the cause is the same, Ford will contribute to costs on the basis of normal vehicle use, service record and any repair being carried out by Ford. But father-of-two Mr Middleham is unhappy with Ford\u0027s response, saying: Our vehicle was recalled as Ford have stated. The recall works were completed in November 2017 at their Sandicliffe Dealership. The engine still failed in February 2018 despite of this. Our car was at Sandicliffe Ford for nine weeks (the repair took seven weeks) and we were refused a courtesy car for the duration of that time. The couple have sought solace on a Facebook group, where other owners of the Ford Focus Ecoboost complain about not being fully compensated. Mr Middleham says there are almost 600 cars listed on the group page allegedly with similar problems. He feels his case is a particular injustice as the problem with his car was not of his making or wear and tear. The car was owned by the family for two years and had a full service history, said Mr Middleham.

Biking around with those massive backpacks looks like pretty hard work. But what do the riders themselves think about their job?  Cambridge News has spoken to a number of drivers in the city, after the food delivery company reported order grew by a massive 147 per cent in last year,  Here\u0027s the top 10 things the anonymous bikers want to say about their profession. 1. There\u0027s no better way to exercise for the cyclists If you\u0027re looking to get paid for a workout, and you\u0027re not a fan of the gym or exercising regularly - then there\u0027s not a better way to get fit. The mission to deliver someone\u0027s food takes over you, and before you know it, you\u0027ll have legs the size and power of nuclear bombs and a lung capacity of a whale. That\u0027s probably why there\u0027s so many of us. 2. A tip can go a long way Some of us are Deliveroo riders to earn extra cash in our spare time because, let\u0027s be honest, Cambridge is one of the most expensive places to live on planet Earth. When we travel across the city (especially in shocking conditions when we\u0027re most needed), we arrive to your plush home, be extra nice to you and leave you feeling nice and warm inside, and discover that we\u0027ve not been given a tip - it\u0027s soul-destroying. You can obviously choose to give a tip before we\u0027ve even arrived, so there\u0027s no guarantee you\u0027ll get perfect service. But it does go a long way. 3. Be more specific about your address This is mostly for people living in flats and student halls. The number of times when we\u0027ve not been able to get hold of you, not knowing which flat or halls of residence you\u0027re in, and as a consequence been stranded for ages while we lose time to deliver more orders to extend our time in this city, is enough to drive you mad. Please put your address in specifically. We don\u0027t get paid by the hour, we get paid per order.  4. I\u0027m not late, I\u0027ve only got around 10 deliveries to do before you Look mate, I\u0027m not late because I couldn\u0027t find your home, or that I\u0027m walking at a leisurely pace just because I want to annoy you. Sometimes we\u0027re given several orders to deliver at once, so you might be the last one. If we could get more orders done within the hour, we would absolutely try - that\u0027s more money for us, and quicker food for you. Everyone would be a winner. 5. We\u0027re not peasants This counts for a small minority of people, but you do sometimes get spoken to with a patronising and demanding tone, like because we\u0027re a service that you\u0027ve paid for - we somehow deserve to be treated like we\u0027re the brunt of society. When we\u0027re not able to find your flat, for example, please assume it\u0027s because you\u0027ve not been specific about where you live, rather than assume because we deliver food we\u0027re not educated enough to navigate Google Maps. It\u0027s not like we use it for our entire shift, or anything. And another thing, some of us have other jobs. So we might be more educated than you.  6. We\u0027ve judged you slightly if you live next to the restaurant I don\u0027t buy the cynicism about Deliveroo users. Some think it\u0027s for lazy people. The reality is there will be times when you really can\u0027t cook and/or travel for ingredients or meals. It\u0027s a great solution to that. But then there are times when you\u0027re totally miffed. I received an order from someone who wanted a Nando\u0027s recently, and arrived outside their home to find that it was directly across the road to it. You\u0027ve been totally judged, mate. 7. Getting an order for us is sometimes like the holy grail The Deliveroo rider app works according to supply and demand. We wait in a location to be notified that an order is ready for us. We choose to accept or reject it. In busy periods (which tend to be cold evenings), we\u0027re sorted. We\u0027ll get so many orders, and will work as long as we can to try and fit in at least three orders per hour. But when it\u0027s warm and every Deliveroo cyclist is out - we\u0027ll all be thirsty for orders. So when we arrive to your location and we\u0027re super happy, it\u0027s because you\u0027ve quenched us.

But it seems that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have been making plans for a romantic break in one of the most spectacular places on Earth. The newly-wed pair are believed to be headed for the Canadian Rockies, specifically Jasper National Park in the heart of the province of Alberta. According to TMZ, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be staying in a secluded log cabin at Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, a sprawling resort set in pristine wilderness.  Their home-from-home will be the 6,000sqft Outlook Cabin dubbed The Royal Retreat as it has hosted a number of other royal guests including the current Queen and Prince Philip in 2005 and her parents in 1939.  Jasper Park Lodge is set on the shores of Lac Beauvert and has a vast golf course which has been rated the best in Canada. The couple are likely to be protected by Canadian and British security. Sources told TMZ that the 700-acre resort had ordered in specialist gear it normally does not keep on site.  Jasper is a UNESCO World Heritage site reknown for its abundant wildlife including grizzly, black bears, mountain caribou, elk, moose and wolves.   Details emerged about their honeymoon after more information came out about Prince William\u0027s speech. One of the guests told the Sunday Times the second in line to the throne made a filthy joke about wet knickers. Unfortunately details of the joke haven\u0027t been leaked - but we really hope we find out at some point! William also pulled a prank on his little brother at the party, and nearly floored some of the guests in the process.  Apparently Harry recently fell off a ladder while trying to change a lightbulb, so Wills tied a ladder to the back of the newlyweds\u0027 car. Harry\u0027s pal Charlie van Straubenzee also spoke, mocking the prince for his ginger hair. According to the Times, he questioned Harry\u0027s behaviour when he was acting as dorm monitor at Ludgrove School in Berkshire, where they were both students. He said: All I wanted was a cuddle from my mummy. Instead Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out on to the roof. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined?  The bride and groom also made speeches during the evening reception at Frogmore House in Windsor Castle. Harry reportedly moved guests to tears as he gushed over his new wife and paid tribute to her mum Doria. Meghan read an emotional love poem and declared she had finally found her prince.

Social media star Kate Ovens, famed for her insatiable appetite, put away the more than four-and-a-half pound giant steak that she said was the same size as her face. Kate, 24, destroyed the giant bone-in ribeye steak with glee - despite it being large enough to feed a family of six. The petite food blogger said: It was literally the same size as my face. This was the biggest steak I had ever seen.  I honestly thought I\u0027d have had no chance finishing it. When I picked it up on the board, it was about the same weight as a brick. But once I took the first bite, my fears went away - it was so juicy and tender. Before the challenge, I had been worried that I would get bored of the taste, so I asked for lots of different sauces. The flavour of the beef was so exquisite that it didn\u0027t need anything at all.  If I\u0027m being honest with myself, I was a bit disappointed when it was over. I\u0027d gladly do it again. The steak weighed more than 2.2kg, which is more than half the weight of a standard house brick - or the equivalent to a medium pumpkin. Kate is no stranger to big portions, but what made this eating feat even more impressive is that it was the first time she had ever taken on a steak challenge. She said: Up until quite recently, I was really not that bothered about steak - but I\u0027m definitely a big fan now  The 5ft 5ins blogger polished off the biggest steak served at M restaurant in Bank, central London, a bone-in ribeye more than four inches thick. She was asked to try to eat huge hunk of beef, which sells for a whopping \u0026pound240, to celebrate the eatery\u0027s chef\u0027s table at Chestertons Polo in the Park next month. Kate, who lives in Kennington, south London, said: I guess they got me involved because I can eat like a horse. I\u0027m not complaining through, it was an absolute pleasure from start to finish. Chestertons Polo in the Park asked me to eat the steak because I\u0027ve got a reputation for being as hungry as a horse - and it\u0027s true.

Samantha Markle, who shares a father with the newlywed 36-year-old, has been scathing of her estranged relative on social media and in the press. In her most recent outburst she has slammed the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s coat of arms and said it “looks like it was drawn by someone in a kindergarten classroom”. Samantha Markle, who has not spoken to Meghan since 2015, said the design of the arms was “silly” because neither the UN, women’s rights nor “anything of substance” is represented.  Kensington Palace said on Friday when the image was released that Meghan had worked closely with the College of Arms throughout the design process. Ms Markle said: “Quills for communication? “She does not communicate with people she cuts people out of her life including a best friend of 30 years and two speeches in her whole life time does not make her a public speaker. “Her degrees are in drama and foreign affairs and only a bachelor degree.” She went on: “Her motto is say nothing and she cut everyone off.” “It just seems like the coat of arms was thrown together he’s [sic] silly because neither the UN, nor women’s rights, nor anything of substance.. but especially our dad and even her mom are not represented there.  It is an empty coat of arms so it makes no sense.”  She added: “Our father should be named on the coat of arms and for the Royals to deprive him of that is classless.” Earlier, she had written: “Extremely improper that my father was not named on the coat of arms and quite frankly looks like it was drawn by someone in a kindergarten classroom.” Thomas Markle Snr, 73, is not being granted a coat of arms in a break with royal family tradition. The Duchess of Sussex worked closely with the royal College of Arms throughout the design process, with each aspect of the image holding personal meaning for her. The blue background of the shield represents the Pacific Ocean off the California coast, while the two golden rays across the shield are symbolic of the sunshine of The Duchess\u0027s home state. The three quills represent communication and the power of words.

Caroline Sutton, 38, spent three weeks in an induced coma after a clot caused damage to around a quarter of her brain on the left side. Now, she is only able to say four, four, four over and over again. The former mental health nurse, from Atherton, Greater Manchester, underwent the operation to treat a brain aneurysm in February.  The procedure, known as an endovascular aneurysm coiling procedure, carries just a 2% risk of complication, the Manchester Evening News reports.  Caroline, who has two young sons, George and Max, had undergone the same successful procedure, to treat a different artery, 10 years earlier.  She was reportedly told by doctors at The Walton Centre in Liverpool that she should be home a couple of days after the surgery. However, a clot formed during the treatment, damaging part of her brain. The severe swelling was crushing her brain, meaning surgeons needed to perform a craniectomy, to remove a quarter of her skull to prevent further damage. The effect was catastrophic. Caroline’s husband, Chris, was warned by doctors his wife may die. There is no suggestion medics were at fault. Caroline was just tragically unlucky. “I will never forget what the surgeon said to me at the time,” Chris said. “He said it was very difficult to be optimistic about Caroline’s recovery and that the next 72 hours would be critical.  “I remember going home to tell the kids. It was one of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had to have. “My eldest asked me if his mum was going to die and I had to say I didn’t know. It’s been very difficult.” Caroline was in an induced coma for three weeks, had two bouts of pneumonia, and experienced delirium following her surgery. But the mum, originally from Warrington, did manage to survive and is now in the process of rehabilitation at Trafford General Hospital. As well as severe mobility and cognitive problems, she requires daily speech and language therapy, and is currently only able to repeat the word ‘four’. Caroline’s friends and family are now fighting for the intense level of daily therapy they say she needs if she is going speak coherently again. Her loved ones have reportedly been told she will need at least two years of inpatient rehabilitation.  Like many services, funding for speech and language therapy has been slashed in recent years, meaning Caroline is only getting two therapy sessions a week in hospital. It is against NHS rules for patients to be treated by a private therapist as an NHS patient. “It does feel like a daily battle to get the therapy Caroline needs,” said Chris, who has enlisted the help of his local MPs to help with his cause. “There are no guarantees about her recovery. We’ve been told because Caroline is young that is a positive, but no one has a crystal ball. “What we do know is, therapy at this stage is vital for Caroline. At the moment she is communicating through gestures and drawing pictures. “That’s okay for now but not practical if she going to regain her independence.” Despite the difficulties the family has faced, Chris says his wife has shown her typical ‘grace and humour’ throughout her treatment. “She’s still there,” he said.

Denise Ward, 56, daughter of nuclear test veteran John, 81, said she cannot remember a time she wasn’t ill. As a child she had most of her teeth removed, leaving her with extensive jaw damage. As an adult she endured 14 years of fertility treatment, to no avail. And at 56, she has suffered double incontinence as her pancreas has stopped working properly. Denise said: “I’ve now got calcium growths on my shoulder that have had to be chipped off.” She has to take pig enzymes with every meal to help digestion and has been unable to work for a decade.  Denise added: “My parents are still having to take care of me. It’s not right. It’s taken a toll on my mental health.” Brother Mark, 54, had part of a kidney removed due to a cancerous tumour and dad John has had bladder cancer. In 1958 he was sent to Christmas Island in the South Pacific as a shorthand typist for an RAF air vice marshal. He witnessed six nuclear test blasts.

The bride and groom both spoke, as well as Prince Charles and Prince William. But there was another speech from Harry\u0027s oldest pal Charlie van Straubenzee, which included a moving tribute to how the young royal dealt with his mother\u0027s death. The men have known each other since prep school, the private education equivalent to primary school, and Charlie said he was very proud of the way his friend handled the tragedy aged just 12 years old.   A guest told the Sunday Times : He described how awful it had been for Harry to go through everything and how proud all Harry’s friends are of how he has come through it.  He told Harry how happy his mother would have been that he has found love with Meghan and how excited she would be to see them starting their lives together as a married couple. Harry was pretty emotional at that point. The guest said he also praised Meghan for making Harry so happy since they started dating.  But he wasn\u0027t so kind to his pal in the rest of the speech, and he teased him for his ginger hair. He also questioned Harry\u0027s behaviour when he was dormitory monitor when they were at Ludgrove School in Berkshire, accusing him of throwing his teddy bear on the roof.   Best man Prince William also teased his little brother during his speech and also told a filthy joke about wet knickers .   Harry\u0027s speech reportedly moved guests to tears , gushing over his wife and paying tribute to her mum Doria.

The Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte looked relaxed as they spent the day at Houghton Horse Trials in Norfolk. The laid-back family outing couldn\u0027t be more different to last weekend, when they took centre stage at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s royal wedding. Princess Charlotte looked adorable in a red summer dress with pink trainers and seemed to be enjoying a tasty ice cream cone.  Mum Kate, dressed in a pretty blue \u0026pound39.99 dress from high street favourite Zara, was spotted bending down to help the children with something. Prince George also had the chance to have a look inside a fire truck during their day out. The young prince is known for his love of emergency vehicles, and last Christmas the only item on his list to Santa was a police car.  It doesn\u0027t look like Prince William and baby Louis joined the rest of the family for the summer day out. The family are regulars at the annual event, which is held in the grounds of Houghton Hall. At the 2016 event the family were seen enjoying a family picnic and Kate was photographed wiping George\u0027s face in an adorable \u0027normal family\u0027 moment. The Cambridges have a family home in Norfolk where they lived when Prince William was working as a pilot for the East Anglian Air Ambulance.  Princess Charlotte, who turned three last month, stole the show at her Uncle Harry\u0027s wedding last weekend with her confident royal wave on the steps of Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel. Her big brother on the other hand seemed rather shy, holding his dad\u0027s hand and hiding behind his leg.

Jess Coleman was left with a gaping wound in her forehead after getting caught in the crossfire in a bar brawl, reports the Huddersfield Examiner .  She had only been in Five Bar, in Huddersfield town centre, for 20 minutes when a man walked in off the street and attacked a man who was with two women nearby. He then lifted a glass from an overhead rack at the bar and launched it across the room, but it missed his intended victim - and hit Jess in the face. She said: “One of the women threw a drink and it splashed me so I grabbed a napkin from the bar and looked down to clean it off my arm.  “Then I could tell a glass hit my head. I think I was just in his path. “I looked down again and saw the blood pouring down. I couldn’t see out my left eye because there was so much blood. “I fainted. I think it was from the shock. “The bouncer picked me up and took me upstairs to a first aider.” Jess, who is from Liversedge, had travelled into town with two of her friends and went to the Slug and Lettuce and Revolution first. She said she had little to drink and is lucky she has a good memory of the incident. A spokesperson for Five Bar said: “We have done everything right that we could have done and we’re devastated, but it’s just the nature of the beast. “The incident was captured on five HD cameras and we’ve handed all the CCTV to the police.” West Yorkshire Police confirmed there is an ongoing investigation, but were unable to provide further details.  The Mirfield Free Grammar student, who is in the middle of doing her A Level exams, said: “If I hadn\u0027t looked down at my arm to dry it off, it could have been my eye or the back of my head [that was hit] and it could have killed me.” A bouncer rushed her upstairs where she received first aid and emergency services were called, but the ambulances were too busy and her parents had to come to the bar and take her to hospital, where the cut was glued. Jess, who is due to start studying an events management degree at Leeds Beckett University in September, said: I think the bar staff should have [tackled the fight] sooner when it was getting rowdy, but I think they handled the situation with me well. “The bouncer should have taken him outside, rather than further in towards the bar which was nearer the glasses.” The culprit was described as black, around six feet tall and wearing a white shirt.  Jess’s sister Becky posted an appeal to identify him on Facebook and it was shared more than 800 times.  Jess said: “It’s not what I wanted when I’d just turned 18 and has knocked my confidence a bit. "},{"url":null,"title":"what jamie oliver say mum","story":"NewsWhat will Jamie Oliver say?

At Makcari\u0027s in Herne Bay, the condiment otherwise reserved for fried potatoes and other savoury dishes has been turned into pudding. Maker Nejmi Hassan is all for unlikely concoctions when crafting his ice cream. At the parlour, which has been going since 1931, you\u0027ll also find an ice cream flavoured with mushy peas, and another with Marmite. The latter, we can only assume, is a love or hate type of affair.  Nejmi hopes his odd twists prove the taste of the summer. But he concedes too that the flavours are also for acquired tastes. After all, he\u0027s mixing peas with double cream and Marmite with milky sweetness. Nejmi churns ketchup into his red sauce blend and serves it with a sachet of Heinz – as if in a train station cafe or a fish and chip shop. His mushy peas ice cream comes with a green swirl running throughout, and his Marmite cones are served with a slice of toast.

Cow\u0027s milk remains by far the biggest in the business. More than 750 million tonnes is produced and consumed every year. But as the global population grows and sustainability increasingly questioned, some are looking elsewhere for traditional food sources. After all, cows – all 1.5 billion of them – are the most damaging thing on the planet right now. More than cars, planes or nuclear testing.  All the other milks require farming. Goat\u0027s milk is obvious, but other sources, such as coconuts and rice, have an effect on the environment. Producing enough is hugely expensive and takes its toil on the land required for cultivation. Which is why people are milking cockroaches. They\u0027re cheap, rice in nutrition, and take up hardly any room. Some people are really drinking cockroach milk as a dairy alternative now. The milk is derived from \u0027cockroach crystals\u0027, a part of the insect found in its gut. According to scientists, these crystals are \u0027like a complete food\u0027, rich in essential amino acids and protein. A researcher from the Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine in India claims the nutritional value of the cockroach product is much higher than other milks. What\u0027s more, apparently it tastes no different from cow\u0027s milk.  Milk sourced from Australian Pacific cockroaches is said to contain dietary sequences with all the essential amino acids, proteins, fats and sugars, and three times the energy of regular dairy milk. Some cockroaches lay eggs, but there is one species, called Diploptera Punctata, which gives birth to young and feeds them with milk. Diploptera Punctata is the only species of roach that gives birth to living offspring, as opposed to laying eggs, and produces milk to feed their young. South African company Gourmet Grubb is already farming cockroaches and producing milk fromthe bugs. The product is called \u0027Entomilk\u0027 and is created from sustainably farmed cockroaches. One of the most pivotal benefits of Entomilk is that it has a high protein content and is rich in mineral such as iron, zinc, and calcium, the brand says. But it\u0027s hard work. Being insects, it takes as many as 1,000 cockroaches to make just 100grams of milk, according to science website Inverse. And it\u0027s not just a case of attaching a machine to udders and massaging the teats.

She was just 45 when she died but she always held everything together.“She doesn’t have a headstone – the tree is effectively that – but when I go to that space I feel the presence of my mum.“It’s not a sad feeling.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

manager said: “I think because we tried to get him last summer helped.“We wanted to sign him then but with Ayr United going full-time again he was keen to have another season of full-time football.“He also gets on well with Simon Ferry and Greg Fleming and they encouraged him to come.“Once again it wasn’t to do with me that he signed – it was to do with the reputation that Peterhead as a club have among players.“Paddy was delighted when we offered him a contract.”McInally also believes Boyle has plenty to contribute to Peterhead’s team. He added: “Paddy has really good experience and he is a really good player.“He’s a good defender, he’s a good talker which is important and he steps into the game really well from the left-back position.“We’re really pleased with how Aidan McIlduff performed at left-back for us this season.“But we’re still in the dark as to what Aidan will be doing next season.“So when Paddy became available it was a no-brainer to sign him.“Paddy was disappointed he was released at the end of the season by Ayr United.“Up until the last few games of the season he was playing and I think he was a bit disappointed.”Boyle has had a long career. He started out in the youth ranks at Everton. He didn’t play for the Toffees first team but did have loan spells at Norwich City and Crewe Alexandra before returning to Scotland in 2009 with Dumbarton.In the summer of 2009 he joined Partick Thistle, and during his spell at Firhill, Boyle had a loan stint at Clyde and then joined Dunfermline in 2011.Spells with Gateshead and Airdrieonians followed before he joined Ayr in 2015.McInally added: “We’ve got an experienced core of players with Paddy, Simon Ferry, Jamie Stevenson, Willie Gibson and Rory McAllister.“We could be looking at having an inexperienced central defence next season so it’s important to have experienced players such as Paddy as well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shire are shock troops while stoneywood dyce keep up their strong showing","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeenshire became the shock troops of the Eastern Premier after travelling to Edinburgh and handing Heriots their first defeat of the season.The win saw them moving smoothly into third position in the top Scottish league.Chris Venske, the Shire captain, was over the moon with his under-strength side’s all-round performance.He said: “We controlled the game from start to finish, this despite not having Ian Kirk and John Dickinson available, and then losing the toss on a very good track.“Our opening bowlers Callum Mackaness and Finlay Anderson did a great containment job before new boy Harry Doley stepped up to the mark, taking three for 38.“When we batted, half centuries from Craig Knight (53) and our professional Askhu Fernando (62) were the stand-outs, but it was Mackaness who saw us home with an unbeaten 37.’’Venske played his part at the tip of the innings with a solid 26, although his opening partner Kenny Reid collected a second consecutive first ball duck.Back in Aberdeen, Stoneywood-Dyce continued their relentless pursuit of the Strathmore Union title at Mannofield in a high-scoring game which saw 466 runs, 101 of which came from Liam Lindsay, the Peoples Park side’s overseas amateur.In the company of his captain Jack Mitchell (72), the stylish South African enjoyed an unbeaten partnership of 193 to take the visitors to 267 for the loss of two wickets from their allocation of 45 overs.When Mannofield batted, they slumped to 25 for three, but then Fraser Proud (67) came to the crease, helping to put on 155 for the fourth wicket, only to see the side collapse from 180 for three to 199 all out after the partnership was broken.Mitchell said: “This was a good, solid win. It was a perfect batting track.“Once you got your eye in, it was hard to get out.’’His opposite number Kieran Findlay was disappointed to lose but said: “We pushed them all the way, but while we are playing well we need to start winning.’’At Countesswells, Gordonians made it two league wins in a row, led superbly by skipper Aman Arora who hit a fine 60 in his side’s total of 229 for eight before restricting Perth Doocot to 151 for the loss of nine wickets.Arora said: “We are starting to find some good form after our poor start to the season.’’Aberdeen Grammar FPs and Bon Accord maintained their 100% records at the head of affairs in Aberdeenshire Grade 1.The highlight of Grammar’s 121-run win at the Peoples Park was a hat-trick of Stoneywood-Dyce batsmen by Roland Knudson, while the Bons were equally easy 115-run winners at the Links. Ahklaq Bashir scored 126 of his side’s 251.Crescent kept in touch with a five-wicket win at Cults.In Grade 2, leaders Gordonians were comfortable eight-wicket victors at home to Aberdeen Super Kings.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery granite city oilers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWe’ve taken a look back through our archives and found these images of the Granite City Oilers taken over the past few decades.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a winter in argyll part five","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/04/18, 3:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.At a talk in Lochgilphead Joint Campus, I heard John Aitchison talk about the Blue Planet, whilst reminding us all to rejoice in the bountiful wildlife right here in Argyll.And, of course, I wrote.Not only on my own, but at a night class at Argyll College, enthusiastically led by author Marian Pallister and encouraged by a host of talented classmates, most of whom will continue after Easter.I saw Local Hero in the MAYDS youth centre cosy sitting room and even made it to Screen Machine, securing the last seat for Murder on the Orient Express from someone who hadn’t managed to make it.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy. And we\u0026#8217ve got our two boys, so we\u0026#8217re quite occupied.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray progress in camanachd cup","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/05/18, 7:41 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Inveraray 2 Glasgow Mid Argyll 0Two early goals gave Inveraray a win over Glasgow Mid Argyll on a heavy Winterton pitch.Craig Taylor put Inveraray ahead on four minutes, with the ball taking a wicked bounce in front of the keeper.Lewis MacNicol doubled his side\u0026#8217s advantage on 15 minutes with a strike from the left which went across the keeper into the far corner of the net.Mid Argyll were struggling at the back but settled into the game and had a chance close to half-time to cut Inveraray’s lead when they were awarded a penalty.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Red Star won their only previous title \u0026#8211 SAFL Fourth Division \u0026#8211 in 1988 under manager Hughie Lindsay. There have been promotions, relegations and plenty of drama in between, but never a league crown.Red Star manager Dougie Moore said: \u0026#8216This is a major achievement for the club and for a small town like Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216We only have a small squad, but with some excellent players, many of whom have been involved with the Soccer Centre, which deserves great credit.\u0026#8216Seeing them play football with a smile and allowing them to express themselves on the pitch has been extremely pleasing and a personal highlight.\u0026#8217Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang and lead drummer Graeme MacMillan, Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the British Pipe Band Championship at Grade 4B.Craig, now in his sixth season leading the band, was \u0026#8216absolutely delighted\u0026#8217 to clinch first place among 21 competing bands.He added: \u0026#8216The band had an average age of 18 on Saturday at Paisley with four players in their first competition, one still in primary school.\u0026#8216It has taken years of hard work and a lot of that can be credited to Rod Buchanan for chanter lessons and Donald MacLachlan, our drum tutor.\u0026#8216It is also a great result for Graeme MacMillan, who returned after a five-year absence from the pipe band circuit to win a major.\u0026#8217The band celebrated in style on their return from Paisley with an impromptu performance in Lochgilphead town centre to the delight of band parents and supporters.Before heading to Tarbert on Sunday May 27 to play at the Scottish Series sailing event, Mid Argyll Pipe Band will be at the Ropework in Lochgilphead the day before to help Red Star celebrate.Star will receive the Premier 2 trophy at 3.45pm on Saturday and it is an occasion not to be missed.PICS:Mid Argyll Pipe Band members celebrates after their championship success. no_a21MAPBchamps01Pipe Major Craig Lang clutches the British championship trophy. 06_a21PipeBand08Lochgilphead Red Star AFC, league champions. 06_a18RedStar_TeamPhoto_home01\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 21","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 27/05/18, 5:12 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Many thanks to Robert Wakeham, writing in last week’s Advertiser, for his questions regarding the nesting colony and status of common gulls within the former oil depot, currently the Mid Argyll hub and museum construction site.I am happy to address these questions.Historically, this species was first named in the 1700s and thought by many to come from their association with grazing or ‘common land’ and in the more recent past the name ‘uncommon gull’ may be more apt.In the UK they are essentially restricted as a breeding species to Scotland where numbers continue to decline, with this being reflected in Argyll, principally due to predation by the American mink, as pointed out.Studies at the Lingerton landfill site have shown that, unlike the larger gull species at the tip, Common Gulls do not scavenge there, as was perhaps claimed, but use the tidal mud flats of Loch Gilp and surrounding fields to find invertebrates, fish and vegetarian foodstuffs. As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Although the 29-goal striker didn’t play in their title-winning match against Albion, he played a huge part in Ayr finishing top. And before he had time to recover from Saturday’s celebrations, it was party time again as he was crowned PFA League One Player of the Year. The prolific hitman said: “Winning the league was brilliant, but the way we won it was special. “Winning player of the year put the icing on the cake. “It’s the first senior title I have won – I won under-20 titles but nothing like this.  “I have never even been nominated before for a player award, so it’s quite surreal. “It’s probably the best weekend in my career, and I will never forget it.” But despite celebrating the title and looking forward to life in the Championship, United fans are nervously waiting to hear if Shankland will commit his future to Ian McCall’s side. He said: “I don’t know what the future holds yet, mainly because we didn’t know what league we were going to be in. “We haven’t even spoke about it yet — we are still focused on the celebrations, to be honest.”  “The fans have been incredible all season and have always turned out in big numbers. “Especially away to Alloa, the turnout was just amazing. “The support have been amazing with me and have taken a real shine to me. “I have played well for Ayr and the fans have obviously recognised that, and it’s good to play for those fans. “This is my highest scoring season, but I was gutted not to get 30. “Although if I had a chance to get 30 it would have been in the play-offs, so I was happy to stay at 29.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision.

Chairman of the club Peter Mason said: “I am very proud that we now have over 100 members. “In the two years since the group started many things have happened, many new friendships have been formed and many new skills learned. “These groups are going from strength to strength, and I would like to thank the group leaders for all the hard work they put into their groups week on week and also to the members who come along to support each group.” The group meet on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, mostly at The Speakers, 8-10 Whitehall, on Maybole High Street.  From health and fitness classes like yoga and keep fit, sewing and a Knit and Natter class and even the opportunity to learn a new language with Spanish and German classes – there’s lots to do and new skills to achieve. Chairman Peter hopes more clubs can be formed to cater for even more members. He added: “For the future I hope to see some more new groups starting especially for male members as I am conscious that we do not have a lot to offer to them. “If we can retain our successes for another year, we will go from strength to strength and I hope each and every one of you will join me on that journey.” ● For more information of what activities are on offer, visit the website at www.mayboleover50s.org or contact club secretary Anne Walker on 07846 180753.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.
