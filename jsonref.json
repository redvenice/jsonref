I don\u0027t believe it\u0027s a picture of me in London because when I go out in London I wear a suit and a tie. \u0027That\u0027s what I would describe as my travelling clothes if I\u0027m going to go overseas. There’s plenty of photographs of me dressed in that sort of kit but not there.\u0027                 In a November TV interview, Andrew maintained that he does not recall meeting Giuffre US Attorney General William Barr has vowed to aggressively investigate and bring charges against anyone who may have helped Epstein, who killed himself in his jail cell last summer while he was awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The case brought renewed scrutiny to Epstein\u0027s many high-profile associates, including Andrew, who says he met the financier in 1999. The pair maintained their friendship even after Epstein served 13 months in a Florida county jail after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution in 2008. Andrew came under fire in 2010 after it was revealed that he stayed at Epstein\u0027s Manhattan home following his release from jail.     Asked during the November interview whether he regretted continuing his friendship with Epstein, Andrew said: \u0027Do I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes.\u0027 The BBC interviewer replied: \u0027Unbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u0027Andrew then apologized, saying: \u0027I\u0027m being polite, I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender. \u0027But no, was I right in having him as a friend? At the time, bearing in mind this was some years before he was accused of being a sex offender. \u0027I don\u0027t there was anything wrong then, the problem was the fact that once he had been convicted I stayed with him and that’s the bit that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u0027 Andrew was also friends with Maxwell, the British socialite accused in several civil lawsuits of recruiting girls and young women for Epstein to sexually abuse.Last week, a former police protection officer for Andrew came forward to claim that Maxwell would visit the prince at Buckingham Palace up to four times a day and that the pair would enjoy picnics together on the grounds of the estate in London. Met Police officer Paul Page, who worked for the Royals from 1998 to 2004, told The Mirror he first became aware of who Maxwell was in 2001 when the privy purse - the office that handles the Queen\u0027s private income - called to inform him that a guest was coming to see Andrew but that the name was not to be entered into the book. \u0027She turned up in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover and we let her in. Half an hour after that me and my colleague walked through the garden to go back to the police lodge and he was having a picnic with her by the summer house, opposite the Queen\u0027s ­bedroom window,\u0027 Page said.\u0027One of my colleagues saw her come in and out the Palace four times in one day.\u0027 Andrew claimed in the BBC interview that he last saw Maxwell in the early spring of last year, months before he was arrested on sex trafficking charges.  Maxwell has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein but is believed to be one of the key figures in the US government\u0027s probe. Two guards who were supposed to be monitoring Epstein the night he was found dead have already been charged with falsifying the jail\u0027s log books to indicate they were performing checks on prisoners, when they were actually sleeping or browsing the internet.  Prince Andrew \u0027had visits from Ghislaine Maxwell 4 times a day\u0027 says ex-protection officer - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Kobe Bryants former pilot claims Sikorsky S 76B reliable aircraft complex","story":"Share this articleKobe Bryant Helicopter Pilot Misjudged Terrain and Didn\u0027t Slow Down, Pilots SayKobe Bryant\u0027s helicopter was like a limousine and had a strong safety record, NBA star\u0027s former pilot says - Los Angeles Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Samantha Markle explains public fell sister Meghan","story":"Share this article \u0027Clearly there were some things that happened because the public\u0027s not stupid.\u0027They were witnessing some things that they didn\u0027t think were so cool and she didn\u0027t step up to the plate and fix them.\u0027That includes family, that includes public spending, there was a lot that happened that was attributable to behaviour.\u0027It wasn\u0027t about racism, it was about hey you guys aren\u0027t being cool step up to the plate and fix it.\u0027Samantha, who is twice orced and suffers multiple sclerosis, has been estranged from Meghan for more than a decade and was not invited to the royal wedding.          Samantha Markle, who shares Meghan\u0027s father Thomas (pictured), said it her behaviour that meant Meghan fell out of favour with the public Asked if there was any chance of her reuniting with her sister, she said: \u0027I didn\u0027t feel that\u0027s possible given that there was so much malice, there was so much attacking when it could have been nipped in the bud and we could be playing footsies under the table.\u0027She said she hopes Meghan and their father Thomas, 75, can reconcile before he dies.\u0027He was almost a single dad to her her whole life, gave her everything.

She said she spoke to Albert, who told her: \u0027You are not my daughter.\u0027         Delphine (pictured outside court in 2017) first          Delphine (left, with her mother in 2000) first claimed to be Albert\u0027s lovechild in 1999, after an unofficial biography of the Queen claimed he had an affair and a child born out of wedlock         Albert is thought to have started an affair with Baroness Longchamps in 1966 (pictured in 1965), before he became king but after he got marriedMs Boel claims that questions over her lineage led to her and her mother being put on a \u0027high risk\u0027 list by financial institutions, which led to Royal Bank of Scotland abruptly closing both of their bank accounts in 2012.She said her 11-year-old son was also put on the register, limiting his access to financial institutions.Ms Boel was told she would have to publicly denounce claims that Albert was her father in order to have their names removed.\u0027I refuse to sign such a lie,\u0027 she told German newspaper Die Welt. Those difficulties prompted her to go to the courts in 2013 in an attempt to prove her biological father was Albert.The same year the legal case began, Albert abdicated for \u0027health reasons\u0027, passing the throne to son Philippe - Ms Boel\u0027s half-brother. After several early setbacks, the breakthrough for Ms Boel came in November last year when a court ruled that Albert must provide a DNA sample for testing.Failure to comply would result in a €5,000 fine for each day the sample was missing.Albert is thought to have undergone the DNA test shortly afterwards, which proved he is Ms Boel\u0027s father.The royal then issued a statement on Monday confirming the paternity.          Six years ago, Ms Boel, who bears a striking resemblance to some members of the royal family, opened court proceedings to prove that Albert was her fatherLawyer Alain Berenboom then issued a statement which said: \u0027Even though there are legal arguments and objections that show that legal paternity is not necessarily a reflection of biological paternity and that the procedure followed can be disputed, King Albert has decided to put an end to this painful procedure in good conscience.\u0027Mr Yves-Henri Leleu, lawyer for Ms Boel, told MailOnline: ‘She feels good. She is very, very happy. A 20-year problem is at the point of being solved.‘Maybe she will have a party… Belgians are very big fans of champagne.’However, the lawyer says her joy at the outcome was tinged with sadness over her father’s reluctance to cooperate during her long paternity battle.‘If you carefully read the communiqué of the King you will find a lot of statements to show he is very reluctant,’ her lawyer said. ‘It is not an elegant communiqué. It is not very fair, very noble.’Ms Boël never believed she would be able to forge a relationship with King Albert, he added, and her legal action was intended purely to make peace with her heritage.‘It is not a question of having a father like when you are a little child,’ Mr Leleu said. ‘She does not have expectations about fatherhood in the strict meaning of the word.‘It is a question of personal identity, it is a question of genealogy, it is a question of public recognition.’Ms Boël, who has two children with Irish-American construction boss James O\u0027Hare.She has always insisted that, as a wealthy woman in her own right, her court action was not motivated by money but her desire for her children to know their grandfather.          Albert (right) has alluded to problems with his marriage to Paola, former Queen of Beligum, in the past but has refused to admit Ms Boel is his daughter until now         Ms Boel is pictured alongside her husband, American James O\u0027Hare, in Brussels in 2008.

Her technique was nice,\u0027 Banda Aceh Sharia police chief investigator Zakwan, who uses one name, told AFP.The controversial punishment enrages rights activists and generates heated media debate, as well as amongst politicians.Indonesia\u0027s president has issued a call for the public floggings to stop but he has little say over what happens in Aceh, a deeply conservative region on Sumatra island.         Unlike the rest of the nation, Aceh follows religious law as part of a 2005 autonomy deal agreed with the central government that ended a decades-long separatist insurgency.Here, public whipping remains a common punishment for scores of offenders for a range of charges including gambling, adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex.But the job has always been done by men. Until now.More and more women are being charged for morality crimes such as public affection or premarital sex, experts say, as greater internet access and globalisation bring clashes with local cultural and religious norms.Enforcement too has increased and now Aceh says it\u0027s trying to follow Islamic law, which calls for women to whip female perpetrators. This is already what happens in neighbouring Malaysia.But convincing women to participate has been no easy task, and it\u0027s taken years to assemble the first female squad, according to Safriadi, who heads provincial capital Banda Aceh\u0027s Sharia Implementation Unit.Eight women -- all Sharia officers -- agreed to be floggers and were trained in the appropriate technique and advised how to limit injury.Previously, a dozen men performed all the whippings in the city for an unspecified fee.For security reasons, Aceh officials declined to let AFP speak with the floggers, who are outfitted in cloth masks and loose fitting brown uniforms to hide their identities.We train them to make sure they\u0027re physically fit and teach them how to do a proper whipping, Zakwan said.But the secret for any whipping is getting past the mental hurdle of lashing fellow citizens.For that, you need to look to God, Zakwan said.It\u0027s kind of an indoctrination that we give to them so they have a better understanding of their role -- have no mercy for those who violate God\u0027s law\u0027, he added.- \u0027Too lenient\u0027 -Aceh officials insist caning deters crime, with patrols often scouring public places and establishments -- or acting on tip-offs -- to monitor behaviour.Sharia police in Banda Aceh, a city of some 220,000 people, are on the streets round-the-clock in three shifts.On a recent patrol, a couple sitting close to each other on the beach escaped with a reprimand.       Sharia police in Banda Aceh, a city of some 220,000 people, are on the streets round-the-clock in three shiftsBut a group of men and women spotted at a coffee shop around 3:00 am weren\u0027t so lucky and were arrested on suspicion of breaking strict codes about unmarried men and women interacting.This shows that we never sleep looking for violations of Sharia (Islamic law), Safriadi said.From behind bars, one of the men said that there was nothing romantic happening at the coffee shop.We don\u0027t even know the women and were sitting at different tables, he told AFP.The women were later released with a reprimand as were the men, but police said the trio may be charged for a new offence, after it was determined they were gay.Same-sex relations can earn residents a whipping in front of jeering crowds, which can number in the hundreds.Sharia in Aceh is still lenient, said resident Saiful Tengkuh.Aceh needs harsher punishments like stoning, not just whipping. Someone committing adultery should be stoned 100 times, he added.- \u0027Don\u0027t do it again\u0027 -Aceh, home to about 5 million people, once mulled beheading for serious crimes, but the central government ruled it out.This summer, it made headlines over a fatwa, or religious edict, against online game PlayerUnknown\u0027s Battlegrounds (PUBG) and opposing a national women\u0027s football league because it didn\u0027t have a stadium where only female players, match officials and spectators would be present.But whipping is often what gets Aceh in the news -- unwanted attention local officials say is Islamophobic.Advocates say many people caught breaking religious law choose whipping as an efficient, if painful, way to avoid a stiff jail term.But this rough justice can take a toll.Floggings can be so severe that people pass out or are hospitalised, with the most serious crimes -- including gay sex and having a relations with a minor -- earning as many as 150 lashes.Many offenders have fled the area out of shame or because customers deserted their businesses. Few are keen to discuss their experience.For women, arrest for even a minor violation can lead to victimisation, including sexual harassment and rape during arrest, according to research by the Network for Civil Society Concerned with Sharia.Reporting these assaults without proof can even open up victims to flogging for making a false accusation, it added.Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have condemned such punishments as barbaric, inhumane, and tantamount to torture.But Aceh officials insist they\u0027re far more lenient than ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia and some other Muslim nations.We\u0027re not aiming to hurt people by whipping them, Safriadi said.The most important thing is the shaming effect on violators and spectators so they don\u0027t do it again."},{"url":null,"title":"Washington Post reporters revolt decision suspend colleague Kobe Bryant tweet","story":"Share this articleKobe Bryant¿s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser¿s Story, and the Half-Confession"},{"url":null,"title":"Arts Council England rebrands artists creative practitioners","story":"Share this article Sarah Maxfield, area director for the North at ACE, said: \u0027The North has more places categorised as being \u0027low-engaged\u0027 with culture than any other area of the country.\u0027In that sense we see real opportunity in the ten-year strategy to build up the opportunities for those low-engaging communities to draw up the cultural experiences that they want to have.\u0027         Sarah Maxfield, area director for the North at ACE, said the project will particularly target the north of EnglandArt budgets in the North for 2018 to 2022 have increased by 20 per cent, with ACE targeting places outside of London for investment.Several projects only have modest grants and are community based.   One project in Millom, a small town in Cumbria, was made possible with a £15,000 grant and targeted all areas of the community, from schools to farmers. As part of the ten-year strategy for \u0027inclusive economic growth\u0027, there will also be more investment in libraries, as well as other more traditional places. Since 2010, public library funding has been cut by 25 per cent with almost 10 per cent closing.Artists rebranded as creative practitioners by Arts Council England | News | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Horrific moment woman fifties flung air like RAGDOLL","story":"Share this article The pedestrians appear to realise the car is about to hit them and they raise their hands in the air. It appears that the woman is sent flying over a spiked metal fence, into which the car crashes. One commenter, Brinsley Evans, said: \u0027Omg looks like school kids.

The win places cartoonist Jerry Craft alongside titans of American literature including Madeleine L’Engle, Louis Sachar and Beverly Cleary.Craft’s graphic novel New Kid follows the life of Jordan Banks, one of the only children of colour at a prestigious private school. Announcing Craft’s win, Newbery committee chair Krishna Grady called it a “distinct and timely story”. “Respectful of its child audience, it explores friendship, race, class and bullying in a fresh and often humorous manner … It is, simply put, a ‘distinguished contribution to American literature’,” said Grady, referring to the criteria of the prize, which is given by the Association for Library Service to Children. Established in 1922, the Newbery has gone to titles including L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time, Sachar’s Holes and Cleary’s Dear Mr Henshaw.Craft told School Library Journal that he hoped the win would help legitimise the graphic novel format – and show that stories featuring African American characters who “are not driven by misery” can also succeed.“There are very important books that talk about slavery and civil rights or police brutality or gang life, but I really wanted to add to their narrative by adding a boy who has a mom and a dad, a family who loves him, a support system, neighbours,” he said. “More than anything, I wanted to give 10-year-old Jerry Craft a book he could read and say was his own. That was probably the reason I was not a reader until I was an adult. The things I had to read in school couldn’t have been further from my life. Or if it was someone who looked like me, it couldn’t be further from the life I wanted to live when I got older.”Also announced on Monday was the winner of this year’s Caldecott Medal, which is awarded to the artist of “the most distinguished American picture book for children”.

The first question we should be asking is not how the BBC can be saved from its enemies on the right, but more constructively, what kind of public media organisation would best meet the technological and political challenges of the 21st century? Were we to build such an organisation from scratch, I don’t think it would look much like the BBC today.The BBC deserves credit for some of its successful online initiatives, but it remains a broadcasting organisation at a time when the future is very obviously digital. The television licence fee is symbolic of this. It is clear that this is unsustainable as a funding mechanism, which is why the BBC sought to close the so-called iPlayer loophole that allowed people without a TV to access BBC programmes online for free. This made sense financially but was a disastrous fudge strategically, reinforcing the notion that the licence fee is an annual payment for access to BBC programmes. This makes iPlayer look very much like Netflix, and audiences will quite reasonably ask whether they get equivalent value for money from each. But the BBC is not Netflix, and the argument for the licence fee should not be based solely on the distinctiveness of its programming. Rather it should be seen as a collective investment in universal technology, civic information, public services and shared culture.The original technological argument for public service broadcasting was based on what has been called spectrum scarcity. Since the “airwaves” were limited, this suggested that broadcasting was, if not a natural monopoly, then at least a natural oligopoly, where wavelengths should be allocated to a relatively small number of organisations. In advanced digital systems there are no such limits on the volume of content that can be distributed.Rightwingers, and the corporate interests they represent, are now seeking to leverage this technological potential for political purposes – just as they did with the arrival of cable. Then, as now, the argument is that since there is no technical limit on the number of producers the state should make way for market forces that can better respond to audiences.Their arguments have some force if one simply assumes that the market always delivers the best outcomes, but otherwise they start to fall apart. In fact there are very good arguments for public digital media. Commercial platforms have to monetise content by excluding non-consumers andor developing algorithms that surveil users to extract exploitable data and encourage addiction. Both are socially harmful and wasteful of programmers’ time and talents. Digital public media, by contrast, can be made universally available – which is a crucial civic principle of public media – and can be engaged with on a user’s own terms. We can potentially choose to be exposed to and support the production of content we value, rather than being constantly judged and incessantly nudged based on our online behaviours.This holds out the promise to reinvent the best of the Reithian cultural ethos in a way that is true to the principle of inidual freedom claimed by the proponents of market systems. John Reith envisaged a broadcaster that would deliver for audiences the best of culture and thought, a vision that relied on the BBC to judge what that was. Digital technology, however, allows us to make this judgment for ourselves. We may want to support certain types of programming we don’t readily consume, or to be exposed to content that challenges our perspectives or our tastes.These sorts of positive arguments for public digital media, though, will not come from the BBC or those close to it. The corporation has been thoroughly integrated into the market, and its senior executives are positively enthusiastic about this. The director general, Tony Hall, promised a competition revolution on his arrival, entrenching the marketisation of programme-making by further opening up the BBC to competition, and on announcing his early departure expressed satisfaction that he was leaving a BBC that was now “more commercially aware”. This is his legacy: the further embedding of commercial culture and the further erosion of the BBC’s political independence and capacity for impartial journalism.Politically there is widespread disenchantment with institutions, an anti-political mood, the impact of which has mostly been to empower nationalists and authoritarians. An organisation such as the BBC is particularly vulnerable in these circumstances. The background and wages of its executives and senior journalists, combined with the regulatory restrictions around accuracy and impartiality (which from the right look like bias), mean it is easily portrayed as part of a liberal metropolitan elite decried by reactionaries. It now faces a hostile Tory government with a majority not seen for a generation. The Conservatives had signalled their intentions towards the BBC even before Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street. In the wings there is Dominic Cummings, a truculent libertarian whose hostility to the BBC is informed by a longstanding conservative view of public service as nothing more than the ideology of self-serving bureaucrats undisciplined by the market.The BBC is not only an easy target ideologically but also a soft target politically. Champions of public service broadcasting have celebrated the principle of political independence, but even a cursory reading of the BBC’s history shows this is nothing but wishful thinking. The setting of the licence fee, the charter renewal process and governmental powers of appointment have routinely been used to reshape its culture. There have been a number of reports that Hall’s departure was a strategic move by the BBC to install the next director general before Johnson could appoint a new chair of the board to influence the appointment process, and Downing Street has angrily briefed that it will remove any director general not to its liking.This unabashed authoritarianism must be staunchly opposed. But the argument against governmental interference at the BBC has to be based on a convincing answer to the populist posturing of the Johnson government. What it wants is a public showdown with a stronghold of the liberal elite that will galvanise its base and deliver for the corporate interests it represents. The temptation will be to respond by championing independence as a liberal constitutional principle. This would be a major mistake. The classic patrician ethos may still have some purchase with sections of the professional classes alarmed at the rise of “populism”, but defending it politically plays into the hands of the right.The response to state strong-arming has to be based on a vision of genuinely representative institutions, accountable to citizens, not politicians on a vision of a system that is democratic and truly representative of the society it serves in all its ersity. If advocates of public media are not ambitious in meeting the dual challenges posed by anti-liberal nationalism and platform capitalism then together they will sweep away what remains of the great 20th-century broadcasting institutions.• Tom Mills is lecturer in sociology at Aston University and author of The BBC: Myth of a Public Service"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970be5bf39933e4e38ac006c9a63350b88f48da9/0_3_3189_1913/master/3189.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83a5042b4996da3ed9b9e00b44426e02","title":"italy progressives sardines salvini election far right","story":"Supporters of Italy’s centre-left Democratic party (PD) breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday evening as their candidate in Emilia-Romagna saw-off competition from Matteo Salvini’s far-right League to win the regional elections. That defeat here was even a prospect, though, shows just how much Italy’s political geography has changed.Historically Emilia-Romagna, in the north of the country, is a bedrock of communism and has had an unbroken string of leftist governments since the second world war. But the left has been losing ground since the financial crisis of 2008 – as in so much of the continent – with austerity-stricken rural communities and provincial towns in particular drifting rightwards. Winning in the region would have been a real coup for Salvini, who took personal control of the local campaign.The most immediate implication of Sunday’s result will be to prop-up the current government, which now looks set to endure for the foreseeable future. Again, this has less to do with the virtues of the PD itself than the comparatively dire straits of their lead coalition partners, the Five Star Movement (M5S) – which was happily partnered with the League before Salvini broke ranks in a botched attempt to grab power for his own party last August.With the M5S in chaos, and left-leaning voters swinging to PD, Sunday’s elections have confirmed a shift in the power balance inside the coalition government. Having picked up leftwing swing voters from its senior partners, the PD, the junior partners, will now dictate the political agenda. In a potential sign of the changes ahead, government ministers have already suggested abolishing the “security decree”, a piece of legislation passed by the League-M5S coalition to criminalise NGOs and iniduals who aid refugees. Overturning this law is one of very few explicit policy proposals supported by participants in the Sardines movement – the PD is trying to send a message to the congregations in the piazzas that the party is taking their concerns seriously. Meanwhile, the M5S remains the only Italian party that consistently emphasises the climate emergency, and is still working towards some kind of green new deal for Italy. Committing to this in more concrete terms now seems its best chance at avoiding a further collapse in support.What’s most interesting about these elections, then, is the extent of the Sardines’ sudden influence. By manipulating the main parties’ fears of Salvini this makeshift movement has not only blocked the right: it has effectively made the ruling coalition dependent on their endorsement. For now, the organisers are playing down the possibility of forming their own party. This seems wise. While being outsiders has its drawbacks, it has enabled them to avoid self-defeating echo chambers and foster a remarkable pluralism that has been key to their success.The Sardines are not here to save the old left. Instead their task is more foundational: to rebuild a culture of political participation, and demonstrate to Italy’s sceptical population that grassroots politics and activism can yield results – especially so soon after the M5S’s own failed experiment in “direct democracy”. That they’ve succeeded in this to some degree, in a country where pessimism has become so deeply ingrained is already a minor miracle. If this belief in collective action can be maintained, the League’s road to power may not be as smooth as the pollsters would have it.• Jamie Mackay is a writer and translator based in Florence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c400afa7a9baf44b5b7e3dae31efe8e1b4e09e3/0_342_5272_3164/master/5272.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bb0122b2b2492ee51ec6ecdfb68905d","title":"i worry for my teenage boys the beauty standards for young men are out of control","story":"From men’s magazines to the chiselled gods of Love Island, boys are inundated with messages to both bulk up and moisturise. It all reminds me of my own youth, much of it wasted on bulimiaIt’s that time of the month when an ominous thud through the letterbox heralds the arrival of my 17-year-old son’s Men’s Health magazine. As I pick it up, my eyes narrow in suspicious disapproval. What glistening slab of mesomorph flesh will be on the cover this time? What should my boy build, crush, smash or ignite this month? What body part needs to be dominated? It’s almost certainly something to do with abs: a cursory review of back issues lying around the house reveals only one cover star allowed to wear a top. Men’s Health is no country for the dad bod or for the scrawny goths I idolised during my adolescence: the sheer acreage of veiny thoroughbred muscle on show is enough to give anyone a complex. Honestly, it’s so depressing. Isn’t adolescence hard enough without discovering that even your calves need to be bulked up? What even is a deltoid and can’t we just leave it alone?Yet it’s unfair to single out Men’s Health, which has plenty of good, thoughtful coverage of male mental health and stress issues amid all the hard, lean, fat-burning content. It’s also pretty quaint to think any part of the struggling magazine industry could be having a serious impact on boys’ body image with a whole digital world of #fitspo and #workout posts to obsess over, and the chiselled gods of Love Island everywhere in their tiny trunks. The lack of variety among this years’ candidates is as predictable as it is disappointing: hairless and six-packed, with arms like giant hams and thighs like tree trunks, they all have precisely the unattainable look my boys’ generation seems to aspire to.With two teenage sons, the whole uneasy business of young men’s body image is very immediate for me. Protein is a household deity and our cupboards are full of pre- and post-workout powders and potions with violently overwrought names (Beast, Curse, X-Plode, Venom). The parents of other teenage boys I know report the same one of my friends even wrote a poem about her son’s protein powders sharing a shelf with her dad’s ashes.Boys care about how they look in more unexpected ways, too. My sons’ bathroom shelf has a Boots’ worth of scrubs and moisturisers, AHA peels and facial oils. One of my boys even asked me to buy him £40 eye cream. Eye cream! I’m 45 and I can’t be bothered with eye cream. At 15 and 17, they and their mates glow with health and youth and a single moment spent worrying about how they look seems to me a ludicrous waste of time.Of course it’s not bad to care about your health and your appearance at their or at any age. There’s certainly nothing admirable about my own lapse into neglected cronedom, exfoliating with a crusty flannel once a week. On one level, you could argue that they are an informed generation, practising self-care, exercising regularly and eating well. It’s the kind of stuff the runaway popularity of Queer Eye has reminded us many older men neglect.But at an age when body image is fragile and your sense of self is in flux, it’s so easy for looking after yourself to shade into obsession. I should know: part of my visceral reaction to this stuff is a product of my own history. I used to read women’s health and fitness magazines religiously on the way to the clinic where I was treated as an outpatient for bulimia in my 20s, internalising the diet tips and eating plans that seemed to validate my rules, restrictions and rituals. I wasted years of my life on this stuff no wonder a cover line such as: “Return to slender for good today!” makes me bristle.My boys are probably fine: they like a biscuit as much as a facial serum. But I can’t help worrying for the vulnerable ones, the ones like me, who will take this stuff and turn it into a joyless obsession. I managed it back when I needed to go to WHSmith to fuel my disorder now there’s a whole digital industry to feed the beast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e493438bafcee7ddf1c17f274863acc8f1ba6fc4/0_293_3805_2283/master/3805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85e7778af2a24625971b4513724475e","title":"kobe bryant remember his accuser","story":"Obituaries for the NBA star rolled in hours after his death. Yet most focused on the easiest-to-understand parts of the storyNine people were on the helicopter that crashed outside the wealthy enclave of Calabasas, California, on Sunday. The wreckage of the aircraft scattered across an area the size of a football field, and a day later the LA coroner’s office was still gathering remains from the site. The helicopter had reportedly taken off in dense fog en route to a girls’ basketball tournament in nearby Thousand Oaks, California, where some of the passengers were set to compete: among those on board was 13-year-old Gianna Bryant, an aspiring basketball player. The helicopter belonged to her father, the basketball superstar Kobe Bryant, who was also on board, and reportedly it was decked out like a limousine, with a cavernous interior and soft leather seats. There were no survivors.The death of Kobe Bryant has shocked sports fans and observers in part because he seemed like the sort of person who could never die. On the court, he moved with an uncommon skillfulness and grace, moving the ball from his opponents’ reach with the alacrity and sleight of hand of a magician, leaping into the air with the elegant reach of a ballerina. Though he had a thin jaw and hollow cheeks, his face had something boyish about it. Maybe it was because he had rocketed to fame as a teenager, recruited to the NBA straight out of high school. Or maybe it was the dimple that appeared when he smiled, which he did often and easily. With his alarming physical skill and his aura of joyfulness and minor arrogance, he seemed to possess a permanent and transcendent youthfulness, as if he was always going to be a teenager. In reality, he was old for an athlete when he retired in 2016. He died at 41.Obituaries and hagiographies for Bryant rolled in the hours following the crash, and most of them focused on the parts of the story that were easiest to understand tragedy of his sudden death, the beauty of his athletic skill, now lost forever. They carefully and conspicuously elided one of the most significant episodes of Bryant’s public life: that in 2003, a woman said that he raped her in his room at the Colorado hotel where she worked as a concierge. She was strikingly young, too: at the time she says he raped her, the woman was just 19.The rape accusation defined Bryant’s career during the mid-aughts. First, it was the subject of a criminal trial, in which it was revealed that Bryant had first denied having any contact with the accuser, then changed his story when confronted with evidence by the police – evidence such as the bruise on her neck, consistent with her claim that Bryant had choked her, as well as the tears and bruises on her genitals, his semen inside her, and her blood on his shirt. During the criminal proceedings, the media and Bryant’s legal team used the accuser’s real name repeatedly, and dragged out lurid details of her sexual and psychiatric history as evidence that she couldn’t be trusted. She was hounded by the media, smeared as slutty and crazy in print, and threatened by fans. Eventually, she stopped cooperating with the investigation. This could be because she made the whole thing up, and realized that she made a mistake. That is possible. It is also possible, and more likely, that she stopped cooperating because she was 19, terrified, and facing the full force of media hostility and the legal resources of a very rich, globally popular man.The criminal case was dropped and the accuser filed a civil suit, which Bryant settled in 2005. The payout is confidential, but was rumored to be about $2.5m. Bryant’s reputation recovered, the episode behind him, and he regained sponsorship deals with companies like Coca-Cola and Nike. He soon signed a seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, worth $136m. He bought his wife a comically gigantic diamond ring, seemingly to apologize.Now that Bryant is dead, it is likely that for his accuser, the traumas of the trial and media attention will be reproduced in miniature. She might be hounded online, or asked for comment by reporters. She might receive threats. At the very least, she will be reminded of what were probably the worst months of her life. For her, we can wish security and peacefulness and loving, supportive surroundings in what is likely a more complicated and distressing time for her than we can imagine. We can wish her safety, and privacy.But to those mourning for Bryant as they remembered him – as an athlete, or a philanthropist, or as an avatar of youthfulness, skill and success – these wishes can seem very inconvenient, even insulting to their grief. In the hours after Bryant’s death, any mention of the rape accusation on social media was met with derision, contempt or calls not to speak ill of the dead. There is a sense that the alleged rape is minor compared with the rest of Bryant’s legacy, that the pain of his young accuser is irrelevant, and should not be debited from Bryant’s moral account. This chorus has put feminists in the position of making the assertion that rape is more morally significant than basketball.At the same time, it is difficult not to sympathize with those who are grieving Bryant, those fans for whom he inspired envy and awe. To some of them, the rape accusation might be unbelievable, an anecdote that does not temper or complicate their grief but rather intensifies it: they may see him as a victim of a lie, a vengeful and possibly racist one. Others, more darkly, might believe the accusation but think that it reflects well on Bryant, seeing sexual violence not as a betrayal of the hope that he symbolized but as a sign of the youthfulness and masculine vitality that he displayed with such beauty on the court. There are people – men, mostly – who think of rape this way: not as a brutal violation of a woman but as a signal of a man’s liveliness.But the reality is that most of those who are grieving Bryant are simply not thinking about his accuser very much at all. That something happened between them is all most of us will ever know about her, but it is just one of scores of things we know about him.For my part, I find myself thinking less about Bryant than about his young daughter, Gianna, who died with him in the crash. Those who wanted to believe in the better vision of Bryant noted that he was taking her to her own basketball tournament. This, they implied, was a sign that he could not be a misogynist, or a rapist, because he was choosing to spend time with his daughter, choosing to invest in her talent, her ambition. It is hard to accept that this Bryant, this version of him as a kindly father spending time with a young girl, could coexist within the same man who put his hands around the neck of a woman not much older than that daughter, and squeezed. That both of these people could potentially live inside one body – the attentive father, the allegedly violent rapist – is the great mystery and contradiction of Kobe Bryant’s life.Gianna was 13 when she died, a year that is euphemistically referred to as a “tender age”. It’s tender in part because 13 is around the age when girls become aware of the role that they are ageing into, aware of the injustices, indignities, violences and double standards that will be imposed on them when they are women, because they are women. By 13, you grow breasts and start getting catcalled it becomes clear that some men will express their desire for you along with resentment and malice. For Gianna, a black girl growing into a black woman, the injustices and indignities she was facing down were even greater and crueler. Every woman navigates the perils of womanhood in her own way, and maybe Gianna would have been skillful, or lucky. Maybe she would have been insulated from sexism by her father’s fame and money, or by the education that he could have bought her maybe she would have developed a deep inner reservoir of dignity and resolve that some women draw on in the face of sexist injustice. Maybe she would have grown up to resent her father for the alleged attack, or maybe she would have forgiven him, made some kind of peace in adulthood with his darkness and inconsistencies. We simply do not know what kind of person she would have become. Now, we will never know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef6e880eb79cc6502004bf51ed0715e26504c9b/0_55_4599_2759/master/4599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f3446c1f360df1fc3a97f8114ecad0e","title":"labour deputy leader policies","story":"Those who need us most don’t believe that politicians understand them. We need to reconnectOn 12 December, millions of people voted against policies that would have improved their lives, and which they generally supported, because they didn’t trust us with their vote. That’s one hell of a wake-up call.If we’re going to win back power, we need to convince people that the policies we’re offering aren’t just morally right but that they can and will be achieved.While our vision for the world may seem bold in comparison with a status quo that has existed for far too long, we offer practical solutions to the challenges so many face in our daily lives. I believed in our manifesto. I believed in it because I came to the Labour party through real-life experiences. I was pregnant at 16, and needed a council house and social security to look after my son. My local Sure Start centre, one result of a flagship Labour policy, helped me get back into work and education. I joined a trade union and learned how to stand up for myself and the other low-paid women I worked alongside as a home help.For me, investing in council housing makes simple economic sense. A proper social safety net for when you’re down on your luck just seems like a solid idea. When you’ve tried to care for elderly people in 15-minute visits while you’re struggling to pay your own bills, a fully funded care service that treats people with dignity isn’t radical – it’s basic human decency. I know that far too many people work too hard, for too long, for too little, and that politics has the power to change that. But those same people who need us most don’t believe that politicians get it. Sometimes I’ve wondered myself. That’s why I’m standing. Because I do get it, and I know how to show that Labour does, too.I call my pitch “everyday socialism”: a transformative policy platform rooted in the day-to-day lives of people across our country and communicated in a commonsense way.Every day our party and our movement can demonstrate in real ways how we change lives for the better. A socialism lived and enacted in the communities, the cities and the towns, and demonstrated in the everyday lives of those we need to win at the next election.We need these policies – they go to the very heart of our purpose as a party – but our relationship with our voters can’t simply be transactional – “vote for us and you’ll get X, Y and Z” – if we are to truly rebuild Labour as a movement that achieves deep and lasting change.We need to reconnect and rebuild trust as a matter of urgency to fight back against this Tory government’s cuts, privatisation and attacks on the most vulnerable. That goes for the whole country, from the so-called “Red Wall” to the inner-city communities sharing similar struggles and in Scotland, Wales, the east and south-west – and as a party with more than half a million members, we have the people power to do that.We have an abundance of talent – trainers and educators, social media experts, videographers, organisers and workplace reps, speechwriters and speech givers – and as deputy leader, I want to bring it all together in a Labour community that stands together to fight the other side, not each other.There will be adversity in the years to come. Each and every cut will hurt, because we know we should be in power to stop it. But I’m a fighter. I’ve overcome many barriers to become an MP, let alone to be in this contest. I’ve taken on bad bosses and won. I’ve beaten the Tories in Westminster and stopped cuts, closures and privatisations.If we use our collective strength to be active in communities – alongside an everyday socialist agenda – we will not only regain trust and win at the ballot box, we’ll do what we all joined Labour for in the first place: we’ll make a difference.That’s what this is all about. Labour in power can and will change people’s lives for the better. It made a difference to my life. It gave me the power to speak for myself, the power to speak for others, and the power to give them a voice of their own. So if you put your faith in me, I will fight to make that difference – and I will fight to win.• Angela Rayner is MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and shadow secretary for education"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93167704a8b817ad82600423cf0b22c4d1473020/172_0_1565_940/master/1565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad6b98b54074042b23fb473126ca59b8","title":"jimmy kimmel honors kobe bryant","story":"The Los Angeles-based host honors the late Lakers star, and late-night hosts discuss latest in the Trump impeachment trialJimmy Kimmel devoted his entire show on Monday evening to honoring Kobe Bryant, Los Angeles’s beloved basketball legend who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday morning at age 41. “We don’t have a studio audience here tonight, because going forward with a comedy show didn’t feel right considering what happened yesterday,” Kimmel said. Instead, Kimmel paid an emotional tribute to Bryant’s 20-year career as a Los Angeles Laker and city figure with clips from his 15 appearances on the show over the years. Bryant died with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven friends traveling to his daughter’s basketball game, “and that was a punch in the gut for many of us,” Kimmel said. “He was just the last person you could ever imagine something like this happening to. He was so strong, and handsome, and smart, and energetic – he was a hero.”Kimmel clarified that he didn’t mean a hero like firefighters and first responders, “who actually save lives, I don’t mean to compare what he did for a living to what they do … But Kobe was a hero in the way Superman is a hero. He was so big it was almost like he was a fictional character.“Those of us who loved the Lakers know it seemed like he always came through, he always showed up to save the day,” Kimmel continued. “He wanted to save the day. He had a force of will. He never gave up.”Los Angeles loved him because he was supremely talented and worked harder than anyone, Kimmel said, “But we also loved him because he was ours.” Bryant came to LA as a teenager in 1996 and played 20 years for the Lakers, retiring in 2016 after helping win five championships for the city.Kimmel also touched on his personal relationship with Bryant, with whom he had “many conversations” off-camera over the years, ones that “always involved his daughters, always. Once he retired from basketball, his life revolved around their lives. He was very proud of them, he loved being a father.”“I know he was not a perfect person, I understand that. My intention is not to canonize him or make judgments about things I don’t know anything about,” Kimmel said, perhaps alluding to the 2003 sexual assault case against Bryant which was eventually dropped after the accuser declined to testify (Bryant and the accuser later reached a settlement in a civil case). “But I will say: he loved his family, he worked very hard, and he brought a lot of joy to a lot of people in this city, and we’re gonna miss him.”On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah was back to business dissecting the latest in the Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Monday’s arguments by Trump’s lawyers offered a defense that, said Noah, “basically boils down to this: one, this is just a political attack by the Democrats. Two, Trump did nothing wrong, and three, there are no firsthand witnesses who spoke to Trump about a quid pro quo.”The last point “is pretty ballsy”, said Noah, “because how are you gonna complain about having no eyewitnesses when you’re the ones blocking the eyewitnesses?” You can’t have it both ways, Noah argued. “It’s like if you’re a vegan, you can’t complain about all the chickpeas in your life. You chose that chickpea life.”The witnesses question is further complicated by news this weekend that Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, will release a book claiming Trump personally told him to withhold aid to Ukraine until he got information on Joe Biden – “which is the whole thing,” said Noah. “This is the heart of the entire impeachment thing. So I don’t know how Senate Republicans can justify not hearing from both sides.“Imagine, an eyewitness to a murder wanted to testify and the judge just refused.”On Late Night, Seth Meyers ticked through the list of evidence against Trump that has emerged since the impeachment trial. “You’ve got to give Trump credit,” said Meyers. “One crime isn’t enough for him. He’s always gotta do like five at once. He’s like a guy who steals a camcorder, sneaks into a movie theater without paying, illegally records and then sells the bootleg DVDs on the street, gets arrested, busts out of jail, and then holds a screening of the movie in a house he broke into.”For example, Meyers said, Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani who Trump has claimed not to know, brought receipts attesting to Trump’s knowledge of the removal of US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in a deal for dirt on Biden. Parnas handed the US attorney’s office in New York secret taped footage of Trump telling Parnas to “get rid of her”, about Yovanovitch. “Get her out tomorrow. I don’t care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.”“How is it possible that so many people have secret recordings of the president?” Meyers wondered. “I mean, this idiot has had more microphones and hidden cameras on him than Jim Carrey in the Truman Show.”Bolton’s book and Parnas’s receipts demonstrate “why it’s so crucial that the Senate vote to allow new evidence to be considered in the impeachment trial”, Meyers concluded, “because almost every day new evidence emerges”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f14c4b2bb713620ef9487fcc5577357d3b6e9ae/17_0_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244c06cfdfeffc6fd127d3761106790d","title":"google tech giants spark record rise in sales of renewable energy","story":"Amount of clean energy bought by companies triples in two years, with Google biggest buyerThe world’s biggest tech companies fuelled a record surge in the amount of renewable energy sold directly to global corporations last year, according to new figures.The amount of clean energy from renewable energy developers bought by companies has tripled in the past two years, driven by a growing corporate appetite for sustainable energy.Tech giants including Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft have emerged as the biggest buyers of renewable energy to help power their data centres.BloombergNEF found that global corporations have purchased enough clean energy in the past 12 years to eclipse the entire energy capacity of countries such as Vietnam or Poland.Tech firms bought almost a quarter of the renewable energy sold to global companies last year, according to the report.The largest buyer is Google, which last year revealed plans for the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. Google’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said the clean energy deal would include 18 separate agreements to supply Google with electricity from wind and solar projects across the world.The market for PPAs has grown rapidly in North America, where most such purchases are made, but a growing number of deals were struck in Europe and Latin America.Kyle Harrison, the lead author of the report, said: “The clean energy portfolios of some of the largest corporate buyers rival those of the world’s biggest utilities. These companies are facing mounting pressure from investors to decarbonise.”These sustainability commitments are expected to fuel clean energy investments of almost $100bn over the next decade to build 105GW of new solar and wind power plants globally, said BNEF.Harrison said these sustainability commitments would “ensure that clean energy procurement from corporations continues to thrive” but that support from policymakers and investors would be key to meeting their growing appetite for clean energy.“The ball is in the court of utilities, policymakers and investors. They will need to meet these buyers in the middle, especially in nascent markets for corporate procurement,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17faf53d3a91b3687222a4b8a96033a39ec6d238/0_260_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5fc72e29cf83a520a844abcd35b90b","title":"tell us about your most creative solution to combat waste","story":"Increasing waste is a big global problem.

No wonder Robert De Niro can’t bear to lookFor years, the annual Oscar nominees luncheon photo has followed a very strict blueprint. Every single person nominated for an award, be they cast or crew, attends a meal together. Afterwards, they are manhandled willy-nilly into an unflattering multi-tiered crescent next to curtains of nondescript colour so someone can take their picture from afar. Think of it as a wedding picture for people better than you.But this year things changed. The Oscar nominees luncheon photo for 2020 has taken place in an empty white vortex. It’s still an incredibly unflattering photograph, but it has the additional benefit of making the attendees look like they’ve just died and emerged blinking into the afterlife. Here, as usual, are this year’s winners:Even if he’s unsuccessful on Oscar night, documentary director Khan deserves credit for understanding the dynamics of a group photo. This is the Oscars, so he knows his competitors will mostly be grey-haired middle-aged men in dark suits. By going so red, with such commitment, he deserves our respect.(Main picture: third row, second from left)Much was made of the primarily plant-based menu served at the luncheon. The nominees ate roasted maitake mushroom mixed with forbidden black rice, winter squash, cauliflower and red curry. And yet Todd Phillips turned up in a white suit. He spent the entire meal teetering precariously on the edge of a catastrophic curry spill that would have ruined his photo forever. And yet he did it anyway. How brave. How edgy.(Main picture: sixth row, sixth from left)Let’s do the honourable thing and blame the photographer for this.

We need to see a film where Kathy Bates and Sandy Powell get trashed in Vegas, and it needs to be good enough for them both to be invited back next year.(Main picture: third row, 12th from right)This is very sweet. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are married, and nominated for the songs they wrote together for Frozen II. They’ve been married since 2003, which is a lifetime in Hollywood terms. And yet apparently they do not know how to hold hands. How does this even work? They both look like they were doing inidual bicep curls, and awkwardly attempted to join them together at the top. It’s weird. I’m frightened.Most people at the luncheon understood the dress code and stuck to it no matter what. Others found clever ways to subvert it, maybe by forgoing a tie. But Quentin Tarantino cares so little about rules that he rocked up in something that made him look like he came fifth in a semi-professional 10-pin bowling league in 1958. No wonder Robert De Niro can’t make eye contact with him.(Main picture: fourth row, seventh from left)The most ostentatious luncheon attendees are always the ones who opt for unconventional hats. Buckley gives off the look of someone who went to the event in a baseball cap as a surly “screw you” to the comfortable formality of the Academy, only to bottle it in front of his heroes by turning it around and pushing it all the way up to the top of his head where nobody could see it. But we can see it. Oh, we can see it.(Main picture: fifth row, second from left)Randy Newman has been nominated for more Oscars than you could even count. He’s done this before, countless times.

Set against the rising Italian fascist regime, this chirpy animation has an oddly noticeable gangster-film influence. After absconding from the RAF, Porco Rosso transforms back into a human, literally and metaphorically.Though lacking the stunning visuals of Studio Ghibli’s best-known films, this portrait of a suburban family compensates with comedy. Episodic sketches of quotidian drama, in newspaper comic-strip style, are punctuated by lines of Bashō’s poetry. An adaptation of the manga series Nono-Chan, this was Studio Ghibli’s first entirely digital work.Isao Takahata directs this leisurely, meditative account of a woman nearing 30, experiencing pressure to get married. She takes leave from work and heads to the countryside, accompanied by the memory of her cringe-worthy 10-year-old self and an east-European-inspired soundtrack. Most of the action unfolds as the credits roll.A film directed by Miyazaki’s son, Gorō, this study of port town Yokohama in the wake of the Korean war twists into a strange adolescent love story. In memory of her ship captain father, a girl raises flags visible from the harbour, unwittingly attracting the attention of her classmate.A homage to The Borrowers, this is Studio Ghibli’s version of the celebrated story of tiny people who “borrow” things. Its animators delight in minuscule detail: a cup brimming with a single drop of tea, wallpaper made of leaves. Featuring the voice of Saoirse Ronan, this is as heart-warming as Mary Norton’s original.A tragicomedy on sweeping urban expansion, blind to the lives of other species and spirits. Riled by humans destroying their forest, a group of tanuki (racoon dogs) revolt. They relearn the ancient Buddhist art of shapeshifting in attempts to sabotage construction work. Despite its humour, the reality of this film strikes hard.Studio Ghibli’s most recent film to date, this follows a troubled teenager sent to stay with her foster mother’s relatives. Bewitched by a local salt-marsh mansion, she pays nightly visits to the ghost of the girl who lived there. An eerie film with an ending neatly wrapped up.A quietly revelatory narrative of a student realising his feelings for his ex-classmate as he glimpses her on a train platform. Produced by younger staff, this film is a deviation from the full-blown fantasy Studio Ghibli is known for. Instead, this is a subtle and honest film about self-recognition.With its origin in one of Japan’s oldest manuscripts, the mythical life of Princess Kaguya (voiced by Chloë Grace Moretz for its English language dub) is illustrated in elegant, understated strokes of watercolour. Haunting artistically and musically, the princess’s feelings of relegation and harassment in a man’s world feel raw and, at moments, untethered in Isao Takahata’s final film.The second of Studio Ghibli’s aviation-themed films, this is the animation house at peak visual prowess. “Ghibli” was the nickname of a second world war Italian aircraft its moustachioed designer Caproni appears in the dreams of engineer Jiro Horikoshi in this poignant animation, which captures the preciousness of life.One of Studio Ghibli’s most bizarre premises for a film (and that’s from the creators of Porco Rosso). Schoolgirl Haru is abducted by a herd of cats and coerced into marriage with a royal feline. A sequel of sorts to Whisper of the Heart, this is a cat owner’s fever dream.Set in a spore-infested future swarming with immense insects, this is the story of a young princess destined to return the world to its habitable state. A psychedelic sci-fi slash fantasy-adventure influenced by Isaac Asimov and Tolkien, while also reminiscent of Star Wars. Produced before Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985, Miyazaki here sets down environmental concerns that become a staple of his later work. This earned the film a recommendation from WWF.John Denver’s saccharine Country Roads is this film’s opening number, the sentimentality of which is steered into an uplifting and startling romance. A lesson that we should always follow cats on the train, Shizuku (voiced by Brittany Snow) finds a reverie-inducing world of antiques, violin-makers and cat figurines to contrast her humdrum (but sensitively depicted) Tokyo home life. As love is kindled between Shizuku and the antique seller’s son, she becomes determined to work on her talents and ambitions.Vaguely based on The Little Mermaid: when a reckless fish spirit dashes away from home she is saved from the sea by a young boy. Ensuing feelings make her yearn to be human, hurling the natural balance of the world off-kilter. Although its child protagonists are far too young to promise to love each other, this whimsical marine animation, featuring Cate Blanchett as the radiant and ginormous Goddess of Mercy, is one of Studio Ghibli’s best.Gorō Miyazaki’s directorial debut. He bore the huge burden of following up his father’s legacy while simultaneously being the first to adapt Ursula K Le Guin’s Earthsea series, an adaptation that she later disowned due to its departure from her books. While the film may lack the complexity of Le Guin’s narratives, this is a chilling representation of lurking corruption, plaguing the society of a fantastical world as a young prince flees the swelling shadow in his soul.The stuff of childhood nightmares. After her parents turn into pigs, Chihiro is trapped in the spirit world. Forced to work in warty Yubaba’s bathhouse until she can free her parents, the young girl navigates the spirit world, a place both tranquil and terrifying. The result of Hayao Miyazaki’s mission to create a feisty heroine for young female viewers, this is one of Studio Ghibli’s greatest triumphs.In Studio Ghibli’s first official film, conflicting forces tussle over the treasures of a floating island. The legendary root of western and eastern civilisation, Laputa’s evil heir Muska (Mark Hamill) returns to seize power. His plans are foiled by a young girl and a robot that, while at first appearing sinister, tends to the island’s flora and fauna. Miyazaki confessed that the village in this film channelled the Welsh mining towns with which he became familiar on his travels.Emblematic of the Ghibli franchise, the snoozing woodland spirit Totoro has permeated global culture. In this simple story, two young girls are left to fend for themselves while their father is working and their mother is in hospital. The cuddly Totoro is on hand during emergencies, rescuing the children from the rain and summoning a smirking cat-shaped bus.Based on Eiko Kadono’s acclaimed novel about a teenage witch, this is the story of 13-year-old Kiki (voiced by Kirsten Dunst), who clambers on to her broom and goes in search of a new town in which to settle. Kiki struggles to find her footing in the developing world but ingeniously fashions her own delivery service for a bakery. An exuberant film about an enterprising young woman a shame that the tragic loss of her sassy cat’s voice is underplayed.Poor Sophie (voice acted by Emily Mortimer and Jean Simmons) bears the brunt of several magical feuds in this fantastical animation, cursed to appear as an old woman. She finds employment as housekeeper for a narcissistic wizard and becomes embroiled in his resistance of a war stirring between kingdoms. (This, apprently, was Miyazaki’s filmic response to the Iraq conflict). A potent, affecting story of inner identity and beauty, loosely adapted from the novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones.Speaking strongly to our present climate crisis, this monumental animation centres around a stand-off between iron manufacturers and ancient forest spirits. Further afield from the conflict, Prince Ashitaka is cursed by a raging boar spirit and forced to voyage to Irontown, there encountering ferocious Princess Mononoke. Miyazaki manages to create nuanced characters on both sides of the battle the resounding message, as in many of his films, is to cultivate a caring and symbiotic relationship between humanity and nature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a5774b243fb68ba4774c5bd6f12f86efc98871/0_243_7212_4328/master/7212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8abf0cdd3548ddd023bd8aebc1671f4a","title":"do i really need to preheat the oven kitchen aide","story":"Do we have to wait for the oven to come up to temperature before putting anything in it?The bread recipe I follow says to put it in a preheated oven for 25-35 minutes, or until golden brown. So, basically, you bake it until it’s done – why, then, do I need to preheat?Peter, ExeterLet’s not get all pedantic and ask why cookery writers persist with the term “preheat”, rather than plain old “heat”, seeing as that’s all they’re telling you to do, anyway. Instead, we’ll stay on safer(ish) ground and ask why so many recipes start with this instruction in the first place.As consultant chef Rosie Sykes explains, “It’s the culinary equivalent of hitting the ground running. Some dishes, such as bread and cakes, require an immediate blast of heat, either to push them into action or to make them set as fast as possible.” The same goes for roast meat, which, unless you sear it before (or after) it spends time in the oven, needs some exposure to high temperatures to kickstart both the caramelisation and the Maillard reaction on which so much of its, er, “meaty” flavour relies.But that’s not the only reason to heat an oven in advance, says Sykes, who earned her kitchen stripes under two giants of modern British cookery, Joyce Molyneaux at the Carved Angel in Dartmouth, Devon, and Shaun Hill at Merchant House in Ludlow, Shropshire. “Other dishes – anything with a pastry base, say, or a souffle – benefit from ‘under heat’ the moment they go in an oven, so when you turn it on, put in a thickish baking tray to warm up.”This will all still happen if you baked the loaf from cold, Glazer accepts, but only very sluggishly: “The worry is that, by the time the oven is up to speed, the yeast’s leavening ability and the tension developed in the shaping may both have expired, so you’ll end up with a flat, dry loaf.” The other vital factor is steam. “Steam delays the formation of the crust, which allows the bread to reach its full volume by keeping the outside soft and pliable while the middle expands and bakes.” And you just don’t get steam in a cold oven. (One way around that is to put the dough in in a lidded cast-iron pot, Glazer says, because that in effect turns the pot into a micro-oven where the loaf will prove and bake at the same time, and in which any steam released is conveniently trapped.)On balance, then, Glazer, who happily self-identifies as a total flour geek, says the benefits of preheating outweigh all other considerations: “At the end of the day, any time, money and energy you think you’re saving by not preheating will be counteracted by the extra time and energy it takes for the loaf to bake.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

It was shortly after the end of the 2017-18 season and the then Tottenham manager had agreed a new five-year contract at the club. He saw the Denmark midfielder as one of his key lieutenants, fundamental to the next cycle, and he wanted to tell him that, to make a gesture which showed how much he respected him. And so he headed to Copenhagen to see him.Eriksen knew a place to eat. It was Bistro Boheme, the acclaimed restaurant of Per Thøstesen – who is also chef to the Denmark national team – where the Rossini gold selection caviar starter tips in at £70 and the wine list can be a lethal weapon in the hands of the wrong guest. Pochettino was accompanied by his wife, Karina, and his assistant manager, Jesús Pérez, and a very nice evening it was, too.A week or so later, Zinedine Zidane would shock everybody by resigning at Real Madrid – one of the clubs that coveted Pochettino – and the Spanish club promptly made a move for the Argentinian, only to be rebuffed. Pochettino had just extended at Spurs and there was no way he would bail on them, even if he knew there were problems in the pipeline regarding delivery of the new stadium.What Pochettino wanted to see from Eriksen was a similar commitment, although he did not travel to Copenhagen on club orders and he knew he could not force him to renew a contract which had two years left to run. Pochettino is acutely aware that players have to look after themselves because, once they are unwanted, their clubs will not think twice before cutting them loose.Did Eriksen want to leave Spurs at that point? It is unclear. But what was plain to Pochettino was that the Dane was considering his next move and that involved putting into place a possible exit strategy, something over which he had control. It meant not signing a new contract. From that evening at Bistro Boheme, if it was not already, the clock began to tick loudly on Eriksen’s Spurs future and what we saw on Tuesday – his completion of a €20m (£16.9m) transfer to Internazionale – was the result of him having played the longest of games. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200127-57121-gnl.fw.20200127.sj.fw2701.mp3 Eriksen joined Spurs from Ajax in what came to be known as the Bale summer of 2013 – the one in which Gareth Bale departed for Real Madrid and the club spent the £86m proceeds on seven new faces. As such, Eriksen has been around for long enough to read Spurs from the inside, to consider how they treated players and agents, and what the future held. His conclusions were not unreasonable. He knew the only way he would be able to drive a move away on his terms was to allow his contract to enter its final year.One of the issues that came to frustrate Pochettino before he parted ways with the club last November was the inability of the chairman, Daniel Levy, to sell players and provide room for the squad to evolve. Prior to Eriksen, only two frontline members of the squad were sold in the past two years: Mousa Dembélé and Kieran Trippier. The former had six months to go on his contract when he moved to Guangzhou R\u0026ampF for £11m the latter had three years remaining when he went to Atlético Madrid for £20m, making him something of an outlier.The market has changed and, for many Spurs players on good money, there have not been any buying clubs that can give them similar or better deals and pay a large fee on top. They have been stuck. Even Eriksen struggled to attract offers until Inter got the numbers to work, helped enormously by his contract having just six months remaining. Last summer, only Atlético made a firm move for him. What did not help Eriksen back then was the £130m price tag Levy put on him and, although it was understood to apply only to domestic suitors, it provided a high starting point for those in mainland Europe.Spurs have now lost one of their most gifted players of recent years for a relative pittance but, if the end was a little sour, Eriksen leaves a wealth of good memories. Pochettino called him “Golazo”, a Spanish term that essentially translates as “screamer” – as in, screaming goal – and there were plenty of those. Since Eriksen’s arrival in the Premier League, no player has scored more goals from outside the box than his 23 or more from direct free-kicks than his eight. No player has made more assists than his 62 or has created more chances (571).Those in the media became accustomed to Eriksen blanking them in the post-match mixed zone – saying nothing was part of the plan – and to pull that off takes a certain steeliness, which he has in abundance. Inside the club, meanwhile, he was known for his professionalism and consistency, with teammates respecting his tactical versatility, ability on each foot and stamina. No Spurs player would run further than him. Eriksen is the one that has got away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac755362e60766678d9b1467a23330c70f430cf7/125_489_5585_3351/master/5585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f8379134d39c23c9152269a37a48f56","title":"she cant say no the men who take breast milk from babies","story":"A study is looking into the coercive practice in Uganda, amid calls for the government to address the issue Jane’s* husband likes breast milk. “He says he likes the taste of it, and that it helps him in terms of his health. He feels good afterwards,” said the 20-year-old from Uganda, who has a six-month-old baby.Jane said her husband started asking for her milk the night she came home from the hospital after giving birth. “He said it was to help me with the milk flow. I felt it was OK.”Men drinking their partners’ breast milk is not uncommon in some areas of Uganda, and in parts of Tanzania and Kenya. It is now being linked to gender violence and coercive behaviour and there are concerns over the impact on babies’ nutrition. Little was known about the practice until Uganda’s minister of state for health, Sarah Opendi, broke the silence in parliament in 2018 and warned against “a growing culture of men demanding to suckle, which was becoming a problem for some breastfeeding mothers and their babies”.The reasons for the phenomenon, and its consequences, are now the subject of what is believed to be the first preliminary study into the practice, by Kyambogo University in Kampala and Britain’s University of Kent, supported by the Global Challenges Research Fund.“It was very much an exploratory mission. We didn’t know if we would find anybody willing to talk to us who admitted to doing it. We didn’t even really know if it was real or not,” said Dr Rowena Merritt, a British behavioural scientist who specialises in public health, and a lead researcher on the project.The study focused on the rural Buikwe district, in the central region, where the behaviour is reported to be common.Anonymised interviews were conducted with a group of four men who worked as “boda boda” motorcycle taxi drivers.“One said: ‘I know other men do it, but we’ve never talked about it.’ So that to me would suggest that it is a common behaviour, but it isn’t socially accepted,” said Merritt.The preliminary research suggested that men often drink before the child is fed, usually once a day, sometimes more frequently, and for about an hour at a time.The men said they found it energising. “It sustains me, I come home for lunch and it relieves stress in the middle of the working day,” said Thomas*.“There is a belief in some communities that breast milk has energising and curative powers, even curing diseases such as HIV and Aids and cancer,” said Dr Peter Rukundo, a senior lecturer at Kyambogo University who assisted with the research.The men also said it was a way of initiating sex and showing affection. “But then it is happening to women who have just given birth,” he added.One man told the researchers: “When breastfeeding, I feel like I’m being looked after like a child, and this becomes addictive. I feel like a prince.”Women did not seem to have much choice in the matter. “It appears to be a hugely coerced behaviour from the people we spoke to,” added Merritt.When asked what might happen if she said no, one woman replied: “I fear that my husband might go elsewhere if I wouldn’t let it happen.”Thomas admitted that resistance could result in the women being beaten. “She can’t say no because you become obsessed, it’s hard to stop. If women say no it can cause violence, it’s a big issue,” he said.The behaviour has been linked to gender-based violence in the Karamoja region in north-east Uganda. “The principal nutritionist has claimed that it is a common practice there in the form of violence, that when the men get drunk some went for the breasts forcefully,” said Rukundo.Health professionals, including midwives and nutritionists, told researchers about cases where babies had to be given formula milk because partners wanted the breast milk, and where women came to clinic with infected or bitten nipples caused by a man suckling. There are also risks to babies of cross-infection from the man’s saliva.“There is a gap in public awareness of the risks in such practices. But the challenge is we don’t have the evidence of the magnitude of this behaviour. We need a survey on prevalence,” said Rukundo.He also called on government and development partners to work together to mitigate harm. “We don’t have any clear message or deliberate effort, despite the health minister saying the issue is there. So, in a way, it is denial. If they remain silent, the issue will remain underground,” he said.Merritt added: “The fear for me, is the longer that this continues it will become part of the culture and tradition for the next generation. I see parallels with FGM.”*names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fd07f6b7687228f35b8b78be7768aca94d854a0/2_0_10639_6382/master/10639.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc0e412b0c8ac3ab76bccb501e1bbfd9","title":"i love my boyfriend so why do i fantasise about my workmate","story":"My boyfriend is like a member of the family. But although he’s kind and supportive, he doesn’t turn me onMy boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for four years. Two months after we started dating, his mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Devastatingly, his father also developed cancer and both died within two years. We became a serious couple very quickly as a result. We have been through a lot and I love him like family. However, I don’t feel sexually attracted and have always fantasised about exes while having sex. Six months ago, I met a colleague to whom I am very sexually attracted. I have not acted on this, but it makes me worry that I have suppressed needs. My boyfriend is a very kind and emotionally supportive partner but our sex life is failing. We now have sex about once every two months – when we do it is brief and I don’t orgasm.You may think that loving someone “like family” is a positive thing, but when it comes to sex it is not. In most human societies there are strong incest taboos, and these become engaged when a couple becomes too familial. To fix this you need some separation. Start pursuing different hobbies, meeting different people – anything that will help create inidual identities. Once you reach a certain level of iniduality, you may find that sexual attraction will emerge. But it is important to know that bereavement can trigger low libido, and that may be the case for both of you.

But the biggest secret is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. By  Samanth SubramanianLast March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys’ weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team’s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I’ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.Which is saying something, because I’m entering my fourth decade of addiction. In my quizzing, there is to be found a story of my life. It is the single constant to which I’ve clung as I bounced between schools, universities, jobs and cities. In India, where I grew up, my obsession began with inter-school quizzes: teams of two or three, sitting behind desks, fielding questions in turn. When I was eight, I took part in my first, in Delhi. We missed out on winning on a tie-breaker, and for a week afterwards, I replayed that moment in my mind so vividly that I found it hard to fall asleep at night. In 1999, when I went to an American university to study journalism, I discovered Quiz Bowl tournaments, for which we practised once a week, iding up into teams and holding mock-contests in empty classrooms late into the night. I returned to India and, while working as a reporter, sank into the circuit of “open” quizzes, so-called because anyone is free to form a team and take part. Three years ago, after my wife and I moved for a brief stint to Ireland, I joined the Dublin Quiz League, conducted in pubs but otherwise a serious affair with difficult questions.Everywhere I have lived, I have attempted the World Quizzing Championship – an exam-like solo affair held all over the world on a particular June day. Last year, nearly 3,000 people took part. Its 240 questions, to be answered in two hours, are set by a tight group of enthusiasts who run the International Quizzing Association. For much of the year, I begin my days with a dose of six questions emailed to me and thousands of other subscribers of Learned League – an online quiz that solicits new players only through referrals from existing ones, ides us all into small brackets, and pits us against each other. (This morning, bound as ever by honour to refrain from Googling, I answered questions on shibboleths, umami, Assassin’s Creed and Indian princely states, but blundered on Dora the Explorer and surf guitar.) During holidays with friends who are fellow addicts, we’ve sought out pub quizzes: light fixes when we were craving the hard stuff. I wish I could say that we thought of them as dips into the local pub culture of Colombo, or Madrid, or Seattle, or Edinburgh, but we really went just for the questions. Whatever I’m doing at any point of the day, it is probably safe to assume that I would rather be quizzing.We ended up not doing very well in Vegas 100 teams and 25 points separated us from the winner of the $13,000 top prize. It was a reminder of how my quizzing has not only defined my life but has, in turn, been defined by it. Even in our age, when practically all the information in the world is available on our phones, what you know best is often a product of where you have been. In my team were five men who had grown up in India. The sixth, the lone American, had to bear the burden of recalling Tuna Helper, Yoo-Hoo and other snacks from his childhood he was also the one we turned to when we needed to know the number of Canadian teams in the National Hockey League or the name of the country singer Tammy Wynette’s husband. We felt like a basketball team playing with our shoelaces tied together.That we got many answers right nonetheless was the result of a remarkable shift in quizzing culture over the past two decades – another way in which quizzing has closely tracked my life. I started quizzing when I had the sticky memory of a teenager my mind held facts without effort and yielded them instantly. Back in the 90s, quizzing demanded this quality above all else. As I got older, my mind shed some of its retentive powers. But quizzing, too, has changed its questions have come to privilege not just memory but also breadth, deduction and lateral thinking. This new shape was a response to the rise of the internet, and it called upon a truer, more natural form of our relationship with knowledge – of what it means to know the answer to a question.There isn’t even a word for us, really. Quiz players? Trivia fanatics? I prefer quizzers. But when I use that to describe myself to a civilian – to a non-quizzer – the inevitable inquiry follows: “What does that mean?” For that question, ironically, there is no easy answer.The problem is not that no one knows what a quiz is. Quite the contrary, in fact the problem is that nearly everyone has quizzed, or has at least seen a quiz, at some point in their lives. They have caught clips of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Or they have played a multiple-choice Friends trivia game online. Or they have been set a general knowledge quiz in school. Or they have learned to avoid the local pub on Tuesdays, when it hosts Trivia Night in 2013, The Publican, a trade magazine, found that 23,000 out of the UK’s 60,000-odd pubs have at least one quiz a week.Everyone knows how a quiz works: a question asked, an answer ventured, a binary verdict of correct or incorrect handed down, next question please. They suspect that quizzing depends upon an ability to soak up facts: capitals of US states, currencies of countries, names of authors, Academy award winners. Where they flounder is in imagining how something this commonplace can turn into a passion, into a marker of identity. A quizzer? It’s like describing yourself as a doodler or a shower-singer.The most visible quizzes, the ones on TV, are also those that least graze the lives of quizzers. I have been on the Indian edition of Mastermind, and I have friends who have appeared on Only Connect, Jeopardy! and Millionaire. But these were one-offs. The selection process is competitive, and there are too few shows to sustain the ardent quizzer. The most frequent, hardcore quizzing always happens under the radar, attended by the few dozen regulars in each city who never stop wondering why their tribe isn’t larger. For the Dublin Quiz League, we borrowed corner tables in pubs on slow weeknights: a quizmaster and two teams at each table, questions murmured out of earshot of the patrons sipping Guinness at the bar. In universities, Quiz Bowl tournaments requisition classrooms. In Bangalore, quizzes take place in a seminar hall rented from the Institution of Agricultural Technologists during holidays, when there isn’t an agricultural technologist for miles around. So many quizzes happen on Sundays that a passerby peeping into one of these rooms anywhere in the world might take in the hushed conferrals and the gnostic atmosphere and believe that a Christian cult’s prayer meeting is in session.In such quizzes, the material rewards are scanty, often non-existent. You compete for pride, and even that can only be enjoyed within the small, cramped confines of this subculture. The more pathetic the prize, it would seem, the greater the sincere quizzer’s dedication. In Amsterdam, where I once happened to be on holiday on the day of the World Quizzing Championship, I came an all-Netherlands third and won a Jabra Bluetooth earpiece. It is my most sophisticated piece of quiz loot ever. I still haven’t figured out how to sync it with my phone.When I was a member of the Pennsylvania State University Quiz Bowl Club, we would pool our money to rent a car, drive across two or three states and stay in a cheap motel near another university that was hosting a tournament. We would lug along “the Judge” – a buzzer set built into a briefcase, with protruding red and green lights, looking for all the world like a B-movie bomb. (If you brought along your own buzzer, you got $5 or $10 knocked off your registration fee.) All weekend, our squad of four played half-hour University Challenge-style games against other teams, buzzing inidually on 10-point questions and conferring on 30-point bonuses. The scorelines often ran tight, but the real drama was private, internal: the mortification at buzzing wrongly on a question your teammate surely knew the glee at encountering a question your team had come across in practice only the previous week. Nominally, the tournament produced a champion: the team that had won the most games, and that often received just a kitschy trophy for its labours. Come Sunday evening, we would pack up the Judge, hop back into the car, and reach our dorms close to midnight. Sometimes, we would read questions to each other on the way home.In India too, the most intense quizzing events occupy all of a weekend. Quiz festivals, we call them, as if we’re recognising them as rituals in the calendar of some deviant paganism. If you pass through the written preliminary round into the eight-team final, you will encounter some of the most elaborate quizzes on the planet one film quiz I attend every June plays almost 100 minutes of video, short snatches patiently clipped and reclipped to offer a clue or reveal an answer. Across seven or eight quizzes over three days, a quizzer might face as many as 600 questions. By Sunday evening, you feel as if someone has been punching you in the head you also feel deeply sorry that the weekend is over.To attend these contests, quizzers rearrange the furniture of their lives, budgeting their time away from their families, or ensuring that they don’t travel overseas for work during a quiz weekend. I know one quizzer who switched jobs because his city’s quiz scene wasn’t active enough I know another who scheduled his wedding to avoid a clash with a quiz. Once, while we were waiting around for a popular annual quiz to begin, a friend remarked that his wife was heavily pregnant he hoped she wouldn’t go into labour over the next few hours. That would be unfortunate, we agreed.“No, you don’t understand,” he said. “If my daughter’s born today, that means she’ll have a birthday party on this date every year. Which means I can never come to this quiz again.”Admitting to such a fevered love isn’t a good look, I realise. The very premise of quizzing can appear to be a fetishising of book learning: of facts memorised for their own sake, instead of being learned from any true engagement with life. At best, this can feel charmingly antique in the 21st century, when the internet and its infinite electronic lobes do our remembering for us. At worst, quizzers are thought to suck up facts only to win meaningless contests that cater to their intellectual vanities they are typecast as people who have such a transactional relationship with knowledge that they really can be said to know very little at all.But at its finest, quizzing today is never about shallow recall it’s an exercise in nimble thinking, and possibly the only forum where the entirety of your life – everything you’ve ever seen, read, tasted, heard, heard of, or lived through – can be marshalled as pure knowledge. A friend of mine, an English professor in a college in Bangalore, once called quizzing an act of bricolage – a term that the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used to describe how even a small number of ideas may be mixed and combined to create something novel and unforeseen. The process thrives on freshness and play, and it holds a sense of limitless possibility – of producing many, many things we never knew out of the few things we do know.The deconstruction of a question is one of quizzing’s high pleasures. Here’s one that I set for a quiz a few years ago. The root word is the proto-Indo-European bhel. Out of this springs a host of related words (in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese) and also an English word. Strangely, the English word is precisely the opposite of the others. The reason, it has been surmised, has to do with fire, bhel. The words of the Romance languages refer to the brightness of fire, but the English word refers to its final remains. What words are we talking about?The question is designed for teamwork and deductive leaps, not for quick familiarity with proto-Indo-European etymologies. The brightness of fire and its final remains evoke two images: the white heat of flame and the char left behind. They are opposites, most evidently, by virtue of their colours. If the English word describing the char is “black”, then the Romance counterparts must be translations of “white”: blanca, blanc, bianca, branca, all words that might very conceivably have derived from bhel.It’s a difficult question, but I love it for its feat of bricolage – for how it does so much with so little. The foreknowledge potentially required to answer it is minimal: really, just the word for “white” in any one of a number of European languages. You don’t need to speak fluent French or Spanish to have come across terms like carte blanche” or Casablanca, and the merest curiosity about their literal meanings will have yielded all that you require.But with this single key, such a rich universe is unlocked: the evolution of language, and its elemental roots the beautiful, contradictory union of black and blanc: everyday words which, at the slightest inquisitive tug, ulge their history. The answer is satisfying even if you don’t solve it. It has what University Challenge’s question-setters call “inherent interest”, and what Indian quizzers call “funda”, short for fundamental: an easy appeal for anyone, and a burst of joy at encountering an unsuspected elegance in the world.When I was 15 or 16, in 1997, we got our first internet connection at home, and I discovered Quiznet, a mailing list full of junkies like me. You could set a quiz and send it out people wrote to you with their attempts over the subsequent week, and then you released their scores and the correct answers. In my first Quiznet quiz, which included seven questions on cocktails, I asked: “Which cocktail, made of bourbon, sugar and mint, is associated with the Kentucky Derby?” Answer: the mint julep. I had read about the Kentucky Derby in a book I’ve forgotten its title, but the mint julep has stuck.This standard model of quizzing – short, stiff questions, to which you either knew the answer or you didn’t – had been around in India for decades. Its progenitor, in quizzing lore, was a Calcutta man named Neil O’Brien who had spent time in England, grown fond of its pub quizzes and taken the concept back with him. Even when he conducted his first quiz, at a parish hall in 1967, quizzing was a relatively young pursuit, in comparison to the life s of other pastimes. The Romans did not quiz. Neither did the Aztecs. We have no evidence of quizzing in Mughal India or Ming China. It didn’t feature among the parlour games of the 19th century. The Victorians preferred charades or squeak piggy squeak, a variation of blind man’s bluff – perhaps understandably, because at the time, to ask questions about distant countries or art or literature would have presumed an implausible breadth of access to texts and education.The first quizzes emerged, naturally, in schools, where students could be tested on a shared body of knowledge. King William’s College, on the Isle of Man, has wrung answers out of its pupils in an annual quiz that began in 1905. In 1934, the year O’Brien was born, the quiz’s categories included bishops, coinage and literary queens, and its questions already wore the garb of the cryptic-crossword clue for which it later became famous. “Who balked who of his fame ‘with a worm’?” If you didn’t recall that phrase from the 288-line Tennyson poem A Dream of Fair Women, you had only the slenderest hope of responding correctly with Cleopatra and Caesar. This was not a quiz for lackadaisical readers.In the US, the military tested basic knowledge as part of its Alpha examination of recruits. (A 1921 multiple-choice form asked: “The Penguin is a: Bird, Reptile, Insect.” No intimacies with Tennyson were required.) But for a while, as Alan Connor recounts in his book The Joy of Quiz, the purpose of this pursuit remained foggy, if intriguing. The two authors of Ask Me Another!, a compendium of questions published in 1928, thought it a fine idea to quiz celebrities and record their performances, but they were often met with confusion. “I didn’t quite understand just what it was he wanted to do to me,” the humourist Robert Benchley wrote after being approached by one of the authors. The book sold well, but it didn’t seem to spread the love very far. Why would anyone wish to commit such arcane details to memory, reviewers wondered. “A man who treasures up a piece of information like the height of the Brooklyn Bridge has a screw loose somewhere,” the New York World decided.By the time the second world war ended, though, the culture shifted, and quizzing came to be appreciated as entertainment, not imposition. The knowledge “bees” on British radio inspired quizzes in pubs and youth clubs. On US television, shows such as Twenty-One and The $64,000 Question drew rapt audiences. In 1953, US universities also started to compete in a radio programme called College Quiz Bowl it moved to TV as College Bowl and provided the template for University Challenge in Britain, which first aired on ITV in 1962.The questions in Quiz Bowl, College Bowl’s direct descendant, are thickly academic. When I first quizzed at university, I needed a few months to calibrate myself – to get used to dredging answers not out of my recreational reading but out of my textbooks and classroom lectures. But I came to relish the density of the toss-ups – the starter questions, as they are called on University Challenge – and how they unwrap themselves in orderly fashion. A question starts with the most opaque clues: “A wreath of flowers sent to this politician’s funeral is the origin for the name of the Primrose League.” More facts follow midway, perhaps at “He controversially took a loan from Lionel de Rothschild”, there is just enough light and enough material to buzz in with a guess. Certainly at the transparent end – “Name this Conservative prime minister of Jewish descent, the rival of William Gladstone” – we know the answer is Benjamin Disraeli.The delight lies in how certain facts may be obscure to some and immediately clear to others, or how even the same information may be held and organised in different ways by different minds. Once, at a tournament, I buzzed after three words – “President Cheddi Jagan” – and, in wild surmise that the question would ask for a country, ventured: “Guyana”.I was right, but there was no reason for me to have known that – except that, years ago, I’d seen Jagan in a cheesy Unesco advertisement that played throughout the breaks of an India-West Indies cricket broadcast. He appeared above his name and title, offering such a cheesy thumbs-up that I’ve never forgotten him. In the same game, I came up empty while trying to remember the name of the Deccan Plateau – the triangular chunk of southern India, where I lived for much of my childhood. There is nothing to be done about the caprices of memory – but somehow, that makes quizzing more exciting, not less. And it sweetens the sudden, climactic illumination: the microsecond when the brain, acting almost outside your will, pulls the clues together to recognise the answer, as cleanly as if you had known it all along. The quest for that moment is the source of the addiction.There are so many different formats of quizzing that no one can be described as the world’s best quizzer. But Pat Gibson can certainly stake a claim. He’s won the World Quizzing Championship four times. In 2004, he won a phlegmatic million on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in 2006, he won Brain of Britain, the BBC Radio 4 quiz. Today his diet involves three quiz leagues in which his team takes part. “Serious quizzing,” Gibson said approvingly, describing the leagues to me when we met in November. Additionally, five or six weeks a year, he takes the train from Wigan, where he lives, to Glasgow, to appear as an Egghead on the BBC show of that name. The format often requires a challenger to take Gibson on solo. You have to feel for the challenger.Gibson, 58, didn’t properly start quizzing until he was in his early 30s. Growing up in Ireland, he devoured atlases and maps, but he only ever went to one major quiz: the Brain of Ireland, where, as a teenager, he got stage fright and didn’t say a word. After moving to England, he worked as a software engineer, and in the 90s, a colleague roped him into a quiz league. He got so good that, a decade later, he decided to do it more seriously.Gibson has built himself software into which he keys facts that he comes across on some days, he will add as many as 100 facts to his database, culled from books, TV or his perusal of The Times over breakfast. If he is driving and he hears something compelling on the radio, he will pull over and scribble it down in the notebook he always carries with him. He sets time aside for revision. He may decide, next week, that it’s been too long since he brushed up on the Vietnam war, so he will call up the file and study it. He has built files on all sorts of subjects. Sometimes he wonders if he could acquire an appreciation of, say, Ibsen’s plays purely via his Ibsen file, without watching or reading any of the plays themselves.Frequently, Gibson talks about questions as if he were Genghis Khan surveying central Asia: “All those inidual little fortresses, each one begging to be conquered,” he says, practically licking his lips in anticipation. People often assume that his only weapon is his tenacious memory. “Well, yes, remembering is obviously important,” he says, “but it isn’t decisive.” Even after mastering a database, there is no way to know every possible question-answer pair cold nearly always, a quizzer is making a reasoned guess, even when they are certain that their answer is correct. What Gibson values far more than memory is his capacity to submerge himself in a topic. “If you answered a question about Alexander the Great, it’s because you were interested in Alexander the Great, and you read about Alexander the Great,” he said. “Curiosity – there’s a big payoff for curiosity.”Within the philosophy of quizzing, it isn’t easy to define what precisely makes a fact worth retaining. It has to have the ring of novelty, or the tilt of oddity, or the gloss of some human achievement it has to sit at an angle to all the rest of the information that continually laps at our feet. “The number of eggs produced every year in Cambridgeshire – that isn’t interesting to a quizzer,” Gibson says. Unless the number is zero, it isn’t distinctive other counties produce eggs, too, and the statistic says nothing intriguing about Cambridgeshire. On the other hand, on the morning of the day we met, Gibson had prospected a nugget out of the newspaper: that the actor Eddie Marsan has situs inversus, a condition in which the positions of major internal organs are flipped into the opposite side of the body. That only seemed to beguile Gibson into further inquiry. How common is situs inversus? How does the human frame handle this inversion? Who else has situs inversus? The fact went straight into Gibson’s database.Every quizzer practises some such form of information triage. (On my phone, a Notes file is dedicated to gobbets of fact that I’ve come across and want to pursue. The latest entry: “The names of hydrogen and oxygen – Greek for ‘water-former’ and ‘acid-former’ respectively – should actually be reversed. It’s hydrogen that forms acids and oxygen that forms water.”) This habit can make quizzing out to be a kind of intellectual escapism – a constant flight from the big, boring everyday into the eccentric or the significant. But it is, in fact, the opposite. Quizzing invites us to pay extra attention, not only to what we read or watch but also to what is around us. For all its flaws, Slumdog Millionaire got that part about quizzing right. In the movie, Jamal Malik, a young man from Mumbai’s slums, goes on a hot streak on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, prompting suspicion in everyone. How would a kid like this, with his narrow, limited existence, know the statesman whose portrait appears on a $100 bill or the city in which Cambridge Circus lies? But he had been tipped $100 by an American tourist while working as a phoney tour guide at the Taj Mahal, and he had served tea in a call centre where the clusters of cubicles and their aisles were named after British cities and their streets. That’s how he knew.In less dramatic, Oscar-winning ways, that has happened to every quizzer: an answer pried out of some ancient circumstance, like Cheddi Jagan from a Unesco advertisement. In psychology, episodic memory is distinguished from semantic memory. The first recollects autobiographical events – past birthdays, a first kiss, a car accident – while the second stores facts, like names of cities or Ballon d’Or winners or chemical element symbols. In our minds, during a quiz, these categories don’t feel nearly as separate every slice of episodic memory seems to be embedded with facts that we can pick out, like plums in a pie. During one of his Mastermind runs, Gibson got a question about the USS Pueblo, a spy ship once captured by North Korea. “It was like a Proustian moment,” he said. “In a flash, I was back to being a boy, sitting on the floor of our house in Letterkenny, reading a Reader’s Digest article on the Pueblo.” Even our most secondhand knowledge is tied intimately to our first-hand experiences. If you stay alert and inquisitive, the best preparation for quizzing can be life itself.My time in quizzing has overlapped tidily with the web’s renovation of the sport. Mainly, its effect has been to vastly expand the realm of subjects that might feature in quiz questions. In the US, the more academic style of Quiz Bowl was supplemented in the late 1990s by Trash tournaments, which quizzed students on video games, comic books, pop music and decidedly non-classic TV and cinema. The web held reservoirs of detail about these topics that made it possible to frame sound questions about them in an earlier era, setting a Trash question pack by relying on the library would have been a punishing task.European quizzes grew more capacious as well. “I’ve looked in old quiz books, and the questions are dreadful, frankly,” Jack Waley-Cohen, one of the question editors for the BBC show Only Connect, told me. “There was an assumption that everybody knew the same things.” Now, quizmasters don’t ever ask who the chancellor of the exchequer was in 1973, he said. “For one, someone who is an expert in television or music has an opportunity to demonstrate it, because there are questions on that. But also, the questions I like don’t test absolute knowledge. They test lateral thinking, and your ability to access knowledge.”The greatest internet-driven transformation has occurred in Indian quizzing, where questions have bloomed into intricate puzzles, strewing clues through wordplay, snippets of video, clips of audio, and photos. My morsel about the mint julep would never make the cut today: it’s too dry, too plain. Questions are longer and denser now, and devised to be unlocked in multiple ways, as in the blanc-black case. Logic and teamwork are indispensable. In these quizzes, one may even lavish the compliment “Good answer!” – not for the right response, mind, but for a guess that makes inventive use of the facts provided. The creativity of this style of quizzing, I’m convinced, is also a reaction to the stodginess that infects Indian education. Studying in India involves scant imagination and heavy doses of rote learning examinations admit no such notion as a “good answer”, merely correct and incorrect ones. Just as the internet offered its bottomless resources to those with wide, various interests, quizzing became a canvas to express these interests.The more perplexing issue is that of gender. The subculture tends to be overwhelmingly male – a problem that has been visible wherever I have quizzed, from Ireland to India. Local patterns of sexism might account for some of it. But the universality of this imbalance suggests that the old, male domination of systems of knowledge – even informal ones – is still solid and immovable, like a boulder across a road. As a result, quizzing lays itself open to the accusation that it doesn’t try hard enough to be inclusive, and that it is content largely to be a space into which men can escape to hang out with other men – like poker nights, but for nerds who happen to know why a two-pair of black eights and aces is called a Dead Man’s Hand. (When Wild Bill Hickok, the American frontiersman, was shot in the head during a poker game in a South Dakota saloon in 1876, these were supposedly the cards he held.) For all the quick intelligence that quizzing demands, it can also be slow and witless in avoiding the worst traits of the culture it inhabits.This is unfortunate, because quizzing really is, in principle, among the most equitable of sports. A well-set quiz will not cater exclusively to any inborn prowess. Instead, by being wide-ranging and original, it takes as its premise a powerful truth: no one knows everything, and everyone in the room knows something that the others don’t. Each fresh question is played on a newly levelled field, offering the distinct possibility that the newcomer may beat the veteran to the answer. The guy on the couch never watches Ben Stokes get bowled in a Test match with the certainty that he could have done better. But he might well watch an Oxford team on University Challenge fumble an answer that he knows and be sure that, within that pocket of erudition, he has proven a winner.These inidual triumphs can come about because no two lives experience the world in identical ways. There is something beautifully human about that, just as there is something beautifully human about the very act of remembering – especially now, when we are fast ceding our intelligence to our machines. We don’t always need to remember facts any more, given that we can look them up or store them more and more, we relieve our minds of this duty. But that’s precisely why, in a quiz, it’s gratifying to excavate answers from our memories, as if to prove to ourselves that we are still capable of it. And it feels pure and liberating that this is knowledge stripped of any practical purpose. It has lodged in our neurons not because it has been programmed in to serve a function, as with computers, but because the human brain is an insatiable, indiscriminating sponge.For the moment, too, it appears as if we have this caper of the intellect just to ourselves. The machines are already defeating us at chess and Go, solving mathematical problems, and identifying fake works of art. But as of now, they can only hoard deep reserves of facts, producing one of them when queried specifically for it. They only know what they can store they don’t yet have a way to go from not knowing to knowing, the way we do so unconsciously in quizzing. It is true that, in 2013, an IBM supercomputer named Watson trounced two former champions on US quiz show Jeopardy! But it turned out to be a perverse badge of pride for our species that IBM spent billions of dollars on the machine, deployed it in a quiz show where buzzer reflexes matter as much as answers, and had to discard its brute, fact-crunching approach for an algorithm that sifted hypotheses, appraised language, processed allusions, and made associations. Thinking like a human, it turned out, is still something that humans do better than machines.No other quizzing computers have come forth since. Which isn’t to say that they won’t ever in fact, we may turn into such devices ourselves, if we elect to install the kind of brain-machine interfaces that Elon Musk and others want to develop. I suppose this will be like having a Google search bar in each of our heads, the cursor blinking, ready to ransack every viable bank of information. Maybe the power to know absolutely everything will result in some elevated, as yet unimaginable form of quizzing, but I have my doubts. Quizzing depends too much on not knowing. I don’t mean this in the hard-nosed, free-market sense that only deficits of knowledge can determine winners and losers, or as airy solace that our limitations make us beautiful. I mean that the purpose of quizzing is to discover the answers, to work with meagreness, to build sufficiency out of insufficiency. It is to fashion your own lamp and guide yourself to the truth that black and blanc are shoots with the same root. In this manner, the world comes slowly into focus, question by question.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62715af08e759dbe4679df42b88cacd710a255b7/0_0_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52a3442036f26f73451c9555bab2a0e5","title":"how isabel dos santos became africa richest woman podcast","story":"Dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of the former president of Angola, claims to be a self-made businesswoman, but the Luanda Leaks, a cache of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits and accounts, help explain how she actually built her business empire.

We can start doing this by updating those parts of our constitution that are now 25 years out of date,” he said.“I will always publicly advocate and promote internal policies that seek to bring water, energy, rail and mail back into public hands whether it be from within the shadow cabinet or in a Labour government.“Public ownership is popular, and we need to stay in tune with voters who are sick of being ripped off by private companies which treat public services as nothing more than cash cows.”Burgon won the backing of the Unite trade union last week, despite their pick for the leadership, Rebecca Long-Bailey, supporting the deputy frontrunner, Angela Rayner.In order to make it on to the ballot paper alongside Rayner, he will need the support of two more affiliated organisations, including at least one union.Other contenders include Dawn Butler, Ian Murray and Rosena Allin-Khan, but all appear to be struggling to secure the backing from either trade unions or constituency parties required to book their place in the final vote.Corbyn has insisted that Labour “won the argument” during the general election campaign, and suggested Brexit was largely responsible for the party’s poor performance.His allies are keen to ensure the party’s shift to the left under his leadership is not reversed under his successor.Burgon said: “Before Jeremy’s leadership, the constant timidity to back what the public knew to be the obvious common sense solution of public ownership was driven by years of internal kowtowing to neoliberalism. There must never be a return to this dead end.“If I win, I’ll fight to ensure that the leadership of our party never again refuses to argue for public ownership.”The post of deputy leader was vacated by Tom Watson, who announced as the election campaign kicked off that he would not stand again in his West Bromwich East seat.As with the leadership contest, the result of the ballot for deputy leader will be announced on 4 April."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b31136ce998a49f288e41848af6585f1a0e7357c/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77932bb35b0fe9163ffbbf85ebb3272b","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youMore than 1,280 infected and 18 cities in lockdown in China as officials try to stem spread of virus which has reached Europe, the US and Australia.

There have been warnings from inside China that people may be infectious before they start to feel ill.So far there has been very limited spread from China. A handful of countries have reported cases including France, which has three, and the United States, which has five. This is the first reported European case of transmission from one person to another but it has also occurred in Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan.The World Health Organization said on Tuesday that China had agreed the WHO could send international experts “as soon as possible” after talks in Beijing. It said a better understanding of the virus’ ability to spread from person to person was urgently needed to advise other countries and guide the global response to the outbreak.Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, said the country was battling a “demon” virus during talks earlier on Tuesday with the UN agency’s head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials.The vast majority of more than 4,000 cases, however, and all 106 deaths, have been in China and principally in Wuhan, the city where the coronavirus emerged and caused a mass outbreak of viral pneumonia.Many governments have brought in screening or other controls at airports for arrivals from China. Countries that have said they will repatriate their citizens in Wuhan – including France, Japan and the United States – are making arrangements to isolate them once back on home soil. Hong Kong has announced major cuts to its transport links with mainland China.The 33 year-old man who has been infected had not visited China, but a Chinese colleague who visited Germany last week had “started to feel sick on the flight home on January 23”, said Andreas Zapf, head of the Bavarian State Office for Health and Food Safety.The Chinese colleague, a woman, gave a training session on 21 January at the office of the car parts supplier Webasto in Stockdorf in Bavaria. The man who had attended the session tested positive for the virus on Monday evening. He remains in hospital in an isolation ward, but Zapf said he “was doing well”.The Chinese woman sought medical attention when she returned from China and was found to have the virus. She is said to have recently visited her parents in Wuhan. In a statement, the Webasto company said it had halted all business travel to and from China “for at least the next two weeks”.The World Health Organisation is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Health officials are checking 40 people who had been in contact with the two infected workers, recently, including colleagues and family members.The European Centre for Disease Control said in a statement that the Bavarian case had not changed its assessment of the risk but it expected more similar cases. “At this stage of the ongoing outbreak in the Hubei province in China, it is likely that there will be more imported cases in Europe. As a consequence, it could be expected to see limited local transmission in Europe.“A single detected case in Europe does not change the overall picture for Europe, nor does it change the assessment that there is currently a moderate likelihood of importation of cases.”Experts said human-to-human transmission outside China was unsurprising but the German case is concerning largely because the virus appears to have been transmitted by somebody without symptoms, said Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia.“The Vietnamese case was reported by WHO and he was in contact with his sick father who had returned from China. The Japanese cases was a tour bus driver who had driven around two groups of Chinese tourists and the German cases had attended a work-based training event also attended by a woman who only became ill two days later during her return to China two days later. The German case is most worrying because if the Chinese woman was indeed asymptomatic at the time of the training session it would confirm reports of spread before symptoms develop making standard control strategies less effective,” he said.Symptoms include a sore throat, fever and breathing difficulties. People are warned to protect themselves by hand-washing, because it can be transmitted in skin-to-skin contact, and to cover their nose and mouth if coughing or sneezing. In the UK, the advice is for anyone who thinks they may have been in contact with somebody carrying the virus to stay at home by themselves and call 111 for advice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba7729b696e84e1bc4972f1e60589e06d87bd180/0_74_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86afefd256def85a3455a942c107c0e6","title":"israel folau switches codes again to sign for catalans dragons rugby league","story":"There is anger and frustration across rugby league after the sport’s governing body, the Rugby Football League, sanctioned Catalans Dragons’ move for the controversial Australian Israel Folau on a one-year deal. The French club say they want to give Folau, who has not played either code of rugby since being sacked by Rugby Australia last year following homophobic comments on social media, a “new opportunity to shine”.Yet many across a sport which prides itself on inclusivity are furious that Folau has been allowed to return to rugby league. The RFL had no obligation to run the issue past clubs, but given the sensitive nature of Folau’s return to the sport, many are disappointed they were not at least briefed.  understands that Super League clubs were told about the news just minutes before Catalans’ official announcement.Wigan Warriors immediately responded by saying their game against Catalans on 22 March would be named Pride Day as the club look to support the LGBTQ+ community. Many clubs declined to comment, instead opting to take stock in the immediate aftermath of the news. However, Wakefield Trinity’s chief executive, Michael Carter, whose club will host Catalans when they play their first match in England, said: “Personally, I do not think his signing should have been entertained whatsoever. There are many moral arguments saying he should be banned from every other sport, and I worry if Super League is now becoming a catch-all safety net for people who aren’t welcome elsewhere. His views are abhorrent in a modern world. His registration should have been refused – that is our club’s position on it. We have no time for the views he shares.”This deep-rooted concern is echoed by many within rugby league, who fear the arrival of Folau could cause significant PR damage for the sport. Australia’s National Rugby League (NRL) made it abundantly clear in the wake of Folau’s dismissal by Rugby Australia that he would not be registered in their competition moving forward – but the RFL instead have opted not to block the signature.“This is a difficult decision, as the RFL places a high value on the sport’s reputation in prioritising Inclusion and Diversity – and deplores the player’s previous comments,” it said in a statement. “However, the moral responsibility for deciding whether to sign a player sits with inidual clubs. The player has not been charged or found guilty of any criminal offence. However distasteful his previous comments, we don’t believe that, under our current regulatory framework, these can prevent his participation in the sport.”The Super League chief executive, Robert Elstone, insisted there was nothing the competition could do once the RFL had made its decision. “I have sought the opinion of informed voices connected to our game, and the majority share my disappointment that one of our clubs has chosen to sign him,” Elstone said. “There is a strong feeling that the decision to sign him lets down many people connected to our sport. I made Catalans Dragons aware of those views. However, Super League does not have the authority to veto the registration of players and is satisfied by the due diligence carried out by the RFL.”The Halifax prop, Keegan Hirst, who is the only current out gay rugby league player in Britain, wrote on Twitter: “I’m shocked and disappointed at the signing of @IzzyFolau. Our great game is tasked with fighting against homophobia and standing up for the values it puts such high stock in. It shows none of the bravery, cameraderie or integrity @rfl expects from its players, staff and fans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f2a5a300eb639c7e1f441f6d629d579553f9ee/0_109_3406_2043/master/3406.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6624a9ca986872a3528fd6706a1e3f9b","title":"share your views on sports banter in the workplace","story":"Do you feel sports banter in the office excludes people?

What we’re going to do is almost talent-hunt, really – see what’s out there, speak to all the local clubs, and give them every opportunity to make it, because if we don’t have role models coming from the community it’s not going to happen.”The ACE programme will start with two free open days – more may be scheduled if there is sufficient demand – during which coaches hope to identify six 11- to 14-year-olds and six 15- to 18-year-olds, of any gender, who will be offered scholarships entitling them to coaching, education, and grants for equipment and travel. Alongside this Surrey will offer community education and funding for grassroots clubs in the black community.Rainford-Brent’s own cricketing journey started in very similar circumstances to those she now hopes to create for others, at a one-off session offered by the charity Cricket for Change – which rebranded with a broadened focus as the Change Foundation in 2015. “The key was the opportunity,” she says. “If I never hit that ball on that day, and had just said, ‘No, I’ll try something else’, I wouldn’t have found a whole new path.

I care because it’s my future.”Many young millennials and Generation Z are passionate about tackling the climate crisis, research shows. They also want to work at organisations that have a strong commitment to sustainability.Across the UK, young people like Dharni are working to create a healthier planet. For example, Sadie DeCoste, 23, is an analyst at E Co, a London-based consultancy, which works on low-carbon, climate-resilient projects. DeCoste says she’s always been interested in sustainability. “I’ve been really passionate about it since high school,” she says. “I find it meaningful and interesting.”Dharni and DeCoste both point out that young people have grown up in the internet age, seeing the impact of the climate crisis around them. “People our age care because we’re more educated on the subject,” DeCoste says. A recent report warned that 100 million more people could be driven into poverty by climate change impacts on natural disasters and agriculture by 2030 unless precautions are taken now.For this reason, many young people want to make a difference through their work. “If you’re going to spend such a big part of your life working, why wouldn’t you try to maximise your impact?” DeCoste says.McConnochie believes there’s only so much he can do as an inidual and wants to achieve more than that. “I’m a realist, I believe that as an inidual there’s only so much of an effect you can have. So taking up this role has allowed me to have the most influence outside of my personal actions. I’m able to work with some of the biggest housing associations and to start seeing some real significant change within them.”Other young people are founding their own companies or working at startups that offer alternative ways of doing things. Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, 22, works at Olio, a startup that connects neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, rather than thrown away. “I started at Olio in April and it’s been a wild ride,” she says. “I’m having my mind stretched by all these problems and solutions. I’ve been so busy – it keeps you on your toes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f09f3602a5f9b8eb73c305732918558cb4082/0_150_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db76026bc3c7a2c73e18134711fafc57 720w","title":"doctor who jo martin becomes first bame actor to play the doctor","story":"The surprise introduction of the first Doctor of colour thrills fans – but raises questions about exactly where she fits into the WhoniverseAfter 56 years on our screens, Doctor Who made history on the weekend by casting the first BAME actor in the lead role, with Fugitive of the Judoon introducing Jo Martin as the Doctor.Martin is a regular on Holby City, where she plays Max McGerry, consultant neurosurgeon and acting CEO of the hospital. She has also appeared in Fleabag, Batman Begins and first came to prominence in the early 2000s playing Natalie Crouch in the BBC One sitcom The Crouches. She posted a picture of herself in costume as the Doctor on social media after the show aired on Sunday night – having kept her new role secret for months. Reaction to her arrival was spontaneous and joyous – the production team had managed to keep the surprise entirely under wraps.And after just one appearance, Martin’s incarnation of the Time Lord has already begun to inspire fan art.The casting, though, isn’t as straightforward as announcing her as the new Doctor to succeed current Doctor Jodie Whittaker. Her character was revealed to be a previously unknown version of the Doctor hiding on Earth disguised as a human tour guide called Ruth Clayton. Pursued by the Judoon as a fugitive, Clayton and Whittaker’s Doctor travelled to a remote lighthouse to discover Martin’s Tardis buried underground as her memory was restored.Fans have since posited several theories of how Jo Martin’s Doctor could fit into the show’s established history:In a Tardis scene where the two Doctors sparred with each other over their costumes, neither Whittaker nor Martin claimed to recognise the other – raising the possibility that Martin’s Doctor comes from an alternative dimension. This season’s opening story Spyfall set up the idea that there were possibly multiple versions of Earth being invaded by an alien species called the Kasavin, and at one point Whittaker’s Doctor appeared to be transported to their dimension. Perhaps she didn’t make it back to the right universe?There’s a gap in on-screen continuity between the Second and Third Doctors. In his last regular appearance in the role, Patrick Troughton was forced to change his face as a punishment by the Time Lords. In the next episode, we see Jon Pertwee’s Doctor fall unconscious out of the Tardis. Crucially, though, we never see Troughton actually morph into Pertwee. It is possible that Martin’s Doctor fits in here – although the fact that she didn’t recognise the sonic screwdriver, as first used by Troughton’s Doctor, suggests otherwise.There are rumours that there may be a whole host of Doctors we’ve never encountered before, who lived before the William Hartnell Doctor. The theory goes that some cataclysmic development had wiped his memory, leading him to forget his earlier selves, and to live believing he had never regenerated before.The clues are there. Martin’s Doctor referred to the Tardis as “the ship”, as only Hartnell used to, and the design of her Tardis is very similar to the iconic version that was first seen on screen in 1963.The show has previous in terms of introducing unknown past versions of the Doctor. John Hurt memorably guest-starred in the 50th anniversary special as a grizzled elderly version of the character who had rejected the name “Doctor”.Other fan theories have suggested that she can’t be the Doctor at all – Martin’s character has just found a way to disguise herself, thereby fooling Whittaker’s Doctor into thinking they are the same Time Lord. Several villains from the past might be able to achieve that – the Master, possibly, or the Rani, who hasn’t appeared in Doctor Who since 1993.This could even signal the return of the Valeyard – a twisted evil version of the Doctor who appeared as Colin Baker’s main adversary in the 1986 story Trial of a Time Lord. Fans have long yearned to find out the fate of this amalgam of all the Doctor’s negative traits who was said to be somewhere between the Doctor’s twelfth and thirteenth incarnations.But showrunner Chris Chibnall has said there are no tricks. “Jo Martin is the Doctor, that’s why we gave her the credit at the end which all new Doctors have the first time you see them. John Hurt got that credit.”Plenty of significant characters in Who history – the Doctor’s daughter Jenny, granddaughter Susan, Clara and Maisie Williams’ immortal MeAshildr – have waltzed off the show, leaving us wondering what happened to them, and never appeared again. Chibnall appears to have ruled out John Barrowman returning as Captain Jack again this series after his cameo at the weekend, and has hinted that this year’s season finale might not tie up all the themes of the story arc just yet, saying: “There will be answers to some of these mysteries this series. But as ever with Doctor Who, answers often reveal new questions.”Doctor Who continues on BBC One on Sunday with the episode Praxeus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382c12c7a9a833a556d465ca42bf04b614aa3d92/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42f570dd8f8ac1a5c312a931145daad6","title":"syrian regime captures maarat al numan in idlib","story":"Soldiers take Maarat al-Numan in Idlib under the cover of heavy airstrikes, state media saysBashar al-Assad has recaptured a significant town in Syria’s last rebel-held territory, in an offensive that has driven tens of thousands of people towards the border with Turkey.Government soldiers entered Maarat al-Numan in northwest Idlib province on Tuesday under the cover of heavy airstrikes, a war monitor and government media said.The town sits on the M5 highway, one of the country’s economic arteries, making it a strategic prize. Maarat al-Numan also has symbolic importance as one of the major centres for protest against Assad’s rule since the Syrian uprising began in 2011.It has been bombed by Assad and his Russian allies for months, emptying the town of its 110,000 residents. In recent days Assad’s troops have surged forward, capturing more than a dozen villages in the area and encircling the town on three sides.“Maarat al-Numan is completely destroyed and its population has been displaced and is living in uncertainty,” a rescue worker in the town said in a video posted to social media, which showed how barrel bombs, missiles and shelling destroyed scores of homes and buildings.Further north, government forces began an offensive on the western suburbs of Aleppo in an attempt to push insurgents away from Syria’s largest city. Rebels have rained artillery and mortar shells down on Aleppo in recent days.The UN and aid agencies have repeatedly warned that fighting in Idlib risks a major humanitarian catastrophe: its population has grown from one million people to approximately three million as Assad has clawed back territory from rebels over the nine-year conflict.Turkey, which backs some of Idlib’s rebel groups, has attempted to broker several ceasefires. The most recent agreement with Moscow on 12 January failed to materialise: more than 120,000 people across Idlib have been displaced by the regime offensive since 15 January, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The number of people displaced in the past nine months is around 750,000. Hundreds of thousands are camped out on the Turkish border without adequate food, medicine or shelter in the winter conditions.The push into Maarat al-Numan on Tuesday came hours before the UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, was scheduled to arrive inDamascus to meet officials.Damascus and Moscow renewed efforts to recapture Idlib after Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a former al-Qaida offshoot, emerged as the dominant militant group in the area last year. Since then at least 68 medical facilities have been bombed, according to the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, as well as schools and marketplaces.While the regime has dropped leaflets on Idlib telling civilians to avoid shelling and airstrikes by moving southwards to reconcile with government forces, many are afraid that to do so risks arrest, imprisonment and torture in Assad’s jails.Turkey, already home to around four million Syrians, is unwilling to open its border to more refugees.On Tuesday, the Turkish defence ministry said in a statement it would retaliate “in self-defence” if any of its military posts in Idlib, installed to create a de-escalation zone, were threatened by the new push.President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Donald Trump discussed the situation in a phone call on Monday night and “agreed that the violence must stop,” the White House said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4154332.1580236522!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"political parties rule out student loans to fund third level","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister of State Mary Mitchell O’Connor, TD Fine Gael, Deputy Thomas Byrne (FF) Senator Ivana Bacik (Labour), Deputy Donnchadh O’Laoghaire (SF) Cllr Neasa Hourigan, (GP) Deputy  Richard Boyd Barrett (PBP)and Aengus O’Maolain, (Social Democrats), at the election debate on the future funding of higher education and research in Ireland  at the TCD Business School, in Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The All major political parties have ruled out a student loan scheme as a way of funding higher education over the coming years.The comments were made at a debate on the future of higher education involving the spokespeople for the main political parties at Trinity College Dublin on Wednesday moderated by Newstalk’s Shane Coleman. Minister of State for higher education and Fine Gael TD Mary Mitchell O’Connor said student registration charges - currently €3,000 a year - will be frozen and additional public funding will be invested in the sector if her party is returned to government.When pressed on whether the sector was underfunded, she conceded that the sector still requires “extra funding”, and this would be drawn from the exchequer and a levy on employers, known as the National Training Fund.Fianna Fáil’s education spokesman Thomas Byrne TD also pledged free registration charges and promised to invest an additional €100 million in funding for the sector.Richard Boyd Barrett TD of People Before Profit said he supported a fully publicly-funded system of higher education which is free for all.Instead, he said, governments have made college less affordable by “slashing funding, cutting grants and increasing registration fees”.“State grants aid for horses? €6,915 per year. State grant aid per student? €4,396 per year. That’s how seriously successive governments take you as students and higher education,” he said.Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire TD also ruled out a loan scheme and said the last four years have been “time lost” for higher education.He said the party supported a fully publicly-funded higher education system along with additional investment in grants to make going to college more affordable.Abolish registration feeLabour Senator Ivana Bacik said her party’s preference is for a fully publicly-funded higher education system and for the €3,000 student registration charge to be abolished.She said she felt this could be implemented over the lifetime of the next government, and pointed to Labour’s move to abolish third level fees in 1996 as a sign that it was possible with “political will”.Ms Bacik also warned that the current approach to providing targeted additional funding in selected programmes or skills areas could lead to the “destruction of arts and humanities by stealth” and pledged to end this policy.Cllr Nessa Hourigan of the Green Party said a key priority would be boosting access to higher education for under-represented groups as well as improving terms and conditions for third level staff on precarious contracts.The Social Democrats, according to party representative Aengus Ó Maoláin, warned that the current approach to third level funding was a “recipe for disaster” and also supported a public-funded system.In the meantime, he said the party would support a cut in the student registration charge and making college more affordable for all.At the beginning of the debate, Trinity provost Patrick Prendergast has warned that under-funding of the sector was a “time-bomb” that needed to be addressed.“We are sitting on a time bomb . . . The country depends on cutting edge research. Our universities are being overtaken in the global ranking by institutions around the world with better public funding,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4153308.1580200203!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plans to evacuate irish citizens from china","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedical workers in protective gear talk with a woman suspected of being ill with  the coronavirus at a health station in Wuhan, central China’s Hubei Province, on Monday.  Photograph: Chinatopix via APPreparations are under way to evacuate Irish citizens trapped in the Chinese region at the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.As the death toll in China reached 82, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it was exploring options, “including commercial options”, for assisting Irish citizens to leave Hubei province, “if required”.However, the offer poses a dilemma for those in the stricken city as their Chinese partners would be left behind and anyone leaving would face another period under quarantine once they got out of the affected area.“The Embassy is in contact with Irish citizens in Hubei province regarding their intentions,” a spokeswoman told The . It is estimated there are eight Irish citizens in the affected region, which has been in effective lockdown since the Chinese authorities imposed severe transport restrictions in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.On Monday, the mayor of Wuhan, in Hubei, acknowledged criticism of his handling of the crisis, and offered to resign. There is growing anger among residents that they were not informed earlier about the risk posed by the outbreak, which is thought to have begun in December.The number of confirmed cases has reached almost 3,000, with 400 of these critical. The number of suspected cases now stands at more than 5,700, but experts believe thousands more could eventually be infected.Stocks markets tumbled worldwide yesterday following concerns about the possible economic impact of the coronavirus.ConcernMembers of the Chinese community in Ireland have expressed concern about the presence here of a tour party from the region of the country where the coronavirus originated.The group left China before restrictions were imposed on travel there, came to Britain and then travelled on to Ireland on the ferry from Holyhead at the weekend. Chinese social media posts show a woman member of the group posing at various landmarks, including Trinity College in Dublin and the Titanic Centre in Belfast. “We are the only tour from Wubei that can travel in UK. That’s not easy,” the woman posted on Weibo, a social media site. She also posted a picture from the Holyhead ferry, on which members of her group had played poker.While there is no evidence the group posed any health threat, its presence in Ireland prompted criticism on Chinese social media. One poster warned the community in Ireland, and in particularly Chinese restaurants, to “be aware” of their presence.Surgical masksMedical suppliers are reporting a big jump in demand for surgical masks in response to the coronavirus outbreak in China, with some Dublin stores saying they have run out of stocks.Demand has been particularly high among the Chinese community, especially from those who travelled home to mark the Chinese New Year at the weekend.The Department of Health said its National Public Health Emergency Team met on Monday to review the ongoing preparedness of the Irish health system for any cases of the virus that occur in Ireland. A statement gave no details of the group’s deliberations but pointed out that no confirmed cases had occurred here.Waterford Institute of Technology said one of its students was in self-isolation after travelling from Wuhan at the weekend.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe .Until now Fine Gael Senator Catherine Noone was probably best known for her role as chairwoman of the Oireachtas committee on the Eighth Amendment, which paved the way for the referendum legalising abortion.Her position on the issue moved from being anti-abortion to pro-choice.It was not her first brush with controversy. It emerged last month that Ms Noone was the biggest user in the Fine Gael ranks of the Oireachtas free printing service, requesting almost €9,000 worth of material last year.Earlier that month she proposed a having “positivity seminar” to focus on selecting more uplifting messages for Fine Gael to send out after party members discussed low morale at a parliamentary party meeting.‘Jumped the gun’In 2015, Ms Noone did a U-turn after calling for a ban on mixed martial arts (MMA) after a Twitter storm over remarks in which she described it as “ultra-violent”. She said she had “jumped the gun” and that her comments had been ill-informed and she later called for MMA to be recognised by the Irish Sports Council, saying she was a “big fan”.Ms Noone told the Seanad last October about receiving a death threat on social media after posting “a positive tweet about the Taoiseach’s polling”.She said she received “over 100 of the most negative comments” including one that said: “Do you remember what happened to (murdered UK) MP Jo Cox? You should be buried alive with the rest of your parasitic colleagues.”A native of Claremorris in Co Mayo, Ms Noone is the daughter of a psychiatrist and veterinary surgeon. She studied law at NUI Galway before training as a solicitor.Her first venture into electoral politics was in 2009 when she won a seat on Dublin City Council in the south east inner city ward. Two years later she was elected to the Seanad on the Industrial and Commercial panel. Noel Rock, who later became a Dublin North West TD, served as her parliamentary assistant.Running mateShe stood as Mr Varadkar’s running mate in Dublin West in the 2016 general election. She polled just over 1,000 votes as Fine Gael chased an unwinnable second seat in the four-seater constituency. However, she successfully ran to retain her seat in the Seanad.Ms Noone has now switched constituencies to Dublin Bay North, where she is running alongside perennial poll topper Richard Bruton, the Minister for Communications. As part of a vote management strategy, he has assigned Ms Noone middle-class areas including Sutton and Howth to canvass in.Previously a Dublin city resident, her address is listed on the ballot paper as Howth. Unpublished polls have put her at 6 per cent to 8 per cent, which on a good day for Fine Gael and with careful vote management would give her an outside chance of a seat.

I am truly sorry’. File  photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said the fact that Fine Gael Dublin Bay North election candidate Catherine Noone has apologised and withdrawn a remark about him being “autistic” is good enough.“She has withdrawn her remarks and apologised and, you know, that’s good enough for me,” he told RTÉ in Galway where he was campaigning on Tuesday.“Well, you know, it’s not about me. I just think that we all need to be very aware. I’m very respectful of people who have autism, people who are on the autism spectrum and we need to understand that those terms should never be used in a pejorative way at all.Ms Noone, who was elected to the Seanad after failing to win a Dáil seat in 2016, apologised on Tuesday for calling Mr Varadkar “autistic” during an election canvass this week.She was quoted in The Times Ireland edition as having said of Mr Varadkar: “He’s autistic like, he’s on the spectrum, there’s no doubt about it. He’s uncomfortable socially and he doesn’t always get the in-between bits”.The publisher reported that she had initially denied having made the comments, before being told there was a tape of her saying them. In a statement, she said she wanted to “unequivocally apologise and withdraw all of my remarks...which were completely unacceptable”. She said her “choice of language was inexcusable and wrong. I am truly sorry”. No further commentMs Noone, who is Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton’s running mate, said she would not be making any further comment. The autism awareness group AsIAm urged people not to engage in “doorstep diagnosis” of autism following her comments.Fiona Ferris, the deputy chief executive of the advocacy and support organisation, said the apology from Ms Noone was not enough. Ms Ferris described the comments as “quite shocking” and it was “completely unacceptable” to the autistic community for the word to be used as “a descriptor” or an adjective.Autism diagnoses only comes after an extensive clinical process, she told RTÉ radio’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show, adding that autism should not be used to describe someone.Ms Ferris said she did not accept the apology and that Ms Noone should “fully educate herself on what autism is”. Autism is not an illness it is a condition, she explained, and it was of great concern that a political representative thought it was acceptable to use the word as a descriptor. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Tara Matthews, deputy executive director of the Irish Society for Autism, said off the cuff and thoughtless remarks can be very hurtful and increase the stress and isolation that some iniduals with autism and their families experience. “When dealing with autism it is imperative to respect the dignity of iniduals with the condition and their families,” she said. “These recent comments further enhance the need for an Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill to promote awareness, and education, improved autism services and a comprehensive strategy for the future.”ReactionReacting to Ms Noone comments, Minister of Health Simon Harris tweeted: “Autism should never be used as a slur or a negative. 1 in 65 people can be on the Autistic Spectrum - including someone I know and love dearly. As a society we need to become much more aware in relation to Autism and not use casual stereotypes.”Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath also criticised the comments. “They were ill-informed and extremely damaging to a section of Irish society”, said Mr McGrath. “People with autism are a part of Irish society and should always be treated as equals in line with the UN Convention for the Rights of Persons with a Disability.“... I accept Ms Noone’s apology but we will need to focus on our new Autism Plan which will deliver an awareness raising campaign, a national training programme for clinicians and improvements to the assessment process.”During the debate, Mr Varadkar responded to criticism from some quarters that he sometimes appeared to lack empathy on issues such as health and the homelessness crisis.He told host Pat Kenny: “I care about this country. I probably can’t put it into words as well as my opponent, but I do it with my actions...I show my empathy in the work I do, maybe I don’t say it in the right words.”‘Extremely bright’Ms Noone said the Fine Gael leader was “extremely bright” and a “very decent guy”.“If I do say so, I am much more natural than he would be. I’ve been in rooms with him and he doesn’t know what to do with himself. He’s naturally shy. But he’s actually a very good politician.”She added: “He’s not into the nudge and wink, any of that craic. If you’re looking for him to appoint someone, and you say ‘they’re a Fianna Fáiler’, he’ll say, ‘I just want the best person for the job.’ I really respect that about him.”According to The Times Ireland, when contacted for clarification of her remarks on Monday, Ms Noone initially denied that she used the word “autistic”, but when informed a recording existed, she said she did not mean the word literally.“I didn’t mean it in the sense of the actual illness or anything. I just mean he can be a bit wooden and lacking in empathy,” she said. “I shouldn’t have even said it in that way.”The Times Ireland quoted Ms Noone as attempting to give examples of potentially offensive words that could be used out of context, such as “special” and “n***er”. She quickly clarified that she would never use the latter word and said that it was a bad example, The Times Ireland said.Ms Noone argued that her comment had been taken out of context. The Times Ireland reported she said: “Sometimes I say, ‘Oh God, I’m a bit special’ but I don’t mean it to be derogatory.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4154135.1580227206!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election fact check is the pensions timebomb a myth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople Before Profit TD Bríd Smith dismissed the ‘pensions timebomb’ as ‘a myth. Is it though? Next year’s extension of the State pension age by another year to 67, depriving those who retire at 65 of the right to their full pension for two years, has become a major election issue.Political parties are promising changes to the phased increase in the pension age introduced in 2014 to reduce the cost of the State’s pension bill, which will over the coming decades as the population gets older and the ratio of working-age people to pensioners falls.Sinn Féin and People Before Profit have pledged to change the State pension age back to 65. Both parties have dismissed the financial consequences facing the State from funding pensions for a larger number of people with a smaller proportion of working people.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald has said that “the demographics will look after themselves” and People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith dismissed the “pensions timebomb” as “a myth”.Smith said there was “no empirical evidence” to show that the ratio of working-age people to pensioners would decrease, as forecast. She said that she believed the population would “more than likely” grow, increasing the ratio of younger workers to pensioners.What do the statistics say?Expected future population changes led the government to raise the State pension age. The population is set to get older, meaning the number of older people is set to increase.The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has projected that the percentage of the population aged 65 and over will increase from 13.3 per cent in 2016 to 18.1 per cent in 2031 to 24.6 per cent by 2051.The CSO is assuming that life expectancy in Ireland will increase from 79.3 years in 2015 to 85.6 years in 2051 for men and from 83.3 years to 88.3 years for women.The Government’s 2019 National Risk Assessment report said that notwithstanding the proposed increase in State pension age from 65 to 68 in 2028, the number of people at State pension age and older would more than double from 586,000 to 1.4 million by 2055.An actuarial review, published in 2017, of the Social Insurance Fund, into which PRSI payments are made by workers and from which State pensions are paid, by accountants KPMG found that the ratio of workers to pensioners aged 66 and over will decline from 5:1 to 2.9:1 in 2035 and to 2:1 by 2055.The National Risk Assessment says that the ratio will increase in the future “in the absence of improbably large immigration of people of working age, which will impact on areas such as education, child income supports, healthcare, long-term care, transport, employment, housing and pension provisions”.The low ratio of working-age people to pensioners would, according to the 2017 actuarial review, present significant funding challenges with the Social Insurance Fund forecast to accumulate a potential deficit of up to €335 billion over the next 50 years.The problem is exacerbated by the low number of people in the private-sector workforce with private pensions. Only 35 per cent of private-sector employees are covered by a supplementary pension, presenting significant risks to the funding of future pensions.KPMG said that the phased increase in the State pension age to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028 would improve the ratio to 3.4 workers to every inidual aged 68 and over in 2035 and to 2.3 workers to every inidual aged over 68 in 2055.In other words, there would, as a consequence of a larger number of people on a later State pension age, be more working-age people in the country to pay for a larger State pension bill.So is the pensions timebomb “a myth” and will “the demographics look after themselves”?Not based on the available evidence.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4154261.1580233103!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in manifesto pledges huge increases in spending on housing health and children","story":"Launching its manifesto in Dublin, Sinn Féin promised action on housing, healthcare and \u0027putting money back into working people\u0027s pockets\u0027, along with a referendum on Irish unity.

It insists that the costs of its proposed measures have been approved by the Department of Finance.Ms McDonald also pledged to prioritise efforts to achieve Irish unity over the lifetime of the next government, but conceded that it was up to the British government to call a referendum on unity in Northern Ireland.

We are bound by blood and history and our futures also are inseparably linked. It is because of these strong bonds that I am writing this to you. Friends, the decision taken today to allow the Chinese – particularly the Huawei telecommmunications company – to build your 5G wireless networks is a terrible mistake. That may sound a bit melodramatic – but it is not.  Huawei is an extension of the Chinese government and a part of Beijing’s explicit “civil-military fusion” strategy, where government and industry work together to expand the power and influence of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Do you think the British intelligence services would relish the opportunity to build and to manage China’s domestic telecommunications networks? Of course they would. It would be an unparalleled opportunity to collect and exploit troves of data that could ultimately prove decisive in understanding and shaping one of the West’s most important geopolitical adversaries.So why on earth has your nation allowed the Chinese to deploy the functional equivalent of this capability in the United Kingdom? It is a catastrophic vulnerability to one of the world’s premier cyber aggressors and this is why the United States is pressing hard for you to reconsider.Central to the British Government\u0027s decision has been the assertion that the cybersecurity risks can be mitigated. While many experts disagree, there are enough credible voices making this argument that you might be understandably confused or sceptical of dire warnings. But suppose Chinese 5G networks are rendered completely secure, has the threat gone away?Chinese law says that all information – even your information – that transits, is stored on, or in any other way touches the networks of a Chinese company is considered “Chinese information” and, therefore, must be made available to the country’s intelligence services. Huawei\u0027s assurances that your information is protected from these laws are not credible and the fact that these networks can be technically “secured,” will do nothing to change this fact.Others point to the potential costs or lost economic opportunity that would accompany denying Chinese access to your 5G networks. These costs would indeed be significant and there is little that can be done in the near-term to prevent this – though it can be managed.But whatever these costs may be, they pale in comparison to the losses of security, sovereignty, and intellectual property that will most assuredly be extracted by Huawei. Why bother with the struggle of leaving the European Union only to run into the arms of the communist Chinese?Even more, if you think this choice is expensive now, imagine the bill in five years when the nation realises Huawei has been siphoning your information and exporting it to the CCP just as they did in 2012 with the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.More fundamentally, this decision will now set the conditions for how other nations in Europe will make this choice. The risk is that other governments will follow Britain in opting for Chinese technology and Beijing will have secured a strategic foothold that endangers the long-term security of the entire European Continent.Before making his decision, your Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, asked, “What is the alternative?” In one sense, this is a perfectly reasonable question for serious leaders to ask. A reasonable answer might be to encourage the development of a British telecommunications company that is able to provide for the nation’s long-term needs. On the other hand, “What is the alternative?” is never a reasonable response when your friend has been warning you not to put a loaded gun to your head.In the last several weeks, the United States has sent messages from our President, our Vice President, multiple lawmakers, and many intelligence and national security leaders – all with the same plea: friends, please, put the gun down.I hope for your sake I am wrong – but I fear this is a decision you will come to regret.Klon Kitchen is a 15-year veteran of the United States Intelligence Community, a former National Security Advisor to a US Senator and is now the Senior Fellow for Technology and National Security at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It is a well-known Danish position, and we will not change that.After breaking out in the city of Wuhan, the official number of confirmed cases of the new virus reached more than 4,000 in China as of Tuesday, with over 100 deaths.Some 50 infections have also been confirmed elsewhere in Asia, Europe and North America.On Tuesday, Jyllands-Posten\u0027s chief editor Jacob Nybroe said they would not dream of poking fun at the situation in China but also refused to apologise.We cannot apologise for something we don\u0027t think is wrong. We have no intention of being demeaning or to mock, nor do we think that the drawing does, Mr Nybroe said.As far as I can see, this here is about different forms of cultural understanding.Jylland-Posten is no stranger to controversy.

The densely populated city saw 1,750 infections and over 280 deaths during the epidemic.Speaking at a press conference wearing a face mask Carrie Lam - whose popularity is already at an all-time low from eight months of pro-democracy protests - buckled to widespread political pressure and public demands to limit transit from the mainland.Health workers spray disinfectant in a South Korean bus station Health workers had threatened to strike over the city’s response to the outbreak, with a union of hospital workers calling for the border to be closed for days.  The new coronavirus, which is believed to have begun in a seafood market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in the central Hubei province, has now spread to all provinces bar Tibet, prompting unprecedented lockdowns of multiple major cities, and severe curbs on transport systems and public gatherings. Over the weekend, China has urged its citizens to postpone trips abroad but millions had already embarked on trips for the Lunar New Year or on business in the weeks and days before Wuhan was completely sealed off. So far Thailand has reported 14 cases of infection, Hong Kong eight, Taiwan, seven and the US, Australia and Macau five each. Singapore, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia have reported four, France, three and Canada, Germany and Vietnam two. Over the past day, Cambodia has announced one. Germany’s two cases - the first evidence of human to human transmission in Europe - were identified as employees of Munich car parts supplier Webasto. Neither had travel links to China but they had picked up the virus from a meeting with a Chinese colleague who had visited from Shanghai and had no symptoms at the time. Quick spread of CoronavirusDr Emmanuel Andre, a practising doctor and professor of medical microbiology at KU Leuven University in Belgium, told The  this case would have a lot of consequences on approaches to contain the coronavirus. The important element here is that the disease can be transmitted through asymptomatic people. This means many of the measures we are taking, which are based on screening of symptoms and of people coming from China, are not sufficient,” he warned. Just as China is having difficulties controlling the disease, we may well have more problems in Europe, he added. The Ivory Coast is also investigating Africa\u0027s first potential case of the coronavirus. Dr Andre said he was surprised the new disease had not yet reached the continent. Many countries in Africa are super-connected with China. Over the last 20 years we have seen a huge increase in communication and China has invested millions in the continent.  Airport staff disinfect a plane at Bangkok airportSingapore, Germany and the US Centre for Disease Control are advising all-but-essential travel to China should be avoided. In a similar case to Germany, Japan said on Tuesday that a man with no recent travel to China had contracted the virus after driving tourists visiting from Wuhan.The man in his sixties from Nara in western Japan drove two groups of Wuhan tourists earlier in January and was hospitalised on Saturday with flu-like symptoms, the health ministry said.Japan has imposed new checks on travellers arriving from China, and is planning to dispatch a plane to Wuhan on Tuesday night to evacuate around 200 Japanese nationals from the city.Taiwan has also confirmed its first case of domestic transmission - it\u0027s eighth case, but the first in a patient without travel history to China. Until this point only Vietnam had confirmed domestic transmission.  The rapid infection rate has increased pressure on the World Health Organisation to declare a global health emergency rather than just an emergency for China. Coronavirus | Opinion and analysisTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, who is currently in China for crisis talks with officials and health experts, said on Tuesday that he is confident in China’s ability to control and contain the virus, adding that he did not support the evacuation of foreign nationals.  “We appreciate the seriousness with which China is taking this outbreak, especially the commitment from top leadership, and the transparency they have demonstrated,” said Dr Tedros.  He added that the WHO believes roughly 20 per cent of people with the coronavirus experience “severe” illness.But the WHO position has left some experts flummoxed. Dr Mark Eccleston-Turner, a lecturer in Global Health Law at Keele University, said the declaration of a public health emergency of international concern would be a “crucial step” in assisting China. “The legal criteria for a PHEIC have been met. The reasons for this not being declared a PHEIC are unclear, and do not align with the international legal obligations found in the International Health Regulations,” he said. Meanwhile, national capitals have been rolling out their own escalating precautions to protect their citizens. The Philippines stopped issuing visas on arrival to Chinese nationals on Tuesday, while officials in Russia\u0027s Far East closed border crossings with China and travel agencies said they have stopped accepting package holiday makers from China.Taiwan, which announced its seventh case on Tuesday, has prohibited Hubei residents from visiting the island and will impose a two-week ban on Chinese students planning to go to Taiwanese universities.  After it emerged at the weekend that the ability of the deadly coronavirus to spread is becoming stronger and it can infect people even if its carrier shows little or no symptoms, the UK has joined other countries, including the US and Japan, in a desperate scramble to evacuate their nationals. Nick, a dual US and UK citizen who is teaching English at an international school in Wuhan, told The  that the streets are eerily empty as most people are staying inside to try and avoid catching the coronavirus. “We\u0027re all washing our hands every five minutes, he said. Deadly coronavirus reaches Europe: in picturesBut he said that he and his Indonesian wife and two children, 12 and nine, who have British and Indonesian citizenship, had barely heard from the UK government, despite contacting them several times. By contrast, the Indonesian government had been amazing at keeping in touch with his wife with developments and advice. It really is frustrating, we just don\u0027t understand - England is supposed to be a powerhouse of world diplomacy, he added.Politics latest news: Dominic Raab admits risk in UK telecoms cannot be eliminated after Huawei given role in 5GComment: It’s time to bring back Beeching’s lost linesScotch and US whisky industries issue joint plea to stop \u0026#39punitive\u0026#39 tariffsGauguin sculpture bought by LA Getty Museum for $3m is revealed as a fakeWomen in labour are being denied help on maternity wardsWoman throws out mother\u0026#39s old Bisto tins containing her £20k savings thinking they were rubbishDenmark refuses to apologise to China over coronavirus cartoonDonald Trump hands swathes of land to Israel in Middle East peace planComment: By stoking toxic Anglophobia, Leo Varadkar is digging his own political grave Rail passenger satisfaction rises despite greater delays and overcrowdingBrexit day: what happens after January 31?Tuesday evening news briefing: Huawei granted access to UK\u0026#39s 5G networkRussia furious with Ukraine after president sides with Poland in WWII whitewash rowComment: Huawei is not the only obstacle to a full-fat post-Brexit trade deal with AmericaGroundhog Day: how the Punxsutawney Phil prediction at Gobbler\u0026#39s Knob forecasts the weatherCoronavirus infection: everything you need to know about the outbreak from China Comment: Nigeria must clean up its act to lure hard-headed Western investors  Millionaire inventor accused of stealing garden while his neighbour was abroadWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/14/TELEMMGLPICT000221302178_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"stoking toxic anglophobia varadkar digging political grave","story":"Ireland’s PM proved this week that he’s not above the age old ploy of rattling a sabre in the face of traditional enemies abroad to make himself look tough to voters back home.Rousing the ancient spectre of nationalism will help Sinn Fein by normalising their beliefsLeo Varadkar likes to think of himself as a modern, liberal, laid back statesman, but Ireland’s prime minister proved this week that he’s not above the age-old ploy of rattling a sabre in the face of traditional enemies abroad to make himself look tough to voters back home.Unluckily for him, it’s all but certain that the Taoiseach, who swept in on the coat tails of his predecessor on a wave of goodwill three years ago, will, in less than two weeks, lose the first election he’s ever held as leader. Faced with that humiliation, he’s clearly decided to go all in by using the week in which Britain leaves the EU to remind the neighbours that they’re minor league players compared to the 27-strong continental bloc, saying: “I don’t think the UK has yet come to terms with the fact it’s now a small country.”It’s no surprise that Varadkar  goes along with that tiresome chattering class cliché but making an issue of Britain’s “colonial history”, even if he had the self-awareness to look slightly sheepish as he did so, is not only uncalled for, but churlish. It’s certainly no way to talk to a country that Varadkar also referred to as an “old friend”.One of the few successes he’s had of late was helping get the withdrawal agreement over the line, which he managed to do by striking up a positive working relationship with Boris Johnson, thereby putting an end to a pernicious period during which relations between the two countries hit rock bottom. Suddenly, having quieted those ghosts, he decides for no good reason to raise them again.If the Taoiseach’s intention was to make himself appear indispensable to the next stage of talks, it’s too late. Irish voters are more concerned with record homelessness and a crumbling health system, and seem to have largely accepted that Brexit, while they might not like it, is happening. They’ve moved on.What’s really spooking Varadkar is the rise of Sinn Fein. The republican party has already seen off Labour, the traditional third wheel in Irish politics, and polls suggest they’re well placed this time to clip the wings of the two main centre parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.As it happens, polls always give Sinn Fein greater support than they achieve when real votes are cast. In last year’s local elections, the party only won nine per cent.But it’s inconceivable that the republican party won’t pick up seats in February, putting them in a strong position to demand a place in coalition. Both main parties have so far ruled that out, insisting Sinn Fein is unfit for government in Dublin, even as they demand it has an automatic place in government in Belfast but suspicions remain that a grubby deal might still be done.It’s not only younger voters with short memories who are being tempted by a party which still takes its orders from the IRA Army Council. Older voters who suffered during the financial crash also want change.Varadkar would appear to have decided the way to win back these disparate groups of the discontented is to stir the pot of nationalism and invite them all to take their minds off their woes by drinking deep from it. In all likelihood, that won’t wash either.Most of those inclined to vote for Sinn Fein are doing so because they’re attracted to the party’s populist, Corbyn-lite, “tax the rich” economics. That may prove a foolish gamble, but, like other disgruntled electorates around the world, Irish voters yearn for something to disrupt a status quo that isn’t working for them.If anything, rousing the ancient spectre of toxic nationalism will simply help Sinn Fein by normalising their Anglophobia. People in the Irish Republic always liked to boast that they were above the tribal hostilities of the North, but it hasn’t taken much recently to dredge it up again.Brit-bashing may have helped Varadkar domestically in those early post-referendum days, but, in trying to pull the same trick again, he’s just enabling forces which are much better at it than he is, and made himself look the smaller man into the bargain. Either that, or he’s already accepted defeat and is now just using the election to pitch for a plum job in Brussels.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Britain will go to the polls tomorrow to voteA surfer off the North East coast at TynemouthThe FCA said on Tuesday that it has asked banks how they decided on their new rates, which have clustered around 40 per cent. It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those currently paying a lot in daily fees are likely to see their borrowing costs reduced while those who are less heavily into their overdrafts will pay more.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Torches are lit using a flare ahead of the Up Helly Aa Viking festival.

It has previously warned that it would look at introducing a cap on overdraft charges if lenders did not introduce competitive rates.HSBC, First Direct, M\u0026ampS Bank and TSB will all introduce rates of 39.9 per cent while NatWest is to charge half a percentage point less. Nationwide has already brought in a 39.9 per cent rate for its current accounts and Barclays will charge 35 per cent.Lloyds Banking Group has said its customers will be charged new “personalised” overdraft rates of up to 49.9 per cent from April.In a letter to lenders, the FCA wrote: “We are writing to you to understand more about your new overdraft pricing and the measures you have in place to help customers who may be adversely impacted by the changes you are making to this pricing.”The watchdog introduced changes to overdraft rules after it found that unarranged overdraft fees can be 10 times as high as charges for payday loans.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those first visitors were expected to arrive later this year.Adding new segments to the ISS could allow more people to travel to the station by increasing the volume, Axiom said, as well as leaving space for new kinds of research such as isolation studies and Earth observation.SpaceX to send Nasa astronauts to space soon, Elon Musk saysOver time, Axiom hopes that the work currently being done on the International Space Station is gradually transferred to its new private segment, allowing for it to continue without interruption when the ISS\u0026nbspis retired.At that point it will be able to detach and serve as a self-contained space station. At that point, Nasa will no longer have to pay for the cost of running the ISS or launching a replacement, Axiom suggested.In 2018, Axiom commissioned designer Philippe Starck to create interiors for the habitation module of a possible space station. He described the result as a comfortable and friendly egg.Starck’s vision was to create a nest, a comfortable and friendly egg, which would feature materials and colors stemmed from a fetal universe, a press release at the time said. The walls are sprinkled with hundreds of nano-Leds with changing colors as a continuation to the view on the universe through the large windows.Just as all the shades of lights and colors of day and night, the egg will also live to the mood and biorhythm of its osmotic inhabitant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Melis suggested that deregulation after Brexit could help persuade financial services businesses to remain in the UK.“If the government can position the UK as having a more favourable regulatory environment and separate it from the red tape of European regulation, then we may see the UK win back its crown and attract new talent to the sector,” Melis said.Adopting a light-touch approach to regulation after Brexit – dubbed the “Singapore-on-Thames” model by some critics – would likely prove controversial.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release.

Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release.

The video has since gone viral and the oil worker shared an update on the kittens’ health.Writing on Facebook, Mr Diwisch said: “So today I found these three fellows on one of the back roads near one of my wells. Most likely dropped off. Poor things were frozen into the ice so they had to have been there all night.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“All three little rascals went to their new home today where they get to be together instead of separating them. All three are eating and drinking and very energetic. Thanks for everyone’s consideration and offering to take them very appreciated.”The video, captured last Wednesday, shows Mr Diwisch approaching the poor kittens in the snow. He can be heard talking on camera, saying: “Look at these little guys. It’s alright, it’s ok. You’re frozen to the ice. Have you been here all night?”One of the cats is free but his friends have their tails frozen to the ground. Once Mr Diwisch sees this he goes to his truck, brings back warm coffee, pours it on the felines and is able to get them free.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A protester holds a sign reading On the move mocking the LREM party\u0027s slogan during a demonstration in Paris, as part as a nationwide multi-sector strike against the French government\u0027s pensions overhaulA Chinese police officer wears a protective mask as he stands guard next to an ad before the annual Spring Festival at a Beijing railway station.

Network Rail wants to move a mile-long stretch of track that runs beside a beach in Devon, saying it’s vulnerable to falling rocks AND pounding waves.Protesters say this is nonsense, and they’re right. Simple as.Yes, the track is vulnerable. In  it was destroyed by a storm and, while it was being repaired, Cornwall was effectively cut off from the rest of the country.But this bit of track, designed and built by Brunel, is extremely pretty and charming and that, in the coming years, is going to matter more than a few Corns being cut off for a week or two.As we leave Europe, we have in our minds that we will be a modern, dynamic nation with magnetic levitation transportation systems linking all the towns and villages. We see glass towers piercing the clouds in Rochdale and space ports in Basingstoke.Ain’t going to happen.If we decide that everything old-fashioned and historical must go to make le more modern, then we can wave goodbye to the Tower of London, because that piece of real estate should obviously be sold to commercial developers.They say the submersibles these people use are causing “untold damage” to the ship.Hmm. Not half as much damage as the iceberg did, I’ll wager.The Roman walls in York  Stupid. Replace them with nuclear free peace cafes. Stonehenge  Smash it up and build polytunnels.And while we are at it, we can turn Portmeirion into a wind farm, capitalise on the crescent in Bath with advertising hoardings and replace all the dry stone walls in the Yorkshire Dales with plastic fencing.Oh, and then there’s the Royal Family.It’s obviously idiotic to have a system of government where you can become head of state just because you’re the first-born child of a German woman and a Greek man. So let’s get rid of that and have a president instead. That way, we could have someone we know in Buckingham Palace. Piers Morgan perhaps. Or Phillip Schofield.The fact is that Britain is a boutique.Millions of foreign visitors come every year to marvel at our pomp and tradition. They love our changing of the guard, and our castles and our awkward Elizabethan houses. They laugh at us when we try to be modern but lap up our Rolls-Royces and our Bentleys which are made, by Germans, to feel as old-fashioned as the Queen’s underwear drawer.We send a young, fresh band to the Eurovision Song Contest and it comes last. Then the judges go home to listen to The Beatles and The Who.We need to capitalise on that. We need the red telephone boxes back. We need warty peasants on every street corner and lots of men tipping their bowler hats when they see a lady.Because then, tourists will be queuing round the block to give us their dollars and their dongs.And we can start by leaving that pretty bit of railway line in Devon alone.Yes, it’ll mean that from time to time Cornwall will be cut off. But I’m willing to bet a lot of Corns won’t mind that.

But what made it became so huge was ill-informed eco thinking.In recent years, Australians have faced huge finesthey cut down a tree or even collect fallen branches.This means that when a fire starts, it has a ton of dry wood to get its teeth into.

All good stuff.The only toxic fly in the Fair Trade, ethically sourced, organic ointment was that Charles flew to Switzerland in a private jet, emitting around six tons of carbon dioxide.There are excuses. Or,you are being generous, reasons.Charles was on his way to Israel and Palestine, where security concerns make commercial flights unviable.But after all of Charles’ fine words on climate change, the use of a private jet sent a dferent message.He was campaigning to save the planet decades before that was fashionable. But whatever the merits of his beliefs on climate change, the brutal fact is that establishment hypocrisy makes most people reach for the mute button.The nation’s honeymoon with Harry and Meghan did not end because we are racist bigots who could never accept a mixed-race woman in the Royal Family.Harry and Meghan were adored.They broke the spell when they wagged their virtuous fingers about climate change while hopping on and off private jets.

Mounties will do the heavy lting and British taxpayers will get the bill. THAT is why we went right off Harry and Meghan — their rank establishment hypocrisy.We have been endlessly told Harry and Meghan plan to refund us for the eye-watering £.million it cost to do up Frogmore Cottage, the beautul home in Windsor they no longer need or want.A refund I will believe it when I see it.Can we get a receipt THE Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Bill received Royal Assent from the Queen on Thursday. After all the years of pain and paralysis, it was finally official.The UK is leaving the European Union.Yet this historic moment did not even warrant a mention on the BBC’s Six O’Clock News.Incredible.And conclusive proof that the BBC no longer speaks for the nation.So the new Director-General of the Beeb has an existential problem.Because everyone at the corporation voted Remain, the largest vote for anything in our history – leaving the EU – has been treated as the ignorant spasm of .million uneducated, racist bigots.From crappy little comedy- shows to prestige news and current affairs, the BBC has been unapologetically biased against Brexit.The state broadcaster should be scrupulously neutral.In recent years, the BBC has been brazenly partisan.Look, we all have fond memories of growing up with the BBC.

She gives her take on how an inability to retain independence left Meghan feeling vulnerable.Jo also reveals how free-spirited Meghan was not always able to make the compromises necessary to accept the constraints of royal le and analyses the “boyfriend shirt” she wore when first dating Harry . . . plus the Hamsa ring she put on to ward off evil.I ALWAYS feel deeply unsettled when my own feelings of love, goodwill and optimism are turned on a sixpence in exchange for scepticism, cynicism and disappointment.It indicates very strongly that I feel cheated and, perhaps worst of all, fooled.It is no exaggeration to say that this has been the personal rollercoaster of emotions I have been on with Meghan and Harry.I vividly remember standing in my garden that sweltering day during May , looking through the living-room window to watch their royal weddingand welling up with the emotion and promise of it all.Strangely, I don’t recall experiencing the same when William and Kate married seven years earlier, but there was something truly signicant about Meghan joining The Firm.She signied new, fresh, modern, showbizzy blood — and abundant, gracious, progressive attitudes.Above all , the love they had for each other was palpable.Perhaps I should already have been exercising some caution with my enthusiasm when Harry fired warning shots across the media about the treatment of his girlfriend and the supposed racist undertones.But I, for one, felt utterly encouraged and buoyant about this woman’s humility, dignity, compassion and empathy.What could possibly go wrong Now,  months down the line, I cannot deny I feel hoodwinked — and can well imagine that is how much of the population feels.As a nation of welcoming Brits , it is like we invited Meghan into our adorable, unpretentious and homely BB. She stayed for dinner, took the complimentary soaps and shampoos then walked out in search of the nearest hotel.Regardless of how they want to dress it up, the two of them have turned their backs on the UK and it feels like a kick in the teeth.What really stings is that it does not feel like it was a long-term plan, but it simply came about when Meghan re-read the membership rules, months after signing on the dotted line, and decided it cramped her style. I’m pretty certain all the statutes will have been made clear to her from the start, many times over. Everything will have been scrutinised and pored over in minute detail. The Royal Family is a watertight institution, after all.But propelled by her personal ambition, and presumably a wilfulness to reform the family, becoming a royal would not only give her a  for her humanitarian work but also fame on a level she would have been unlikely to have otherwise ever achieved.What she could not cope with was her loss of control and the fact that being part of a team inevitably means diminished autonomy.But some of her story has echoes of when Sarah Ferguson joined the family back in the Eighties.Fergie was a jolly, fun, self-deprecating young woman who thought she would have the ride of a letime. But she found herself profoundly restricted by her mother-in-law’s budget and her husband’s dullness. Instead of making a dignied exit, she had her toes sucked by another man because le was not as much fun as it had promised to be. It was ugly.The prospect of joining the Royal Family would fill me with horror — and it did so even way back in , when I was pictured alongside HRH Prince Edward at the theatre.I had become good friends with his best friend, James Baker.One night I joined James, Edward and another of his friends to go to the theatre.By sheer coincidence I was “papped” next to the prince.Excited and furious speculation ensued the following day about the mystery Swedish blonde — I was  and not yet on the ladder of fame — and I was quickly dubbed his latest flame. One newspaper even ran the headline “The Prince And The Showgirl” with old photos of me in school drama productions.It was my first experience of such widespread exposure and it came as an absolute shock.HRH was kind enough to phone me to offer his support and urge me to “say nothing”, which I duly did.After some months, the two of us did have a few dates, and while I, a most common commoner, would never have been considered “royal material”, le in The Firm crossed my mind on a few occasions.And it did not especially fill me with joy.I got the strong impression Prince Edward himself would have given anything to get in a car and drive away from it all, which was hardly the greatest endorsement. But despite getting a lot of flak over preceding years for dropping out of the Marines and then pursuing a career in the arts, the prospect of him walking away would never have been one he would have seriously entertained.His sense of duty, loyalty and obligation was too great.I really got a good insight into the restrictive le he led, along with his lack of access to any kind of normality.All the while he was surrounded by rules and traditions, and then there are the courtiers and staff, there to stle and control your many moves, constantly keeping your behaviour in check.I would go to dinner and bring my own bottle of white wine because budget and taste would have dictated a ghastly bottle of Liebfraumilch or some other type of sweet white wine, and thus a less fun evening.Because despite the Royal Family being an international brand, it seemed at the time, at least, that “taste” as such had somehow eluded Prince Edward.He was stuck with whatever the butler would bring and I am guessing money spent on wine was not considered money well spent.The foodwas decidedly plain and a tad dull.Everything in his apartment was so staid and old-fashioned.Nothing had been redecorated for decades and the bathroom had a very quaint old toilet.In my naivety, I had foolishly thought the royals would have the absolute latest in fashion and interiors, but it was like stepping back in time.Perhaps this was how Meghan experienced things, too, but with thoughts and attitudes. I would swear and push the boundaries because I felt it might amuse and maybe inspire more than a touch of reality and authenticity.But the thought of a loon like me being shackled to his le was enough to make me want to run for the hills — regardless of the universal fame that might have been waiting.The idea of a woman as fiercely independent as Meghan being defined and tethered by such an exclusive, traditional club seems, with hindsight, utterly impossible.Her initial sense of goodwill and charitable ambition appears to have been overtaken by her refusal to accept any opinion or critique.I am afraid I know to great personal cost that the limelight can be blinding.But it is a deal you make with yourself and, in her case, it was a deal she made with the British public — to serve.It is not asshe has given it her best shot for seven years and can no longer hack it.This self-defeating move away reeks of impatience, petulance and bitterness.Put simply, her new le became burdensome and an inconvenience when she discovered she could not run her own show.Her father, like mine — who opened his doors to the media when I was photographed next to Prince Edward — became a thorn in her side and she had no tools with which to deal with him.He became an embarrassment a mistake and a mess she could easily have dealt with but felt it more important to proceed with her new le and leave him behind. And then there is Harry: A man smitten and obsessed, a man who has been waiting for a Meghan all his le, someone to nurture him.He has sacriced everything for his we, willingly.He has given up all that he has ever known and everyone he holds dear to chance it all thousands of miles away, isolating himself in pursuit of a le that is not only unclear but precarious.There is no doubt that the Royal Family needs reduction and considerable reform to reflect modern times.But the thought that a newcomer might consider herself best positioned to be that subversive influence would be laughableit was not so hurtful and insulting to much of this country that has been so supportive of this historical institution. The noises from Team Sussex have been distracting, persistent and problematic because the le of a royal is, I am afraid, to toe the line.There is no halfway house, no part-time royalty — the job is not part of the gig economy.By trying to carve out a more contented, niche le for themselves, the Sussexes have made survival considerably more complicated with absolute exposure guaranteed and a letime’s guarantee of judgment and critique.I cannot be the only one who feels painfully disappointed and cheated, beguiled by Hollywood stardust and  promises.And now we are left wondering what the whole shebang was all about, becauseHarry and Meghan thought exiting was challenging, when this all ends in tears — as I fear it will — coming back to the fold will be utterly inconceivable.I DO believe that Meghan married Harry with good intentions and had every belief she could make a positive contribution to the Royal Family.I can also see how Harry, a vulnerable young man who lost his beloved mother at such an early age, could fall in love with a strong, independent woman who could provide some direction.What I do not think Meghan was prepared for was the pressure of doing everything by the book and having to follow so many rules once she had entered into the so-called Firm.The former actress was the first senior royal to have come from a background where she had already established her own successful career.She is an ambitious and determined woman who is not afraid to speak her mind and wants to do things her own way.Meghan is certainly assertive. She is determined in the face of adversity but is also vulnerable and perhaps not as tough as she likes to make out.It is also clear that she became deeply unhappy with royal le and her inability to retain her independence.During all that turmoil, Meghan was not able to publicly speak out about her feelings, so would send subtle messages.She would express how she felt through her jewellery, such as the butterfly earrings she wore shortly after her pregnancy was announced, which symbolised lightness against tension and the sense of hope and endurance.She was also seen wearing a Hamsa ring, used to ward off evil, while in the Canadian embassy. It was the day before the bombshell announcement that they were moving abroad.She often handled her pregnancy bump, wanting consciously or otherwise to draw attention to her developing baby and what it represented moving forward — her new future and family.There is no doubt in my mind that as much as Meghan adores Harry, she had a clear focus in mind from the moment they began to have feelings for each other. There were no coy hints or suggestions from her, as there were with Kate.Nor was she prepared to play the waiting game, hanging on in there until Harry was ready to propose.From the white “boyfriend shirt” she wore right at the beginning of their relationship to the way she looked at Harry and touched him, even in public, Meghan did not shy away from being loud and proud about where she wanted things to head.I think this behaviour stems from a stubborn insecurity that will not go away, and Meghan is not good with situations that are out of her control.Perhaps her coping mechanisms are not as strong as she thought. Maybe she is so determined her family will not suffer like she has in the past that she has become super-protective and frustrated at times.Meghan has had to battle a fair amount of adversity in her le, even before she met Harry.This includes a dficult, and now estranged, relationship with her father and half-sibling, with whom she no longer speaks.I do wonder why she seems to be cut off from her close childhood friends. And why do some of Harry’s oldest pals feel they have been discarded as a result of his relationship with Meghan She is a strong influence on Harry, undoubtedly.Meghan would probably admit that she is strong-willed, not always able to make the sacrices or compromises which are necessary to accept criticism or interference from the Royal Family.Perhaps there is a touch of the narcissist about her, putting her own feelings ahead of the dutul le she signed up to.For example, she seems to find it dficult to understand what her father has been going through or see his perspective.Also, when she told the ITV documentary crew, “It’s not enough to just survive something”, before adding, “You have to thrive”, that shows how important her own happiness and wellbeing is to her.But many strong and influential people have that narcissistic streak. They find it hard to tolerate a situation that makes them feel distressed or to manage a situation over which they have little control.What is interesting is that, following the move to North America, Meghan and Harry have effectively swapped roles.Instead of Meghan being the royal princess at Harry’s side, he will now be more at her behest, having to adapt to a totally dferent sort of le, and one that he could never have imagined.He might feel some resentment in due course, or he may adapt like a duck to water.Will their marriage last They have a tough journey ahead, but I hope so and I wish them well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It began in the far eastback in  and since then, has spread to Italy, Argentina, Mexico, South Africa and Vietnam, where it’s presented by Hoang Rapper. Seriously.Five weeks ago the global pandemic reached Britain and those millions of us who were infected have spent an uncomfortable month trying to work outThe Masked Singer is so bad it’s good or merely so bad it’s an affront to humanity.Somewhat reluctantly, I’ve finally got to admit it’s the former, despite having more than enough self-inflicted wounds and production flaws to sink most programmes.The Masked Singer is, for starters, no sort of contest, and while some of the singers, like Chameleon Justin Hawkins, disguise their identity brilliantly, John Barrowman could no more hide his showbiz light under the Large Hadron Collider than he could a unicorn outfit.There are also issues with that hopelessly random , Jonathan, Rita, Davina McCall and Donny Osmond Ken Jeong, who are either deliberately muddying the waters or are actually thick and deluded enough to believe a Joel Dommett-fronted show might also feature “Margot Robbie”, “Ray Winstone”, “Gemma Arterton”, “Helen Mirren” and “Olivia Colman”, in fancy dress outfits.God knows, it must be hard for them to confront the idea The Masked Singer is now the biggest thing in their careers. The only people I actually feel sorry for, though, are the poor dancers who’ve suffered the torments of hell on this show.The absolute worst of which was doing the twist, wearing only towels and snorkels, while that trippy octopus thing sang Splish Splash standing up in a bath. Yet still I watch. Why  Well, I’ve no realistic choice when the alternative is as tedious as BBC’s The Greatest Dancer.But I’d also choose The Masked Singer over X Factor, The Voice UK and practically any other Saturday night alternative the two main channels have served up recently, for the simple reason the basic guessing game concept and the end-of-show reveal are infuriatingly brilliant.Indeed, I’d go so far as to say Tutankhamun removing his head to reveal former Home Secretary Alan Johnson is one of the TV highlights of the year so far. Inevitably, the overlong shows, repetitive nature of the process and relative disappointments, like discovering it was Kelis in the daisy outfit, will quickly cure me.I’m sticking with The Masked Singer for now, though, because a slightly better bet than Natalie Cole has just reared its head in the duck outfit.

Or possibly Billy. Or maybe even Ollie. “Put the casualty on the f***ing stretcher. Grab the f***ing stretcher and f***ing get him off the f***ing hill. That’s how we f***ing do it. Now move.”A big ask, I think you’ll agree, and the only one who seemed equal to it was James, an estate agent, who’s cracked every single challenge but not a single smile since episode one.He has, however, hinted at a very dark backgroundand claimed, with an entirely straight face: “It’s dficult to sayI’m good at hiding my emotions, ’cos I don’t have many.”No sooner had he said it, though, than Ant and the boys were pressing play on a Skype message from his mum. “Hi Peanut!” At which point James turned into a blubbing, schoolboy wreck.THE burning issue and question on Channel ’s mind last night was Bring Back The Bush: Where Did Our Pubic Hair Go  Where indeed  If it isn’t exactly where you left it or down the back of the sofa.Who worse to investigate this pressing issue, then, than Chidera Eggerue, the creative force behind the “Saggy Boobs Matter” campaign, who clearly craves attention and victim status but hasn’t worked out any better way of getting them than by making a gigantic exhibition of herself.So she’d set herself a real “challenge” here. “I’m growing my pubic hair for the next six weeks.” Exactly the sort of zero-effort empty gesture millennials seem to love.Chidera wasn’t quite confident enough in the project to go it alone, though, so she’d roped in four other minge martyrs to sprout away, while she went to LA to gawp at a porn shoot and work out why it was all the fault of men and the media.With the help of some anecdotal cobblers and an old copy of Playboy, Chidera eventually established the “flawless, hairless women” era was all about blokes “policing women’s bodies”, and the only way to fight back was, as I’d feared: “By revealing our bushes to the world.”When push came to shave, though, two of her mates insisted on wearing massive pants for the climactic photoshoot, the smartest one opted out completely and Chidera herself unveiled something that could’ve been her chuff, but could just as easily have been Ben Kingsley in All Hail The King.

At times since the decisive referendum vote in , it looked asBrexit would remain a distant fantasy, thanks to the determination of much of the pro-EU establishment to overturn the result.But in the end, the will of the public has prevailed over federalist ideology. The dream of national freedom is about to become a reality.This change in status will represent a daunting challenge for Britain. No longer a regional province in the EU’s empire, we will take charge of our own destiny, with control over our economy, borders, laws, trade and justice system.With self-governance comes tremendous responsibility - and doubts and concerns about trade deals. But our nation can rise to the test.Indeed, Brexit could be the cue for the renewal of our institutions and the rebirth of our democracy.After all, we have achieved so much in the past as an independent nation, pioneering Parliamentary rule, leading the Industrial Revolution, and defeating tyranny in two World Wars.Given this heritage, there is no reason why Britain cannot embrace a new era of greatness.Yet that is not how the embittered Remainers see our future. Immersed in their worship of Brussels, obsessed with goal of European integration at the expense of nationhood, they continually preach the gospel of defeatism and despair.According to their gloomy propaganda, Brexit is a disastrous mistake, which will leave Britain hopelessly in decline.In their view, our country cannot survive on its own. The cold winds of isolation will be felt outside the warm embrace of the EU federation.This is the message that the pro-EU brigade has been peddling for years, ever since the referendum was first proposed.During the  campaign, the Government embarked on its notorious Project Fear, full of grim warnings about the dire consequences of abandoning our EU membership.One Treasury paper predicted that a vote for Leave would “represent an immediate and profound shock to the economy,” followed by a massive rise in unemployment and a meltdown in sterling.But these dire forecasts have not been realised. Instead, since , the British economy has proved to be remarkably robust.There has been no recession, no collapse in the property market, no explosion in the dole queues. On the contrary, the British jobs miracle has continued to accelerate.Only last week, official figures revealed that unemployment is down to its lowest level since , while the national workforce is at its largest in history.Particularly striking is the rise in self-employment to over five million, which indicates that the culture of enterprise is flourishing.Investors have not been deterred by Brexit.According to the Financial Times, “UK equities are positioned to outperform their peers in Europe and the USA.Manufacturing is also poised to prosper. Last week a survey by the Confederation of British Industry highlighted the biggest surge in confidence within this sector on record.Commenting on the “bullish” economic mood in Britain, the distinguished German journalist Alexander Von Schoenburg, editor-at-large of the bestselling BILD newspaper, wrote last weekend: “I see a nation with a strong sense of purpose, built on trust in its own capabilities and a powerful economy.I see a vibrant, open place that can attract huge amounts of foreign investment, has an unrivalled record in business start-ups and is a global pioneer in scientic and genetic research.”Von Schoenburg is right. Our independent future can be a golden one. Already the International Monetary Fund, which in  warned of recession, now predicts that over the next two years, economic growth will be twice as fast in the UK as in any other G state in Europe.What the pessimists ignore are the huge advantages held by Britain, like the global dominance of the English language, the cultural reach of our arts, music and entertainment industries, the strength of our financial services and the solidity of our political system - which was recently demonstrated again in the defeat of Jeremy Corbyn’s quasi-revolutionary Labour party.A recent poll of , chief executives, carried out by the consultancy firm PwC, found that the UK is increasingly attractive to global businesses looking for growth and investment opportunities.Commenting on the survey, PwC’s chairman Kevin Ellis said that “viewed against the turbulent global backdrop, the UK is a beacon of relative stability.”Indeed, on the eve of Brexit, the real crisis is faced, not by Britain, but by the EU and its member states.Whereas Britain can show its dynamism by the embrace of global competition and commerce, Europe is still trapped in outdated economic structures, characterised by heavy regulation, state intervention and unaffordable welfare.Almost every European nation is now in trouble, dragged down by sluggish growth and political dislocation.While Germany hovers on the brink of recession, France is in turmoil because of ferocious opposition to attempts by President Macron’s Government to reform its vast public sector and expensive pension schemes.Spain is now in the grip of socialism, Italy in economic sclerosis. Ireland’s current General Election is unlikely to give any one party more than  per cent of the vote, a recipe for more fragility.For the EU itself, Brexit represents a threat to its very existence.That is not just because of the loss of Britain’s budget contributions, signicant though they are.It is more becauseBritain prospers outside the EU, then the justication for Brussels rule would be permanently demolished.All the claims about the necessity of political integration would be exposed as delusions. That is why pro-EU campaigners so dread the possibility of a booming Britain on the continent’s doorstep.Our success would be the EU’s nightmare.There is, of course, no guarantee that Britain will flourish.There could be dficult times ahead, prompted by a global recession or the refusal of the USA to reach a trade deal because of security objections to the involvement of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei in our broadband network.Equally, the EU might prove tough in its own negotiations with us about a trade agreement. Already this week the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has warned that the EU has “the upper hand” and the “stronger team”.But the cause of British independence has triumphed over serious obstacles in the recent past.With determination and vision, our country can do so again, emboldened by the taste of freedom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Stay safe!It comes as all recent passengers arriving in the UK from Wuhan in China were ordered to stay at home - eventhey feel well.Any Brits evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the deadly outbreak, in the coming days will also be asked to self-quarantine for at least two weeks.The warning from health secretary Matt Hancock comes amid fears the lethal coronavirus thats killed at least , is more contagious than previously thought.Scientists warn there is evidence the virus can be transmitted eventhe carrier has no symptoms, such as a fever or cough.Coronavirus is an airborne virus, spread in a similar way to colds and the flu.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.Ministers want all , people who have flown in from Wuhan since mid-January to remain indoors and limit contact with others for at least a fortnight.But officials admit only one in ten has so far been tracked down - making it harder to enforce the proposed lockdown.Public health bosses were accused of wrongly telling carriers arriving from China that they didnt need testing for the flu-like illness.Englands chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said there was a fair chance cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about , including  deaths, which have all occurred in China.Last night, it emerged that suspected coronavirus carriers who have arrived from China in recent days were reportedly only testedthey had the snfles.Reports emerged after the Chinese government announced on Sunday that infected people can spread the virus for up to two weeks before showing any symptoms.A senior NHS source told the newspaper that patients who called the  service had not been offered tests unless they showed signs of the virus.They said: “Our specialists followed the official advice from Public Health England to the letter.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they must pay up-front and claim the costs back later, which leaves some facing four-figure bills. The Department for Work and Pensionssays the policy is to prevent fraud. But Nichola’s formal legal claim, backed by Save the Children, alleges the rule is unlawful, discrimination and breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. Are you a struggling parent  Email webnews@mirror The -year-old, who lives with daughter Sofia, , in Portslade, was stung when she moved from Citizens’ Advice to a full-time job with a housing association in September. She was forced to cut her hours and borrow £, from payday lenders and family to cope with childcare costs.  She told the Mirror: “I have struggled since July.” The childcare cash pays for after-school clubs for Sofia. But Nichola couldn’t get extra DWP help to stump up an advance payment, because she had earned more than £, in six months. Nichola, who has a degree and expertise on the benefits system, added: “I wouldn’t finish work until pm and it was a  minute commute. “I try to think what it’s like for families or lone parents with a child before nursery age. “If I can’t figure my way out of this then how is anyone  going to  “I guess I thought I would be able to get some kind of help in advance for the child care costs. I knew that under the Tax Credits system I could apply in advance. “I have had to borrow and couldn’t have any luxuries.” Nichola said she would have been faced with a £, bill in one monthshe had not cut her hours. Some , households including , single parents were claiming childcare costs under UC last August. But the number is rising all the time as more people join UC, and is expected to eventually reach as high as ,. Nichola is seeking permission for judicial review of the law. A decision on whether her case can proceed to a full High Court hearing is expected in the next five or so weeks. Her legal action says the childcare policy “disproportionately adversely affects women” and “disadvantages parents who lack the funds to pay the upfront costs of childcare.” Branding the policy “irrational” under the law it adds: “It stands in stark contrast to the way in which other components of Universal Credit are paid.” Save the Children head of UK child poverty Becca Lyon said: “The way childcare is paid for through Universal Credit causes unnecessary hardship to parents on low incomes - the majority of whom are single mothers.

Boris Johnson will hold a Cabinet meeting in the north before a night-time TV address from Downing Street, festooned with a projected countdown clock and a light show. million special p coins will enter circulation, Union flags will hand in Parliament Square and outside Buckingham Palace - and despite efforts to, Big Ben wonapost bong. No one can deny itaposs a historic moment. Britain is the first nation ever to leave. But what about beyond the pomp and ceremony  What will actually change for you, your loved ones and the country  Hereaposs a guide to what our leaving the EU on Friday means. This is the legal moment that the UK becomes the first nation ever to leave the European Union - after three failed exit dates of March , April  and October  last year. Itaposs at pm because thataposs midnight Brussels time. At this instant, the EU Withdrawal Agreement Act, passed by Parliament last week, will take effect. It will translate thousands of EU regulations from recent decades into UK law, to ensure we donapost fall into a legal black hole.It will also make legal the apostransition periodapos, continuing EU rules until December , and begin £bn in aposorce billapos payments to the EU which stretch for several years. Meanwhile, No will mark the moment with a speech by Boris Johnson, a light show and a countdown clock projected onto the black bricks of  Downing Street. Just down the road in Parliament Square, Nigel Farage and Tory Brexiteers will hold a rally.  From pm the UK is legally out of the EU and can no longer cancel Brexit by revoking Article . UK citizens will cease to be citizens of the EU. If the UK wants to rejoin the EU, it has to do so under Article  of the Lisbon Treaty, a y process that needs the approval of all  states. Yet nothing much will change in your day-to-day le for  months, until  December . Thataposs because we are in a apostransition periodapos and continue to follow EU rules until then. The Brexit deal says the transition period can be extended by two years. But the government passed a law banning this. How much things change after  December depends on whether we get a trade deal with the EU.If we do, there will be a new set of rules from  January . If not, we could crash out on aposWTO termsapos - the basic rules that slap high tarfs and restrictions on trade. Thereaposs more detail below on the things that might change in January . But there are still some things that will definitely change from Friday. The Brexit Department will be abolished and a new Taskforce Europe Team within No will lead the UKaposs trade talks - headed by the PMaposs chief Europe adviser David Frost. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will lose his Cabinet job, though he could be given another one where. Blue passports will start being issued to all new applications, instead of the burgundy ones, from mid  and have already lost their European Union branding. Your old passport remains valid though, as long as itaposs in date. The economy will have some security thanks to the deal, but isnapost expected to rocket while speculation continues in the transition period.Some analysis has claimed house prices will rise as buyers move after years of uncertainty, but sellers are also coming on to the market too so the verdict is far from certain. These things wonapost change yet - but you should watch out Travelling abroad  Travel firms are insisting everything will remain the same for UK holidaymakers in the EU after January . That is because there will be no restrictions on travel to the EU until at least January . Queues of lorries at ports arenapost expected either because there will be no extra checks. But again, these could spring up in January  - especiallythere is no trade deal. The shape of the future relationship, trading checks or any travel restrictions is not yet established, and will be part of trade talks over the next  months.Passports and visas  Brits will not need a visa to travel to the EU after January . You can keep using EU passport gates at airports. UK government guidance says you wonapost need a visa from  January  either -youaposre a tourist. But you will have a limited stay of up to  days in any -day period, and you may need a visa or permit to stay for longer. You may also need to show aticket, show you have enough money for your stay, and stop using EU passport lanes at European borders. From , Brits must also have at least six months left on their passportsgoing to the EU. Your passport must also be no more than  years old, evenit has time left, from  January . Driving abroad  After January , a UK driving licence is still the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel in the EU. But after  January  you may need to get an International Driving Permit. There are three types - make sure you get the right one for the right country. A full list is here. The £. documents were once a niche bit of paperwork but million a year are expected to be handed out. After  January  you also need to apply for a aposgreen cardapos to prove you have the right car insurance . Allow a month to get this from your insurance firm.You also need a GB bumper sticker. Bringing pets abroad  Pet owners can carry own bringing their beloved animals to the EU on apospet passportsapos until December. But they must prepare four months in advancethey are planning a holiday on or after  January . Current advice for after January  is the animal must have a rabies vaccination, followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But to add an extra layer of red tape, this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. So you need to get your timing right. Healthcare in the EU  Nothing changes from pm on Friday - but you should start preparing for . From the end of , the European Health Insurance Card , which gives Brits access to EU healthcare in an emergency, will no longer work. After that there will not be one EU-wide regime on healthcare. Instead it is up to the UK to strike reciprocal health cover with inidual states - a sort of aposweaposll fund your peopleyou fund oursapos system. Back last year the UK and Spain struck an agreement to continue health cover until the end of there was no deal. One might expect a pact after that too, but for other countries itaposs less certain. Because of this, travellers from the UK to EU are being told to ensure they have adequate insurance for the full duration of their trip in  and beyond. For EU migrants to the UK,there is no reciprocal agreement, there is a £-a-year charge to use the health service. EU citizens  EU citizens can continue arriving freely in the UK to live and work until  December . But they must apply by June  for settled status, which gives them the right to stay in the UK. Those who havenapost lived in the UK for five continuous years have to apply twice - first for pre-settled status, then again for settled status when they hit the five-year mark. After  January , new EU citizens who want to come to the UK will be subject to a points-based immigration system. They will have to prove their skills and probably earn a minimum salary. Mobile roaming  Again, there will be no change from January  - but things could change from  January . Upon leaving the EU, there will no longer be guaranteed free mobile phone roaming for UK customers on the Continent as the issue will be left to the market. Youaposre advised to check with your phone operatortravelling after  January . Moving abroad  UK citizens can continue arriving freely in EU countries to live and work until  December . But to stay after that date ex-pats will need to apply for a residency status. The exact system ies by country but the UK government claims it will be short, simple and either free of charge, or cost no more than applying for a similar document, for example a national identity card or passport. Guides for expats in each country will appear here as they are thrashed out.

Kate, dressed in Dolce  Gabbana, appeared genuinely touched by the painstakingly hand-made gts from Savannah Wheeler-Waddison, four, and her brother, Luke, ten, as she visited the Evelina Childrenaposs Hospital in Lambeth, south London. The duchess, who is patron of the hospital, was also there in her capacity as patron of the National Portrait Gallery , which runs creative arts workshops for young patients at hospitals across London. During the visit, she posed for childrenaposs photographs and is said to have bonded with a mum over aposlongapos waits for proposals. As she first arrived, Kate was handed two ‘rag’ wreaths - one pink and the other tartan, which Savannah and Luke later explained had taken them three or fours hours to make each. Kate exclaimed: Wow! That’s so lovely. Charlotte will love this! She also happily posed for a photo taken by Luke using a Polaroid-style instant camera, which the youngster, who was first operated on for a congenital heart condition at the hospital when he was just five days old, proudly showed off. Arriving at the hospital, the duchess was presented with a posy by Anna-Victoria Amoafa-Sennie, nine, who suffers from achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism. Kate sunk to her heels to thank the youngster before spending an unscripted fteen minutes chatting to staff, patients and parents who had lined the entrance hall to see what the fuss was all about. Unusually she also posed for several mobile phone pictures - something that was to become a theme of the day. The Duchess was also quizzed about theof time it took her husband, Prince William, to propose.  William and Kate met as students at St Andrews University in  but did not start dating until a few years later - and the duke proposed to his then girlfriend in October , with the couple marrying the following year. Sarah Ibendahl brought up the subject while Kate visited the hospital and said she sympathised with the duchess, as it took her husband Ralph the sameof time before he asked her to tie the knot. Mrs Ibendahl, from Blackheath, south-east London - whose three-year-old son Benjamin is being treated for an auto-immune condition, said after meeting the duchess on a ward: We also bonded over the fact it took our husbands like nine years before they asked us to marry them.  When I mentioned it she laughed politely and gave a knowing smile. Mrs Ibendahl explained how her son had a slight cold which developed into an auto-immune disease, which has meant he has lost the use of his legs. She said: Heaposs having ongoing treatment, it takes them a while to stop the pain, stop the disease progressing and for them to remember how to walk. Almost everyone makes a full recovery, it just takes time.  Upstairs in the hospital,the Duchess took part in a creative arts workshop led by the NPG, promoting health, wellbeing and happiness through art. The youngsters, all patients and their siblings, were colouring in their own stage sets which included a photograph of themselves on the stage. The NPG gives each child receiving care at the hospital a free book, Playful Portraits, to encourage them to spend their time on the ward enjoying creative activities. The gallery also brings in artists for regular workshops across Evelina, Great Ormond Street, Newham University Hospital and The Royal London. Kate first sat down on a table where artist Jessica Rosenfield was instructing the children.  Who is this here  asked Kate, pointing to a picture of a Kallum Stuart, six, who is being treated for kidney failure, and was accompanied by his twin brother, Blake. This is brilliant. Are you all friends here ’ She asked, looking round the table. What a treat it is for me to meet you all today. What a treat! I am so pleased. Kate then laughing responded to a ‘high-five’ from Kallum.  She asked Anna-Victoria: Do you have a picture of yourself  Oh yes, that’s you. Amazing. Whose necklace is that  Is that mummy’s  Anna-Victoria solemnly shook her head. Chatting with artist Jessica, the duchess remarked: It’s wonderful to see what art therapy adds. To be able to paint, to draw, to be able to tell your story. Moving to her second table Kate met Luke and Savannah, who was dressed in a pretty floral Monsoon dress bought especially for the occasion.  She touched Luke’s arm and admired his ‘war wound’ - a large scar he has as result of breaking his arm last autumn after falling off some monkey bars and having to have plates and pins inserted in. Does it hurt now  She enquired. Do you have to come to hospital a lot  Luke’s mother, Joanne Wheeler, , later explained that she discovered her son had a congenital heart condition in the womb and he was first operated on just five days after he was born. He still attends regular check-ups at Evelina and may require further surgery in the future.  This place saved my son’s le, it’s as simple as that, she told Kate. We would do anything for the staff here. In fact Luke, from Rainham, Kent, has managed to raise more than £, this year to donate towards the hospitalaposs work by selling the rag wreaths he and his sister make, doing a sponsored swim, auctions and standing with collecting boxes at The Oval . He said: We just really wanted to say thank you to her for coming and spending time here. She was really touched, I think.  I told her that I had the same birthday as her son, George, and my sister is four, like Charlotte. She said Charlotte would love to have the pink wreath up in her room. It would be amazingthey did that. Not many people get to see a princess in real le and she is going to be the Queen one day. It was really exciting.

He taught us how to cook and that’s how I became a chef.” Eleven-year-old vegan chef Omari McQueen, along with “maths whisperer” Francis Elive are two heroes to restore your faith in human nature. South London-born Omari was just eight when he started his own business, Dipalicious, selling vegan dips and snacks. It isn’t just his first steps towards an empire that are so uplting. It is also the magnicent way in which he represents himself. While so many exasperated parents are forced to switch off the wi-fi or confiscate Xboxes or PSs, Omari can be found in the kitchen, educating himself. “I’ve got dyslexia so I find it dficult to read food labels,” he said. “Sometimes I smell the ingredients before I know what they are. When I was learning to read, I used cookbooks to help me remember words.” At a time when so much about our kids these days is negative, Omari and his response to adversity are a breath of fresh air. “I was beaten up at school by a boy in Year ,” he said.

Lucy Stone was described as an incredible DJ who was at the top of her game, performing at prestigious clubs and hosting a drive time radio show. She flew  miles per day between her Abu Dhabi home and Dubai, worked long hours and performed at high profile events. The -year-old died from multiple injuries after taking a cocktail of alcohol and cocaine and jumping from a tower block balcony in Hampstead, north-west London, on September . Lucy flew into Heathrow the day after splitting up with her boyfriend of one week, called JJ, on September . But just a few weeks before that she had ended a five-year relationship with another man, Andre. The talented radio host, originally from Chelmsford in Essex, spent her final evening catching up over dinner and mixing decks with close friend and fellow DJ Katie Hopkins, known on the circuit as Katie Smiles. But she was reported missing the following day when she sent a WhatsApp message to her family that she was struggling with le with suicidal thoughts - and hours later she took her own le. Katie, who lived with Lucy in Abu Dhabi before taking on another contract in Doha in Qatar said Lucy had appeared exhausted but upbeat during their final evening together. She said the music industry they were both in could be a tough and lonely place and that she wished she had known how much it had affected Lucy. University friends attended Lucyaposs inquest at St Pancras Coroneraposs Court where she was said to have died from multiple injuries as a result of suicide. In her statement, Katie said: She was amazing. She was a shining light in my le and an irreplaceable friend. Her sudden death has shocked me to the core. She is such a great loss to me and her family. Lucyaposs career was incredible. She was on top of her game, working for the top clubs and promoters in the business. I know she was physically exhausted when she came to see me. She was coming to London for a week. She had split up with a guy she was happy with before. She seemed quite upbeat as usual for Lucy and she told me he had booked a night at a hotel in Shoreditch and would come to me on September .  I was blessed to spend the next  hours with her. We chatted and had dinner in my flat. We spent the evening together mixing on my decks at home. Lucy told her employer in the UAE that she would be off sick for one week after her split from new boyfriend JJ, which ended after one week on September . The pair began dating following Lucyaposs amicable breakup with long term boyfriend Andre in mid August, who she moved to the UAE with five years ago. Katie said: The guy had said something to her about her personality that she took quite badly. She also spoke of her amicable break up with her long term boyfriend Andre. I was not concerned with her welfare. She seemed like she was happy to see me. She was upset about the break ups she had had. She seemed fine. That was the last time I saw her. We told each other everything and the fact that she did not tell me how low she was feeling breaks my heart. I am still trying to come to terms that I have lost an incredible soul. The music industry that Lucy and I were involved in can be a lonely and tough le and I wish I had known how much it had brought her down. The following morning, Katie switched on her phone to find messages from Lucyaposs sister Charlotte who was worried about her whereabouts. Charlotte said Lucy had sent a message to her familyaposs WhatsApp group to say she was struggling with le and sent her bank details advising she had sufficient funds to pay for expenses. Katie said: This surprised me. I contacted the police but Charlotte said she had already informed them. I asked the man from a convenience store. He gasped and said aposis that the woman who jumped off the tower yesterday apos I was shocked and still am. Police came to my apartment late that day to say Lucy had committed suicide. Sussex and Met Police launched an investigation and made enquiries at London Marriott Hotels, where Lucy had access to free accommodation due to her job.  She was believed to have suffered from bipolar and depression and previously tried to take her own le with a cocktail of pills in . Police and the London Ambulance Service were called to an apartment block in Hampstead at around pm on September  to reports of a woman jumping from a building. Paramedics arrived within the minute and found Lucy with catastrophic injuries before an air ambulance arrived. She was identied by her tattoos and pronounced dead at the scene around half an hour later following CPR. Assistant coroner Jonathan Stevens expressed his sincere condolences to Lucyaposs family and confirmed the cause of death as suicide. He said: Lucy was a much loved, bright and talented lady. She had broken up from her long term boyfriend Andre and then had been in another short relationship which had broken down. She had been working long hours commuting hundreds of miles between jobs in the Emirates. She was tired and exhausted although when she saw Katie, she had put on a brave face. Although Katie had known her for many years, there was no inclination Katie could get that anything was wrong.

RSCPA Assured, the charityaposs sister organisation which producers register with to commit to higher welfare standards, says they have suspended Hoads Farm in Broad Oak, near Hastings in Kent, whilst they urgently investigate. It comes after DxE Brighton say footage filmed yesterday exposes disease-ridden conditions and piles of corpses left rotting amongst the living hens who deserve to have their voices heard. Footage allegedly taken from the farm in Broad Oak appears to show disturbing scenes of dead birds piled on the ground with feathers strewn everywhere. But a spokesman from Hoads Farm toldtoday: We are both shocked and saddened at the recent imagery linked to Hoads Farm and have launched a full investigation into all the allegations. The imagery is by no means reflective of the hygiene and welfare standards on any of our farms, in which we are held in high regard. We question both the validity and integrity of the images portrayed. We have had a fully qualied poultry vet visit the site yesterday and raise no concerns, apart from the consequences of the protesters actions. We have also requested an audit from the RSPCA Freedom Foods, which has now been completed and stated ‘the birds are in good health, with good feather cover’.An investigator for the DxE Brighton campaign group yesterday told Kent Live: “We visited Hoads Farm multiple times over six months. Many of the hens’ cloacae, from which their eggs are laid, were visibly infected, bleeding and swollen from forced overproduction. In the disease-ridden conditions, many piles of dead birds were found in the walkways among the living hens, and each time that we visited we found the same and new bodies decomposing. The dead will have died in pain, with many obviously trapped in the racks dying from starvation. The investigator continued: One night we found a hen huddled in the corner, motionless and shaking. She had blood all over her head, suggesting she had been violently thumped or stamped on by someone. She was in clear pain and shock and hadn’t received any veterinary attention. “About  months ago, we found that depopulation had taken place since our last visit - every inidual we had met in the months prior had had their lives taken from them in a slaughterhouse. The ammonia filled air and filthy shed remains with a new flock of , hens, who will also be killed in  months when they stop producing eggs fast enough.”  Animal welfare activists occupied the farm in East Sussex. At am today yesterday,  people dressed in full biosecurity filed into Hoads Farm. Six more people locked themselves to one another in heavy chains at the end of the farmaposs driveway with the support of more activists. The farm, owned by the Potters Yorkshire Farmhouse Eggs Ltd, was first established in  and, according to its website, values for animal welfare, high quality standards and sustainability underpin how the business is run to this day.  A spokesman for the farm confirmed the RSPCA and their own vets were on site to ensure all necessary standards are being maintained while they seek a peaceful resolution. Hoads Farm are fully accredited to RSPCA Freedom Foods welfare standards, according to their website. A spokeswoman for RSPCA toldtoday: We can confirm that an RSPCA farm livestock officer has visited the farm and the new flock of birds seen today was in good health, with good feather cover. However, our investigations are ongoing.A spokesman for RSPCA Assured earlier said: “We are shocked and appalled by this footage and we understand why people are upset. Any allegations of poor welfare issues on RSPCA Assured certied farms are taken extremely seriously, which is why we have suspended the farm whilst we urgently investigate.”  A spokesman for the RSPCA added: We have very serious concerns about some of the hens and the conditions shown. On any farm, it’s important that any sick or injured animal receives attention quickly and thatany birds die their bodies are removed promptly. “We would encourage anyone with concerns about animal suffering to report it to us at the time so we can take swt action.” A spokesman for Hoads Farm yesterday said: A group of around  people are trespassing in a privately owned free range hen house on Hoads Farm in East Sussex and are demanding the release of  hens into their care infor agreeing to leave the property. While it may be unintentional, the continued presence of such a large group is causing signicant distress to the hens as well as potentially compromising the biosecurity measures in place, and we are seeking a quick, peaceful resolution.  The police are in attendance to assist with the removal of the trespassers. All free range egg production is governed by EU legislation ensuring that the legal standards for free range production are met. Standards governing flocks producing Hoads Farm free range eggs are even higher, matching those of the RSPCA Assured standard and BEIC Lion standard. We have requested attendance on site today of the RSPCA and our vets to confirm all necessary standards are being maintained. However, all sites are routinely visited by independent bodies both announced and unannounced to ensure standards are maintained.

GymBox came under fire after a staff member told -year-old Elena Bunbury that reactions in the gym can be extreme when people are working out. The unknown worker added: It is an unfortunate situation where a guy was rude to you, but it could have happened anywhere. During the incident on December , Elena said the man had confronted her and her pal whilst they working out on the leg machine at the branch in Stratford, east London.  After complaining they were taking too long, he later ed and dubbed the pair pathetic before throwing weights on the floor and staring at the pair. In an email, she wrote: To say this was my first time at the gym, the unfriendly, judgmental, and aggressive attitudes have really put me off coming again. Now the shocked -year-old has shared the response from the gym online - which she said blew her mind. The full response said: It is unfortunate that you had such an experience in our gym. I have never had similar issues with members. I understand that what was said was inappropriate and rude. I have been working in this gym for  years and havenapost had any complain[sic] about [redacted]. I will bring this up with my manager and have a discussion with him. From my personal point of view, it is an unfortunate situation where a guy was rude to you, but it could have happened anywhere. We are in a gym where testosterone levels are high especially during workouts. This means that reactions to situations can be a bit extreme, especially for men. The email from the gym was retweeted hundreds of times after Elena shared it online. Speaking to the Mirror, Elena said she is now worried to- after signing up to a year membership at £ a month, and personal training sessions.  She said: Iaposve been working with a personal trainer too who I really like and have clicked with. But I havenapost been back to the gym to work out alone since this happened. I found it such a really weird response. First of all, with respect, I donapost care that a staff member hasnapost been harrassed by him, thataposs irrelevant.  The lack of remorse has left me really unhappy. Fellow social media users shared the post - with many criticising the response. One added: The fact thataposs the response from a staff member is very concerning. Good on you for taking it further. Hope the manager has more common sense and professionalism! Another joked: Next time Iaposm about to lose my temper I must remember itaposs fine because of my testosterone levels, instead of realising I need to calm down. A third person added: I’ve been a gym goer for over  years  can confirm that not once have I ever felt the need to harass or become aggressive with another customer.

Those required to answer questions or give evidence have a duty to comply fully - and that includes the arrogant Duke of York.Prince Andrew is shamefully accused by US prosecutor Geoffrey S Berman of “zero co-operation” with the FBI.The US agency is seeking to speak to him about his friendship with millionaire Jeffrey Epstein and the young women the now dead paedophile exploited. Andrew doesn’t appear to be the man of honour he claimed to be in that car crash BBC talk with Emily Maitlis. The Queen’s third child promised to help law enforcement. What we’ve got instead appears to be stonewalling. We demand the Prince immediately arranges to be interviewed.The monarchy exists only with public consent and this kind of behaviour could prove more dangerous for The Firm than rows about Harry and Meghan.The Queen must step in again and remind Andrew to do his duty and speak to the FBI. Never forget The Nazi Holocaust was one of the most evil crimes in history. We must never forget it so that it never happens again.

Simon Charles Dorante-Day from Queensland, Australia, says he was born when the heir to the throne and his now we were teenagers, but was put up for adoption. He has made the bizarre claims several times before but now says he has started legal proceedings in the High Court, Australia, to show the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are his parents. The -year-old is determined to prove he is second in line to the throne and says this is the most signicant step he has taken so far. Clarence House toldthey did not have any comment to make on the story. My grandmother, who worked for the Queen, told me outright that I was Camilla and Charles’ son many times, Mr Dorante-Day told New Idea. This is most explosive thing that’s ever happened to the palace. It’s definitely the most signicant step I’ve taken so far – I’ve had to force a deadline, hold them to a date, because we need answers.  He says he filed papers just before Christmas but court staff initially laughed at him. But now Mr Dorante-Day says a High Court judge in Sydney is assessing the case. He says he wants answers.

Shocking photographs show a woman with her face and body covered with a red burka, inflicting a series of lashes on another woman who kneels on the ground, hands clasped together and covered in a white burka. A blue sheet on the ground is the arena for the medieval punishment, as a crowd of men in unorm watch on - including one who appears to be a medic. Indonesia is the worldaposs biggest Muslim-majority country and Aceh, its westernmost province on Sumatra Island, is its only region which imposes Sharia - Islamic law. A common punishment is a flogging with a rattan cane and this brutality will often be meted out for such things as aposmoral crimesapos - such as gambling, drinking alcohol - or being an unmarried woman caught in a hotel room with a man. The public whipping was traditionally carried out by men, but more and more women are charged with the so-called aposmorality crimesapos, as modern citizensapos behaviour clashes with the entrenched norms of the deeply conservative region. This has led to an all-women flogging squad to be set as Aceh authorities say it is Islamic law for women to flog women. A similar situation can be found in neighbouring Malaysia. But as Indonesia opens itself up to the rest of the world, and with greater internet access allowing citizens to engage with human rights activists, there has been outrage about the practice and convincing women to join the flogging squad has not been easy.  Even Indonesiaaposs president has publicly called for the floggings to stop - but he has little power over Aceh, which agreed an autonomy deal in  after decades-long battles between the government and a separatist insurgency which demanded to follow religious law.

Banda Aceh Sharia police chief investigator Zakwan, who uses one name, said: I think she did a good job. Her technique was nice.

However, the -year-old is dferent – he hides a superhuman talent in plain sight.The Dundonian, a sixth-year pupil at Harris Academy, loves all things Dundee United – especially star man Lawrence Shankland – and relaxing with his friends.He’s also a talented swimmer. A rising star in the pool for Dundee City Aquatics , in fact. vw, px\"  Jack is the same but he is also dferent. On the autistic spectrum, he competes as a para-swimmer for the club, Scotland and Great Britain.You look at him and you wouldn’t necessarily think this unassuming, affable young man could be a Paralympic champion in the making.Yet that is his goal. And, once he gets to talking, you soon realise he has an iron will and a fire inside him that seems like it could crush any challenge that comes his way.“I feel likeI didn’t have autism I wouldn’t be me. I just find that really odd,” he told Tele Sport.“Being on the spectrum has its ups and downs but, overall, it makes me who I am.“I’m happy not to be treated dferently because some people see the disability before the ability and that’s quite sad.“It’s the same thing. A Paralympic medal is just as good as a medal at the Olympics, a world record is a world record. It’s the exact same thing, we’re just a wee bit dferent.“I’m focusing on my exams, that’s the main priority, but I’ve got the British Para-Swimming International Meet in April. vw, px\"  “This year it’s Paralympic trials. Hopefully, that’s making the team for Tokyo or seeing how close I am to the team. If I don’t make it this time, I’ll know for  where I need to be, what times I need to get and then work towards it.“When you hit , you go into the senior phase and it gets harder so I’ve room to improve before then.“It’s quite surreal because I was used to being a junior and now I’m competing with world record holders which is tough but it’s fun to test myself against them.”And, with the support of his family, club and the Scotland and GB set-ups, he’s had a bit to deal with.Being fielded with derisory questions over his eligibility to be a para athlete because he is able-bodied, being turned away from training with other clubs, living with his autism diagnosis and battling physical illness are all obstacles he continues to hurdle time and time again. Proven by his list of honours. vw, px\"  They are not limited to being Scottish champion, multiple times, a Tayside Schools champion, a Scottish and British record holder for his style of choice – the inidual medley – and a member of every elite swimming programme going.From close to home at the Institute of Sport and Exercise at Caird Park to travelling for the GB Para Academy, Jack is rightly an inspiration for young disabled people on Tayside.Winner of the Jenny Wood Allen Memorial Trophy at last February’s Dundee Sports Awards, he is defending that crown at this year’s ceremony at Caird Hall next month.And his advice to those thinking about taking up swimming is sage.“Swimming is a sport that is accepting of everyone. It doesn’t matter your gender, race or disability – it’s just a case of giving it a go.“If it’s not for you then that’s fine but you don’t know until you try.“You could just be a skinny six-year-old like me, confused, not knowing what to do and then end up becoming a champion.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/SNS-19792685-Dundee-Utd-Media-Access-940x520.jpg ","title":"dundee united out to show their credentials tonight against hibs in cup replay","story":"Peter Pawlett says Dundee United are determined to show their Premiership credentials at Easter Road tonight.The runaway Championship leaders face a dferent sort of test as they travel to a Hibs side sitting sixth in the top flight.With a place in the fth round of the Scottish Cup and a tie against BSC Glasgow up for grabs, the Tangerines head to the capital on the back of a -game unbeaten streak.That included the first meeting between the sides at Tannadice, where United fought back twice to level through first Lawrence Shankland and then Louis Appere .Despite holding their top-flight opponents, Pawlett reckons the Tangerines can play a lot better this evening.He told the Tele: “Tonight is a big game for us and one we are all looking forward to.“We want to show what we are capable of and get the right result. I think we can play better than in the first game – there is always room for improvement.“Once the game settled down, we showed we could cope. They had their spells of pressure, we had ours.“There was a bit of uncertainty over how the first game was going to go but,we show the confidence and belief we have done over the past few months, show how good a team we are, then, hopefully, it will work out the right way.“We’re confident. We know it will be tough but we can get through.”At the weekend, United prolonged the impressive run of form that’s seen them avoid defeat in all competitions since the middle of October with a last-gasp header from Lawrence Shankland .That came after the Tangerines trailed a stubborn Morton outfit for more than  minutes as it seemed their unbeaten league home record was at risk.Pawlett, though, says he was always confident they would level things up.He added: “We’ve been in good form and we want to stay unbeaten for the rest of the season.“Shanks popped up again and saved us on Saturday but I always knewwe kept plugging away it would come.“We were delighted to get the point in the end and results went our way where, so it is a point gained in the big picture.“We’re  points clear, we’re in a strong position, but we just need to focus on keeping results coming and, hopefully, win the league.”It’s not the first time United have trailed going into the closing stages of matches this season.Stoke eye late move for Shankland, joining interest from Rangers, Celtic and QPR\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp shankland-continuing-to-attract-interest-as-stoke-eye-a-late-move embed # secretRRWBZHkWm\" data-secret\"RRWBZHkWm\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"And Pawlett reckons that character shown by the players could serve them well tonight heading to a dficult venue.“Against Arbroath earlier in the season at Tannadice it was a similar situation to Saturday,” he added.“Unfortunately this time we didn’t get the three points but we kept our unbeaten run going.“At the end we showed our character and belief.“We want to get the job done. The club needs to be in the Premiership and we are determined to do that.”The Hibs clash last weekend was Pawlett’s first for United since getting injured very early on against Partick back in October.The winger’s time at Tannadice has been stop-start due to injury problems and yet again on Saturday he had to limp off. vw, px\"  It’s nothing to worry about, though, insists Pawlett as his time out of the team caught up with him.He said: “Yeah, I was fine. I’d been out for  weeks so I’m just getting my fitness back and I got a bit of cramp on Saturday. I feel fine.“Slowly but surely I’m getting myself right.“The ankle feels fine and that’s the most important thing.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/KCes_Craigie_High_School_Police_Incident_Dundee_200519-14.jpg ","title":"major shake up of education in dundee to be debated as plans to merge craigie high and braeview academy unveiled","story":"A massive shake-up of education provision in Dundee has been unveiled by council leader John Alexander .The far-reaching proposals brought forward by Mr Alexander and his administration would see:Subject to consultation, a new £ million superschool, merging pupils from Braeview and Craigie, could be built at the former St Saviour#s High with a projected opening of .Braeview was ravaged by fire in September . The blaze was described in council reports as #catastrophic# with #around % of teaching rooms signicantly damaged#.Mr Alexander said: #There is a real need for improvement in the east of the city.#We have spent £m since  and invested in new schools and that is not including the £m spent on existing schools.#But we cannot afford to build two brand new schools.#The plan,we get agreement for a full consultation, is to merge Craigie and Braeview Academy.#We are looking at what happened in Fe after a fire when there was a merger with a college. We see this as the way and Dundee and Angus College would be involved in taking this forward, with enhanced provision.#Both these schools are grade C in terms of quality and both need upgrading but looking at the financial elements we cannot afford it.#The priority is in the east and we cannot have Braeview Academy people sitting in portable cabins.#Mr Alexander, a former pupil of St Saviour#s High School, outlined how #vocational partnerships# between Braeview and Michelin would be continued at the new campus at Drumgeith Road.He added that a joint project between Dundee City Council and Dundee and Angus College would be launched to accommodate people with additional support needs.Mr Alexander said: #I spoke with three executives from Michelin and we are really focused on making things work.#The consultation,approved by committee on Monday, would start on February  and run until the end of March. We have to be honest with the public and we want the feedback from parents.#This is the very start of the process. And as a parent your focus is absolutely on what is in the best interests of your children.#Part of the consultation process will be looking at proposals for Craigiebarns to be part of the catchment area for Grove. That would take effect from August , so again there is a lead in time to give people the time to give feedback.#He told how boundaries are to be changed to help accommodate the uneven mix of schools which are under capacity and those which are over capacity both in primary and secondary.Turning his attention to the over side of the city, Mr Alexander said: #The re-alignment catchment areas for Harris Academy would remove Invergowrie and they would go to school in Perth.#Meanwhile, the future of a  much-vaunted new primary is also hanging in the balance — at least in the short-term.The council leader hinted that he understood that was likely to be a controversial decision.#We have also had a very detailed analysis of how many pupils in the area of Western Gateway and which schools they go to,# Mr Alexander continued.#There are  pupils on site , but we need to address the other issues with the priority being at the east end of the city, so Western Gateway is not a priority. This is not the time to do it and we cannot construct a primary school on the basis of  pupils.#We are not saying no to the school, but it is just not the right time now. We understand there is an expectation.#"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/dundee-morton.jpg ","title":"pars not getting carried away as they close gap","story":"Dunfermline manager Stevie Crawford insists his side won’t be getting carried away as they closed the gap to Dundee and the promotion play-offs to one point.The Pars’ - win over the Dark Blues on Friday night moved them to within a point of James McPake’s men in fourth .The Fers dominated at East End Park as Ryan Dow and Kevin Nisbet goals gave them a vital three points after five games without a victory.However, Crawford said: “We’re not getting too carried away.“I keep saying it and, I don’t want to sound boring and repetitive, but you can win a couple of games in this league and be looking at the play-offs then lose a couple of games and you’re looking at relegation.“The boys have worked extremely hard, bought into it and, when questions are being asked about how our season is going to go, to a man they deserve an enormous amount of credit for the way they performed on Friday.”The Pars boss reserved special praise for striker Nisbet as he hit his nd goal of the season amid reports Rangers and others are monitoring his progress as the January transfer window draws to a close.Crawford added: “He’s playing with a lot of confidence, scoring goals and he will attract attention. vw, px\"  “It’s a good problem for us.

All week we’d been really positive so we need to go back and build on that for the next game.“I think I showed them my game – bit of pace, drop the shoulder and get a ball into the box.“Cutting in and having a shot as well, that’s the type of player I am.“I’d been playing with the U s at Wigan, Dundee came down to watch me in the Liverpool game a couple of weeks back.“I done well, we won the game and that’s where the interest came from. I’m really happy to be here.“I don’t know much about Scotland or the league but I know it’s a really competitive ision.“Hopefully, I can make an impact by getting a few goals and assists.” vw, px\"  Although not clued up on the Scottish game, Crankshaw is no stranger to the blood and thunder approach having cut his teeth in non-league football after being released by home town club Preston North End and then Morecambe.His route to Dens Park has taken in such footballing-hotbeds as Ramsbottom United, Clitheroe, Colne and Curzon Ashton but Crankshaw believes that has made him the character he is today.“My pathway has been dferent to a lot of other players but I think it shows that I’m hard-working, dedicated and just want to play football really,” he added.“Most people come through the youth ranks but I’ve went my way and it’s a little bit dferent.“Hopefully, I can get where I want to be and have a career in the game. I’ve seen the worst of it but I think that builds you and carves your career.“It builds you as a player to not take anything for granted. You can drop out of the game but,you work hard, you can make it back.”Given their toils of late in the Championship, Crankshaw believes that drive to turn things around is something the Dark Blues can employ to get their season back on track.“We need to find some consistency. I think we’ve definitely got the squad to go and push for promotion.“We need to put a run of games together and get back to winning, where Dundee should be.”He has been made to feel at home in Dundee despite not knowing many people, and is even flat-sharing with back-up goalkeeper Calum Ferrie, as he gets used to the city’s football culture.“All the squad have been really good with me, introducing me to everyone.“I came up late Thursday night and the manager met me. He’s been really good with me.“Everyone’s made me really welcome so, hopefully, we can get back to being confident and up there. We’re willing and I think we will do.“I don’t know many of the lads but they’ve all been really welcoming so it’s been really good.“I’m friends with Cal so I’m staying with him in the flat so he’s been making me tea and stuff!

It is understandable that BT periodically reviews usage.”She encouraged local residents to take part in the consultation on whether the Stonehaven phone, which was not used at all last year, is still needed in the community.She said: “The box is in close proximity to the defibrillator on the nearby RNLI building. This could be one reason for wishing to keep the box operational.”Two of the most used payphones on the list are in Banff and Inverurie. The public phone on Castle Street in Banff was used  times last year, while the one on Market Place in Inverurie was used on  occasions.Councillor Glen Reynolds, who represents Banff, said: “I hope that in tourist hot spots like Banff, an iconic box would survive the cull.“The traditional red cast iron boxes may be listed, of course, so we need to think about them in the wider context of where they are andon balance they are an asset or a liability.“While the Castle Street payphone is not a traditional design, it still serves a purpose and is used signicantly.”A BT spokesman said: “Most people now have a mobile phone and calls made from our public telephones have fallen by around  % in the past decade.“We are consulting with Aberdeenshire Council on the removal of  phone boxes in the area, providing the community the chance to comment on our proposals.“As part of the consultation we are also offering communities the chance to adopt traditional red ‘heritage’ phone boxes for just £ through our Adopt a Kiosk scheme and transform them into something inspirational for their local area.“The need to provide payphones for use in emergency situations is also diminishing all the time, with at least % of the UK having either G or G coverage.“This is important because, as long as there is network coverage, it’s now possible to call the emergency services, even when there is no credit or no coverage from your own mobile provider.”For more information on how to adopt a kiosk see bt adopt"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.47961859-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.47961859-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.47961859-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/2.47961859-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"how you can take part in aberdeens spring clean","story":"Aberdeen residents have been called to action to help rid the city’s streets of litter.Environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautul is inviting people to take part in its annual nationwide Spring Clean.According to the group, litter levels remain at their highest recorded level in a decade and they want Aberdonians to help.With the  Spring Clean attracting more than , people, the charity wants even more people to register to take part this year by arranging their own event during April and May.Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We are all rightly proud of Scotland’s dynamic towns, villages and cities, as well as our beautul beaches and green spaces.”To find out more and register your activities to make them count this year, visit keepscotlandbeautul.org springclean"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/SNS-19808363-St-Mirren-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"042ex2801eea_story__8","story":"New signing Matty Kennedy insists he can handle the pressure of sharpening Aberdeen’s blunt attack.Dons boss Derek McInnes pushed through a deal understood to be worth £, plus add-ons to land the winger from St Johnstone.The -year-old Northern Ireland international squad player had already agreed a pre-contract to join the Dons in the summer.However, McInnes was so desperate to secure Kennedy’s pace and creativity he moved to land him now.Kennedy is determined to repay that faith by creating and scoring goals to haul the Dons out of their scoring rut.He said: “I can handle the pressure.“I want to prove I’m a good player, create chances for my team-mates and score goals.“I’m confident so I don’t mind a bit of pressure.“Even though it was my first game I still wanted to get on the ball.“I felt I could have got on it more, but I won’t shy away.“It is good that the manager has faith in me.“I’ll do my best in every game and the pressure doesn’t faze me.”On Friday Kennedy became the second major signing of the window when he penned a three-and-a-half-year contract until summer .He insists the stability of that long-term deal will give him the environment to thrive.Kennedy said: “I’m looking forward to the next chapter. I’ve spent a lot of time on loan.“I had a two-year contract at St Johnstone, but I am really settled here now with a three-and-a-half-year deal.“I play better when I’m settled, rather than being punted out on loan here and there. I’m happy to be here and it will be even better once I get my fitness up.”Kennedy is still short of that full match sharpness because prior to signing for Aberdeen he had not played since before the Premiership’s winter break.Crucially, he missed St Johnstone’s - Scottish Cup defeat of Morton and is not cup tied for the competition.Kennedy will be free to face Kilmarnock, the club where he began his career, in the fth round at Pittodrie on Saturday February .Despite not playing for Saints since the - draw with Ross County on December , Kennedy was pitched straight into the starting line-up by McInnes.The winger revealed his frustration at St Johnstone and admitted he didn’t knowhe “was coming or going” during the window.He wanted to play – and even went to discuss his omission with Saints boss Tommy Wright hours before Aberdeen pushed through the deal to secure him.Kennedy said: “I was delighted to make my debut. There was a lot of speculation and I didn’t knowI was coming or going at St Johnstone, so I’m just happy to be here.“I’d only trained once with the boys and the gafferthrew me in, so I was delighted to get  minutes under my belt.“I’d not played since the last game before the break so it was good to get my fitness up.“It was a bit frustrating. St Johnstone obviously wanted to keep me.“I didn’t play the last two games so I was delighted to get it out the way.“Tommytold me he’d like to have played me, but he wasn’t going to until it was all sorted out either way.“I actually chapped his door the day I went to Aberdeen because I didn’t know what was going on and I said I wasn’t happy not playing.“We had a bit of a laugh about it, to be honest.“He just said it wasn’t fair on the boys or on me, maybe it was affecting me a little bit.“He just said he didn’t knowmy head would be right.“I told him it was and it didn’t matteror when I’d be leaving, I wanted to play.“St Johnstone did a lot for me, as did Tommy. I wanted to play every minute.“Tommy was great for me, he was a really big part of me going there and I enjoyed working with him day in, day out.”Some of the near ,-strong travelling Aberdeen support at St Mirren vented their frustrations, with chants calling for manager McInnes’ head.In the aftermath of the draw, McInnes admitted he was “gutted” to hear those chants.Kennedy, though, was oblivious. He said: “I didn’t hear any of that stuff so I couldn’t comment. But Aberdeen are a big club and they expect to win every game. It didn’t happen on Sunday, but hopefully now we can kick on and pick up the three points most weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

That was a turning point for us. Irsquove investigated it, and there will be a number of people charged on the back of this.ldquoWersquove also deployed patrols throughout the town through December including the Community Action Team and community policing, and wersquove had officers coming down from Edinburgh to do patrols when we werenrsquot available.ldquoItrsquos had a signicant effect and Irsquom pleased to say that the youth and disorder calls in December in Peebles have reduced by  percent so itrsquos a really good result.

We can offer a crime prevention service to seewe can improve things around the football club.\"There are mobile CCTV cameras but we have to go through a process to get those as they are quite highly sought after.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France.

Christmas time had been dficult because it was the first Christmas without her granny, who had died earlier in the year. But now she was back at school and into the routine with her friends.Her parents had hoped this would help, but her sense of loss was still overwhelming for her. Perhaps at her age she didnrsquot understand exactly what was going on inside, but all she knew was that her granny shersquod loved was gone and she missed her.Then one evening during a bedtime story, Jessica started to cry and told her dad that her granny was melting like a snowman. At first he wasnrsquot sure what she meant, but then he understood.Jessicarsquos memory of her granny was fading. This was a second loss for her. The first loss was of her grannyrsquos physical presence, her actual hugs, her voice and care and love, even the smell of her perfume. Now Jessica was losing her memory of all this and she knew it. So she felt that something inside her was melting too, something that had been so much of her was vanishing.And this made Jessica fear that others in her le could disappear and then melt away as well, even her dad or mum. It was a terrying thought and it made her not just sad but scared and insecure inside.Her dad tried to reassure her that he or her mum werenrsquot going to die, but despite being only six years old, Jessica now knew that such promises couldnrsquot be kept forever.ldquoNana didnrsquot want to die either, but she did. And now shersquos melting.The next day at school was another dficult one for Jessica, and home time often didnrsquot make it better because in the past it had usually been her granny whorsquod picked her up.Her dad was waiting for her.ldquoWe are not going straight home today, he told her.ldquoWhere are we going ldquoTo Nanarsquos seat.A cloud suddenly came over Jessica. She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

It isntThe Commons chamber echoed with the voices of celebrity Remainers, like Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Rory Stewart. They are all now in the wilderness. Gone, too, the flag-waving fanatics outside the Palace of Westminster. BBC political presenters no longer have to compete with the megaphone cries of ldquoStop Brexit!.Well, no-one is going to shed any more tears about all that. The Brexit debate turned into a toxic culture war which had very little to do with the real issues of trade and citizenship. Everyone was too busy calling each other Nazis and racists or unpatriotic appeasers.Now the Withdrawal Bill has finally passed, everyone has lost interest. Itrsquos about boring stuff like trade. Yet it marks a historic defeat for the Westminster parliamentary system. The endless procedural wrangles and court actions of the last three years were in retrospect a huge waste of time and intellectual effort.But itrsquos worse than that. Wersquove been left with a legislative horlicks far more damaging than should have been the case. The Withdrawal Act is essentially Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit Bill, but without the ious concessions offered to Labour, without the Northern Ireland backstop and, most important, without parliamentary oversight.The protections on workersrsquo rights and the environment have been removed from the legislation, as has the idea of a regulatory level playing field. Protections for refugee children have been scrapped, along with other Lords amendments.The option of an extension to the transition period, due to end in December, is now ruled out by the Act. The much-debated Political Declaration is shorn of any legislative signicance.MPs will have no say on the negotiating mandate in the coming trade talks. Parliament will have no role in scrutinising the future trade deal.And thatrsquos not all. The ldquoHenry VIII provisions allowing the Government to change laws by secondary legislation, bypassing Parliament altogether, have been beefed up. The courts will not have to abide by the letter of EU law during the transition period.Itrsquos a comprehensive power grab. The Scottish Parliament will not be getting its ball back any time soon. Those powers over agriculture and the environment will remain in Westminster, evenresponsibility for administering them will be ed to Holyrood.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"description\": \"Brexit:  days until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media smEEaug poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests smEEaug.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Glasgow City Council to write to Prime Minister on Scottish IndependenceIf the entire UK had remained aligned with the single market, Scotland might have found a halfway house. But Brussels has now ruled out Scotland getting similar concessions to those granted to Northern Ireland. They wonrsquot even talk about it.None of this was inevitable. Under Mayrsquos deal, had it gone through in amended form, Parliament could still have been a major player in Brexit. For three long years, MPs had the power and authority to shape the Withdrawal Agreement ndash but they blew it. Now, Boris Johnson can do whatever he wants.Labour were largely silent this week, probably out of sheer embarrassment. They must know that they helped to make leaving the EU far harder than it need have been. They placed opposing Brexit higher than making the best of Brexit, so they ended up with the worst.It was common knowledge that most MPs favoured a Norway-style option of remaining in the single market while leaving the political institutions of Europe. Hard Brexiters might have complained that joining the EEA was a sellout, but Irsquom pretty sure voters would have accepted staying in the single market as the most sensible short-term solution.Voters werenrsquot bothered about free trade but about sovereignty and identity. Brexit wasnrsquot about erecting tarfs but curbing Brussels bureaucracy. It wasnrsquot really about immigration either. Boris Johnson is already relaxing immigration rules.And evenNorway proved unacceptable, there could have been a Swiss solution, which basically involves accepting the rules of the single market without actually joining it. This was really what Theresa Mayrsquos Brexit deal was moving towards.It sought ldquofrictionless trade by keeping the closest possible relationship with the EU.Her Irish backstop would have kept the entire UK in regulatory alignment with the single market.But the opposition parties werenrsquot having it. The SNP which had argued cogently for Norway plus for two years, suddenly turned into hardline Remainers.The Liberal Democrats went full revoke with disastrous consequences for their leader, Jo Swinson. Labour refused to accept the compromises offered by Theresa May last spring.Remainers thought they had Boris over a barrel that he couldnrsquot reopen the Withdrawal Deal. But he did. His backstop leaves Northern Ireland as a regulatory colony of the EU, but it was undeniably a new deal. Labour condemned it on the grounds that it abandoned Northern Ireland, even though theyrsquod previously claimed the PM was in the pocket of the DUP.Johnson has wasted no time demonstrating that he is not in the pocket of Donald Trump either by backing a digital tax on Google and by refusing to rule out Huaweirsquos involvement in G. Labour claims that the PM intended to ldquosell the NHS to Trump and allow chlorinated chickens to take over the supermarket shelves now look ridiculous.I know this is not how many of my Remain friends on Twitter see it. To them, Brexit was all about fighting fascism and ldquonativism. But the talk of creeping authoritarianism, ldquodark money, Russian interference was a kind of paranoid displacement activity ndash an excuse for not coming to a sensible compromise.The devolved parliaments last week voted to refuse consent to the Withdrawal Act. But any leverage the Scottish Government may have wielded has been lost by the General Election result. Holyrood will now be sidelined in future legislation on fish and farming.This week, on the eve of Brexit Day, Nicola Sturgeon says she will give her latest timetable for independence. But the SNP has no answer to the new constitutional reality: it will now be arguing for independence outside the European Union rather than from within it.Wersquore out of Europe, and wersquore going to stay out for a long time. There will be no referendum this year or next. Brussels is determined to impose a draconian trade deal. Investment in Britain has stalled.And wersquoll have the indignity of going through the ldquoother passports queue at airports.

Both of us quickly fell in love with Scotland. Wersquove long considered ourselves adopted Scots. Our two daughters are Scottish to their core. That makes us very proud. Therersquos much to admire about this country and its people.When we arrived, new Scottish friends thought it funny that wersquod come to Glasgow to escape sectarianism. But to us, Rangers and Celtic and a few Orange and Republican flute bands and marches were almost laughable in themselves.If thatrsquos what the Scots called sectarianism, we thought, then wersquod nothing to fear. Though we always wondered to ourselves: why the hell did the otherwise intelligent Scots accept this ugly hangover from Ireland in their society But to us all that mattered was that the orange and green yobs werenrsquot gunmen. Football hooliganism wasnrsquot political murder. Back then, Scottish sectarianism was so mild, in my eyes, compared to what had gone on back in Northern Ireland, that it was almost invisible to me. And it remained that way for a long time.Now, though, something is stirring in the darkest recesses of Scotlandrsquos soul and itrsquos ugly. At the weekend, we had yet another display of sectarian hatred imported from my country and played out on the streets of Glasgow. There were arrests and a police officer was injured after a Republican march and a Loyalist counter-demonstration clashed.The parade was organised by the West of Scotland Band Alliance - ostensibly over Bloody Sunday. The far right National Defence League organised the counter protest. Hundreds of police were deployed. Missiles were thrown.Back in August there was a riot in Govan when a similar scenario played out - a Republican flute band was met by Loyalist demonstrators. In September, a police officer was injured following two Republican marches and subsequent clashes with Loyalist protestors.When it comes to the weekend marches, some will apportion more blame to Loyalists than Republicans because Bloody Sunday is seen as a good cause. Irsquod say this: calling for the truth about Bloody Sunday, and the prosecution of British soldiers involved in the murder of civilians, is the right thing to do. I support that fully. However, nobody needs lessons from Republican flute bands anymore than they do from extremist Loyalists. The messenger matters, not just the message.And as so many people from Northern Ireland who now live in Scotland think: why are these marchers, on both sides, bringing the hatred of Ulster here  Marchyou like, but do so in Belfast or Derry.I should lay my cards on the table. I come from a religiously mixed family, with a Catholic mother and Protestant father. Irsquom an atheist. When it comes to Northern Ireland I support neither side. However, politically, I do support the reunication of Ireland solely by democratic means. I detest the IRA as much as I detest the loyalist murder gangs that ruined my country.Irsquove also reported on the Troubles and the legacy of the Troubles my entire working le. Much of that work was about exposing crimes the British government committed. I hold a torch for no side. Irsquove had guns pointed at my head as a reporter, and death threats. Irsquove been attacked, kidnapped.I know the type of people attracted to the kind of sectarian demonstration which is becoming more frequent and more daring in Scotland. They arenrsquot good people. Theyrsquore dangerous. The ideas in their heads shouldnrsquot be let loose in society.Republican and loyalist extremists are in love with the romance of violence.I said earlier that I love this country, and I do - thatrsquos why I really fear the growing confidence and visibility of these people. Theyrsquoll take any opportunity to turn Scottish society into something dreadful.Last week, two protestors heckled Nicola Sturgeon in Parliament, shouting: ldquoHow many support the IRA in your party  The men were reportedly connected to the Progressive Unionist Party - which is linked to the UVF.MSPs like the SNPrsquos John Mason and Conservative Murdo Fraser have added fuel to a fire that needs no kindling. Previously, Mason apologised for saying some see the IRA as lsquofreedom fightersrsquo, and Fraser referred to Rangers as lsquothe Queenrsquos rsquo. Only fools flirt with the Devil.Recent years have taught us that anything can happen in politics. Extremists can emerge from the shadows before the public knows whatrsquos happening.In England, Brexit allowed extremist identities to flourish. Political opponents were disparaged as lsquotraitorsrsquo or lsquoNazisrsquo. We need to guard very strongly against extremists trying to hijack the debate over Scottish independence.Apart from some ugly scenes by loyalists in Glasgow in the immediate aftermath of the  referendum, the constitutional schisms in Scotland have been remarkably decent.However, those Republican and Loyalist extremists have been animated by the tensions between independence and the union. Theyrsquoll try to make this fertile ground for themselves. Scotland needs to stop them doing so at all cost.Many friends of mine from Northern Ireland who live in Scotland would ban these marches outright. I support freedom of speech and assembly, however - although, notit imperils public safety.If these demonstrations are a risk to safety then ban them. Nor do these marchers have any right to parade through the city. They can find another place to march. If they wish to march in a particular community then it should be incumbent on Glasgow City Council to ask every member of that communitytheyrsquore happy with such a demonstration. If a majority of locals are happy, then let the demonstrators parade in a local park.At every turn, box these extremists in, undermine them, challenge them, exhaust them - because these people want to take the society that Irsquove come to love very dearly in Scotland and destroy it, just the way they destroyed Northern Ireland many years ago.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"deeply-moving-testimony-importance-making-every-precious-moment-together","story":"Away from the vapid, make-believe world of social media of \"Friends\" and \"Likes\", out here in the real world, there is space for one, and certainly no more than two of the deep and meaningful relationships Mr Jamieson and his we Jean had clearly enjoyed.That he has continued to contribute creatively to the pages of the newspapers since the death of the love-of-his-le only last October is quite remarkable, his emotive and emotional essay must have been as dficult to compose as it was tough to consume, but perhaps it was cathartic for him As someone with a similarly seminal relationship dating back to , with a half-century hopefully ndash but not certainly ndash on the horizon, the fear of the loss of such a singular soul-mate is as terrying as it is a grim reminder that none of us is immortal.Mr Jamiesonrsquos words, distressing, depressing yet heart-warming and reassuring in equal measure should serve as a reminder to us all that, whilst nothing is forever, for as long as a relationship like theirs ndash and mine ndash exists and thrives, it is vitally important to make the very most of it, making certain to express onersquos true emotions, to make every moment together count, taking nothing, or no-one for granted.A very poignant and penetrating article, fine journalism, conveying important le lessons for us all as we and those we love reach the tipping point on the baggage carousel of le, and,there is any consolation to be had in such sad circumstances, there will be millions who, for whatever reason, have never experienced such true and unalloyed love, respect and affection.Mike Wilson, Longniddry."},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-licence-fee-outdated-says-john-sergeant","story":"The ex-journalist, , said other means of paying for BBC programmes ndash such as subscription, programme sponsorship or even advertising ndash should be considered.He made the comments as BBC boss Tony Hall prepares to step down as director-general in the summer after seven years in the job.:Lord Tony Hall to step down as director-general of the BBC"},{"url":null,"title":"rare-swordfish-sighting-waters-off-east-coast-scotland","story":"The creature was identied swimming through SSE Renewablesrsquo Seagreen offshore wind farm site by HiDef Aerial Surveying Ltd during digital aerial wildle surveys of the area.Ecologists studying the sitersquos video footage from August  noticed the shape of the fish, which was two metres long and was recorded close to the sea surface.@HiDefSurvey discover Scotlands nd ever Swordfish in the North Sea for @SeagreenWind for @SSE showing the power of digital video aerial surveys.

A year later, the US retaliated, imposing a  per cent tarf on imports of single malt Scotch whisky in the long-running dispute over EU and American subsidies to Airbus and Boeing.Speaking at a Scotland Office Scotch whisky reception this evening, Karen Betts, Chief Executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: ldquoOur message is clear: the UK and US Governments mustquickly to tarf-free trade.ldquoThe current disputes about steel and aluminium and aircraft manufacture have nothing to do with us but the tarfs stemming from them are causing needless damage to our industry on both sides of the Atlantic and to the livelihoods we support.ldquoConstructive negotiations must solve trade disputes tarfs on whiskies will not, she declared.ldquoExports each way are markedly down andthese falls are maintained over the year around poundm is likely to be lost in Scotch whisky exports, explained Ms Betts.She said many smaller Scotch whisky companies were asking themselves how they could continue exporting to the US, whether they could build up alternative markets, and,not, how their businesses would cope.ldquoUntil a resolution is found, it is critically important that the UK and Scottish Governments act to mitigate the impact of tarfs on Scotch whisky producers, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which are being disproportionately hit.ldquoA cut to excise duty in the March Budget would help businesses strengthen their presence in the UK while exports to the US are under such pressure, insisted Ms Betts.Alister Jack, the Scottish Secretary, hosting this eveningrsquos reception in Dover House, said: ldquoThese tarfs are not in the interests of the UK, EU or US.

Scotch whisky exports to the US have grown  per cent, and American whiskey exports to the UK have grown  per cent since zero-tarf trade was introduced  years ago.He added: ldquoWe need to get back to zero-tarf trade which benefited distillers on both sides of the Atlantic so our industries can go back to doing what we do best distilling amazing whiskeys and sharing them with the world."},{"url":null,"title":"last call to nature fund applicants","story":"Nature enthusiasts are being encouraged to submit ambitious ideas to improve habitats, safeguard species and tackle the causes of bioersity loss.Applications are being invited for the latest round of the Bioersity Challenge Fund .But anyone applying will have to be quick – applications for this round must be received by midnight on Monday, February .

I was surrounded by a phenomenal group of kind and supportive people from all walks of le who had me laughing through every mental and physical challenge the wall had to give us. The views are so breath-taking no photo can do it justice, the challenge pushed me past my limits and rewarded me in ways I never expected.“I learned so much about the Chinese culture and had the adventure of a letime. I made the most amazing memories and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone , I will cherish every moment for the rest of my le and feel privileged to have been had this experience and to have raised funds and awareness for CLAN at the same time.”CLAN head of income generation and business development Fiona Fernie commented: “We are so grateful to everyone who undertakes challenges to raise money for CLAN.“We never underestimate how hard people work to raise money for CLAN and it is rewarding to hear when our supporters have had really positive experiences doing so. CLAN receives no statutory money from government bodies, and our services are completely funded by the work we and our supporters do.“In , we saw a % increase in the number of people who came to us for support, and so we need even more people to join us in fundraising.“The group that went to China in October had the adventure of a letime and the money they raised will go towards providing wellbeing support and services for people affected by cancer across the north-east.“Taking part in a challenge such as the Great Wall of China can be daunting so we are delighted to welcome the team from Global Adventures and some of ’s participants who I know will share their enthusiasm and help build excitement for the  trek.”For more information please contact fundraising@clanhouse.org or visit the CLAN website.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Primary School pupils with the cooking team and their special guests at the kitchen opening event\"  School celebrates new kitchen viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"ScotRail has launched a new campaign encouraging people to stop and think about their own personal safety while travelling or at work.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet. That alone should give Ministers pause for thought and allow more time for alternative options to be explored”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to Government briefings written up in the Scottish press, this will involve a “major push” for a second independence referendum. Appearing on TV at the weekend, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that his party would seek to “mobilise public opinion” behind a fresh vote.Of course, this will come as no surprise to anyone in Scotland: mobilising for independence is the SNP’s raison d’etre. But far from developing our national horizon, I believe the SNP’s approach this week shows just how limited its ambition really is.I have made no secret of the fact that I fear for Scotland’s future, and that of the whole UK, under Boris Johnson’s Conservative Government. I fear as well for the future of the planet unless we seize the initiative and act radically and justly now.: Ian Blackford: Independence is a ‘beacon of hope’ for people in Scotland: Scotland needs home rule - Gordon BrownBut when I was invited to set out my vision for Scotland’s future to the Citizens Assembly of Scotland the weekend before last, I knew that fear alone is not enough – nor should it be. Because the people of this country look to politicians for hope – for an alternative – andwe cannot set out a roadmap for change, we may as well step aside.So I spoke of my vision for a Scotland that is more equal, more tolerant, and free from fear: fear of poverty fear of homelessness fear of hunger and the fear of physical squalor amidst the huge inequalities of wealth.Tories and SNP inflaming tensionsAt the Golden Jubilee Hotel in Clydebank, where the assembly is sitting over a series of weekend sessions, Professor Chris McCorkindale and Dr Alan Renwick set out the constitutional framework which we inhabit. And then John Sturrock QC introduced the  of political speakers by setting out the constitutional debates which currently occupy us so much. Each of us made a five-minute pitch to the assembly members, who have been chosen from the ranks of the public to represent Scotland in all its ersity. But when the microphones moved to the floor, there was a marked change of mood – with citizen after citizen calling on the politicians to address the social, economic and environmental challenges facing our society.The focus of these contributions reinforced something I have felt for some time: that the public discourse on Scotland’s future is upside down. I oppose Scottish independence because I firmly believe a Home Rule settlement within the UK would offer us the best opportunities for transformative change. And I am energised by this prospect now more than ever because I believe that the visions for Scotland proffered by both the Tories and the SNP will only inflame the isions in our society – not resolve them.But far too much of the debate, whether at Holyrood, on election campaign trails, or on the pages of our newspapers, treats constitutional settlements not as means to ends, but as ends in themselves. A desire for changeI accept that Labour’s message on both Brexit and Scottish independence did not cut through last autumn, and we are actively discussing this as part of a review into our defeat. Butwe are to be honest with the people of Scotland, we must resist the temptation to applaud either Boris Johnson’s “get Brexit done” message or Nicola Sturgeon’s call for a second independence referendum, simply because both were electorally successful.For it is apparent that on December , Scotland voted for change. Scottish Labour needs to reflect on why the people of Scotland no longer see Labour as the vehicle for their ambitions to transform society, but it would be a mistake to see these ambitions as simply constitutional. I met voters who told me they were opting for the SNP to challenge the Tory Government, to defy the political establishment or to stop Brexit.And so it is no good for the SNP to be summarily dismissed as a party of the right masquerading as a party on the left – accurate as that may be. We cannot get away from the fact that many voters – including large numbers of former Labour voters – have turned to the SNP to articulate their desire for change. And I believe that Home Rule within the UK could allow us to make many of the changes that SNP voters want to see, particularly in making Scotland a fairer society in which the Government intervenes to support our public services and grow and reform our economic base, not least in using the considerable powers which already rest with the Scottish Parliament.Bringing Scotland togetherAnd much as the SNP presents independence as a panacea, it is clear from their own so-called Sustainable Growth Commission that it would exacerbate – not reverse – many of the injustices of the past decade. The party’s economic blueprint, by their own admission, would yield ten more years of cuts. Supporters of independence tell us that need not be the case, that after separation we could chart a dferent course. But surely it’s the other way round: the SNP should be setting out the kind of society and economy it wants to create, and its constitutional offer should follow. If that’s the society and economy that the Growth Commission sets out, then perhaps independence is the way to create it: but that’s a startling lack of aspiration from a so-called party of Scotland.I’ve been told that at a time of constitutional polarisation, our vision for Scotland is not workable, but I firmly believe it is the only way to bring our country together, rather than further entrench the isions of the past ten years. Andearlier generations had not possessed vision, and campaigned with conviction, there would be no NHS, no welfare state, no equal rights, no Open University, no full employment, no publicly owned housing.

Meanwhile, also send the data to Inverness, and have them monitor and log on how many occasions and for what duration the data received is either interrupted or of inadequate quality.If the system is as resilient as HIAL claim, they have nothing to worry about or hide, the local controllers will have no complaints about using monitors instead of looking out the window, there will have been no data interruptions to Inverness, and any deterioration in data quality will have been minimal. However,serious shortcomings are evident, a controller only needs to raise the blind to regain actual vision and immediately rescue a situation.Bosses say their communications system has been affected, and that engineers are on the scene working to remedy the situation.# Well, that#s OK then.

This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks!

While he still enjoys the banter over the counter on a daily basis, hes made himself a local social media personality with his popular posts ranging from the daily headlines to his chatter sparking reminiscences about the confectionery of yesteryear. Editor Des Blackadder sat down with Eugene this week to hear just some of the stories he has to tell after four decades in his Broughshane Street shop.You could say that Eugene Diamond got his start in the newspaper industry and hes been associated with it for most of his adult le.Born in the late s in a long demolished row of mill workers cottages in James Street in Harryville, Eugene is one of nine children - three girls and six boys. Which must have been a tight fit in the James Street days.I was a baby when the family got a move to the houses in the Demesne Estate, just across the Braid River from Harryville. If you ask me I would say it was perfect place to grow up .. we had the ruins of a castle literally at the top of our estate and a forest pretty much on our doorstep!The neighbours were great people and there were lots of children growing up in the Demesne at the time. We used to have great fun making huts up in the woods - which we called the forest - just beside the old Intermediate School site. One of my best memories is making a hut under the pedestrian bridge over the Braid which led to the Ballykeel One estate - we could hear the people walking across above our heads and we thought we were some boys because they didnt know we were there! Innocent days indeed, laughs Eugene.There was no easy pocket money in those days so Eugene had to earn his by delivering newspapers around the sprawling Ballykeel Two estate which had been constructed in the late s.That was my first job in the newspaper business, recalls Eugene. I got the job with the late Tam Johnston who had premises at what used to be known as the Ballykeel One shops. He was a gentleman and his shop will be well remembered by the older generation around Ballykeel and Harryville.Having attended St Patricks High School, Eugenes first real job took him to the Murphys Bottling Plant which was sited just off Railway Street in Harryville.Always on the look out for an extra few quid, Eugene took on a weekend job serving in a clothes shop in the centre of Ballymena.That was me into the retail sector - and it was a great time to be in the clothing trade. A guy called Brian Close owned the shop which was called In-Gear. It was just at the corner of Bryan Street and Church Street - the same building occupied until recently by David Bellingham.Things went well and he offered me the post of manager so I left Murphys for good.It was an era of glam rock, outrageous stars and some outright fashion disasters.Top of the Pops more or less set the style. When the Bay City Rollers hit the heights their tartan striped half mast trousers and skinny college style jumpers were huge sellers especially with the girls.Most guys round Ballymena were pretty much content with a pair of jeans, a gingham shirt and a Shetland wool jumper. Younger lads wore a lot of Wrangler denim known locally as the Wrangler suit of jacket and skinner half mast jeans.I remember the night that David Essex appeared on Top of the Pops wearing a grandad shirt - the next day there was a huge demand for the style, we couldnt get enough of them!Bryan Ferry more or less brought the elegant suit back into fashion when he and Roxy Music made a comeback just after the punk era had faded. Guys all wanted the double-breasted suit with turn-up trousers at the time, he recalls.Eugene chuckles when I ask him about the fashion disasters he encountered.I sold an awful lot of velvet jackets at a time, he recalls. Black, blue, bottle green. They were very popular but I bet the guys who bought them wonder why when they look back.Then there was the parallel suit - I can remember the favourite colour was electric blue. Basically it was a sports coat worn with matching extra width trousers. You could have sailed the Atlantic with themyoud nailed them to a mast!But denim was, without doubt, the major seller in Ballymena and a controversial advert for one particular brand meant that Eugene found himself in the eye of a publicity storm which made headlines far and wide.In those days dferent shops were linked to a certain brand - for example Sam of Sams Boutique had what was effectively the Wrangler dealershipI remember. Edwin Maternaghan was another big name in fashion retailing locally and he had Brutus.By now the name of In-Gear had been changed to Bananas Boutique and we were selling Easy Jeans and a new product called Jesus Jeans.They had a full colour poster of a well-proportioned lady squeezed into a pair of Jesus Jeans with the slogan He who loves me, follows me. We put it up in the window and it was a marmite job - people either loved it or hated it! One religious group based out in the country started a petition about it so we started a counter petition in the shop.It was the time when Ballymena couldnt appear in a news story without the words Bible Belt being added on - around the same time you had the ELO showgrounds story making headlines too.While Eugene enjoyed the fun times at Bananas, he can well remember one of Ballymenas worst days of devastation during the troubles when Church Street was blown to smithereens by an IRA bomb.It was on Friday, May ,  and I remember I was chatting to a friend outside the shop when a police car raced up and an officer told us to clear the area because there was a bomb in a post office van parked in the street. I had got round to Wellington Street and was talking to my good friend journalist Lyle McMullan.I said to him theres a story for you and because there were so many bomb hoaxes in those days he replied onlyit goes off.With that the lower end of Church Street just lted. Ive never felt or seen anything like it before or since. It was a scene of utter devastation which people who lived through it will never forget. One of my vivid memories is how dficult it was to get re-opened - the shop had very distinctive rounded windows and it took a long time to get new glass  made by Pilkingtons. And of course a lot of people will remember the bomb damage sales which took place in the aftermath.When Bananas closed its doors in , Eugene reckoned it was time for a change of direction and when he came across a small shop for rent in Upper Broughshane Street he decided to take the plunge. It was called the First and last because it was the first shop on the way into town and, coversely, the last as you were going out!I had started off delivering papers as a wee boy and now I found myself in behind the counter of a paper shop, he said.”My first rent payment was pound a week.”Forty years later hes still loving the job - despite a horrying early .am start!Sure its only seven days a week, laughs Eugene.In those  years, Eugene has witnessed the high points of the newspaper market when titles like News of the World sold by the barrow load.You couldnt explain to todays generation just how huge the NOTW actually was. People might have bought the quality Sundays but they also bought the NOTW eventhey did tuck it inside the Sunday Times! Of course they were caught out in some abysmal practices and that cant be forgiven but they did break some enormously important stories too. I still have some NOTW publicity material on a side wall of the shop. It may well be the last such material still on display in Britain but I keep it there to remind of just how big the newspaper print industry was at the time.But selling papers was only part of Eugenes role and he was a past master at stirring up some publicity out of all proportion to the size of his tiny shop.Back in the early s I took a punt on getting my own Ballymena Rock made up by a firm in Newry. People thought I had lost the plot because everyone associated rock with seaside resorts and not a town like Ballymena. Thankfully local people loved the idea and I had a great sale on it. Quite a few bars were sent overseas too, he laughs.The ieties of sweets and chocolate bars Eugene has sold down through the years is staggering.In fact, Ive come to the conclusion that people here have the sweetest tooth in the world! If you want to start a debate in Ballymena all you have to do is ask someone what their favourite sweet of all time was.Im a diabetic so I dont do many sweets but I have a good knowledge of wnhat the public wants and to this day people will travel from all over the country to buy a certain brand of toffee or an old style boiled sweet which I stock. Sweets especially are memory jerkers and they have tremendous nostalgia value. If it gets people talking and laughing sure its a good thing. How many times have I heard stories about someone losing a filling to the old Rileys Toffee Rolls  And yet they still came back for more!And does he have a personal favourite Cinnamon Lozenges all the way, he says. As far as I know they are more or less an Irish-only sweet because people come in all the time and take away a few bags full to friends and family in other parts of the world.Talking about local flavours, Eugene says he still has regulars who come specically for the bottled minerals.You would not believe the number of people who still swear by Kali water! And the younger generation will have absolutely no idea wnat Kali Water is but older people will probably be remembering the day they took a drink of it by mistake.If digital technology is our pathway to the future then it is a time machine which works both ways and Eugenes nostalgia posts about old sweets on social media have been delighting the local public for the past few years.As one who was steeped in newspapers I was a latecomer to twitter and facebook but time waits for no man so I decided to embrace it. To be honest Ive had some great fun thanks to social media. People love the old pictures of products and just love to tell you their stories of why they loved a particular brand more than others, says Eugene.The recognition by the National Lottery reflects sales which have raised more than pound. million for good causes down through the years. As one of the last old style newsagents the award is well deserved and theextends its best wishes to Eugene as he embarks on his st year in the trade.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mclaughlin pays tribute to reds second half hunger","story":"CLIFTONVILLE boss Paddy McLaughlin paid tribute to his side’s second-half effort in their dramatic injury-time County Antrim Shield comeback win against Ballymena. The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"register now for the craic 10k st","story":"BELFAST’S First Citizen was onhand to officially launch the annual SPAR Craic K.Set to kick-start St Patrick’s Day celebrations on March , thousands of runners are set to take part in the urban run which is celebrating its sixth year.Lord Mayor Danny Baker told the Andersonstown News that he will counting down the race as runners go through their paces.“I will be starting the race and as much as I would love to take part I have a sore knee at the minute and that’s my excuse,” he laughed. “This is a huge event for the city and I’m delighted that a portion of the funds raised will go towards Marie Curie cancer charity.

The UK has chosen to become a third country, to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, to leave behind the EUs framework of common rules, common supervision and common Court of Justice,\" he said.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet\"It has chosen to create two regulatory spaces. This makes frictionless trade impossible. It makes checks indispensable.\"He said the checks had to take place somewhere.\"As the whole point of the protocol is to avoid a hard border and protect the all-island economy, it was clear that they could not take place at the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland,\" he said.\"The only real option was to use Northern Irelands other entry points. This is also where such checks are the easiest to implement. And controls will also take place in Dublin and other EU entry points.\"Mr Barnier said negotiating the future UK-EU partnership would be a huge challenge. \"A new clock is ticking,\" he said. \"Eleven months is extremely short. Prime Minister Johnson has said he will not extend this period. This means that the UK will leave the Single Market at the end of this year.\"The EUs ambition is to create a close economic partnership. One that is based on a level playing field. That is the only way we will be able to achieve a truly ambitious deal. A deal that benefits both sides. A deal that - evenit will never match what we have now - lives up to our ambition to remain the best of friends and allies.\" Mr Barnier told his audience how on a personal level \"for many reasons\", he regretted Brexit. \"I will always continue to believe that we are better off together than alone - especially in todays world. That is why I will remain a patriot and European,\" he said.\"But I will also always have profound respect for the UK, its people, culture, great leaders - such as Winston Churchill - and its solidarity with the rest of Europe during its darkest hours.\"That is why at the beginning of this new chapter of European history, I would really like to wish the UK well - speaking here in Northern Ireland - as it embarks on this journey.\"Mr Barnier said he was pleased to meet Northern Irelands political leaders jointly on Brexit as his previous discussions with them had been conducted separately. He welcomed the restoration of devolution.The DUP and Sinn Fein did not appear together afterwards because of their dferences on Brexit, but Mrs ONeill said Mr Barnier was right to point out the risk of a \"clf edge\" come December ,a deal was not agreed.\"We are all very clear that we could come towards the end of the year and there could be a clf edge and we could end up coming out with no trade deal for the future,\" she said.\"Thats going to be catastrophic for trade patterns for the future - for many, many decades. Thats why we have the [Ireland NI protocol in the Withdrawal Agreement].\"Mrs ONeill said there was less than a year to negotiate the sort of trade deal that was usually conducted over a far longer time frame. \"I would be very concernedit is doable in the  months,\" she said.Mrs ONeill and Mrs Foster will meet with members of the UK Government and the devolved administrations in Cardf today to discuss the UKs relationship with the EU after Brexit. Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will also attend.Mr Gove said that \" will be a year of growth and opportunity as we level up across all four corners of the country and strengthen our Union\". He added: \"This has started positively with the restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland, and I look forward to seeing First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill back around the table today for the first time since .\""},{"url":null,"title":"19m for education as conor murphy reallocates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They faded and after a briefthey disappeared again. But now they are back, building from the foundations up. Club PRO Paddy McCann spoke to Michael McMullan, to trace their steps back into the world of club hurling. As a new decade turned earlier this month, Slaughtneil took the aristocrats of club hurling – Ballyhale Shamrocks – to the pin of their collar. Following the dramatic conclusion to an equally epic encounter, the Emmets narrowly missed out on qualication for Sundays All-Ireland final. But it was the subplot that struck an equally loud chord across Ulster. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Ballyhales players and their iconic manager Henry Shefflin were swamped by fans in search of autographs and selfies. A genuine outpouring of passion mixed with adoration. The glee etched across youngsters faces spoke volumes. In the recent past, its, perhaps, the biggest sign that the pockets of hurling across Ulster are alive and well. Bursting to get out. Witnessing it first hand was inspiring. Last November , another Kilkenny icon was in Ulster. It was a dferent brief entirely. Martin Fogarty coached many of the hurlings greatest. But in his role as hurlings National Development Manager, he was up in Drummullan to present medals to the underage players of St Finbarrs hurling club. googletag.cmd.push Two years after theirfrom the hurling wilderness, the clubs U team won the Ulster shield. They now unveil their plans for registration evenings later this month, giving Irelands national game another opportunity to spread its wings. And in the north of the county, Claudy are putting their roots down in search of another success story. For St Finbarrs, they have a heritage. In the late s hurling was played in the Loup area before the club was formed around the turn of the s. Of the three county finals they competed in the took the title in  and . They had quality players in brothers Liam and Colm Hinphey. John James McPeake, Sean and Francie Smith, M and Brian Mitchell. Patsy Donnelly. Joe McKee. S McGrogan. Henry McGlone. They also had Cork man Pat Russell in their ranks, who hailed from a club of the same name on Leeside. After the initial burst, St Finbarrs disappeared. It reformed later for a short time in the early eighties but ran out of steam before the newest dawn, when the wheels were set in motion for the club as it currently exists. Kilkenny man Brian Waldron, from Freshford, married Sheila Devlin and in recent years they settled in her native Loup. Their sons Odraacuten, Cian and Naoise hurled with Cuala and won Nicky Rackard Cup medals with Derry two years ago.   In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back. Paddy McCann  Brian, now the St Finbarrs Chairman, has hurling in his blood. He was involved with Kilkenny minors in the early noughties and, since histo Derry, has been coaching in seven of the local schools in the Loup area...spreading the gospel. The interest morphed into an informal meeting in January , that included Derrys Regional Hurling Development Officer Kevin Hinphey and Dunloy native Seamus Kane, who now resides in Loup. Kevins father Liam was part of the  St Finbarrs winning team. “Brian went around the local schools coaching and developed an appetite for hurling,” recalls St Finbarrs PRO Paddy McCann, one of the six at that initial meeting. “There was a group of us there at the start. Niall Lagan was there as well, his father also played on the  St Finbarrs team.” And so it began. Following Ogra Colmcilles withdrawal from the Derry junior league, they reached out to St Finbarrs, offering their premises base to help them build an identity. They are indebted to Ogra and to St Patricks PS Loup, where they host meetings. “The first night at Drummullan, it was like the build it and they will come sort of idea,” explains McCann of the new dawn in May . “We didnt really know who was going to turn up and when they called itthere was the guts of  youngsters...it was fantastic.” Now the club has over  members with  playing junior members. The players come from a iety of parishes in the South Derry and Loughshore area. The formation of the club has ensured access to hurling for all children in the area. It began with Us and earlier this month that cohort, mainly still Us, fielded the clubs first U team. “We would be expecting to field at U, U and at the younger ages. In Meadowbank, before we stopped before Christmas, we had two of the big pitches filled and two of the small pitches at the back,” McCann adds. “That would have been from Us, Us, Us, Us and down to Us.” Their growth has been helped by Brian Waldrons brainchild, the St Finbarrs Cup. A tournament played between the schools within their catchment area. Some field two teams, with eight or nine players in each. Its all about participation. “It is part of Brians work going around the schools, he organises it in Meadowbank and all the schools he was at would come in and play,” McCann explains. “It feeds into all the schools and for anyone showing promise and an interest, we can get them to play for St Finbarrs.” The Us and Us have had the privilege of playing at Croke Park in Go Games for the last two years. The youngsters are competing well and are going from strength to strength. The club achieved their first on field victory in October , when they won the Ulster U Regional Shield played against very competitive Letterkenny and Slaughtneil sides at Dungivens Kevin Lynch Park. At the presentation night, Martin Fogarty offered advice to carry on into this season, as they strive to grow. He emphasised the pride the club should take in passing on skills to the children and promoting hurling in the area. They had a blueprint for others to tap in to. “He spoke well about the club and he said he had heard about us,” McCann recalls of Fogartys address on the night. “Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example for other clubs.” Already this year, St Finbarr’s has made further strides with entry in the U North West indoor league. They have also entered teams into the U U Tain Oacuteg regional leagues run by Croke Park, as well as U league and Feacuteile. In their recent historic debut at U level, they gave a good account of themselves in a blitz that included Tyrone clubs Naomh Colmcille, Fintona, Belnaleck of Fermanagh and Dungloe. All with a  back-boned by Us. In any club, the people are the real assets. St Finbarrs are no dferent. Kevin Hinphey and Colm Dillon helped steer the coaching in the early days. The club described the input as immense but now the aim is to become self-sufficient. “Seamusand Brianare great for bringing people in. At our AGM, there were people volunteering that never played hurling to get doing coaching courses in it. “There is a lot of good will and parents are really buying into it. Some of the people are not really from GAA backgrounds.” It ensures that the future looks bright and their door is open to all new coaches and players, of all abilities. Everyone is welcome and there is always something to aspire to. Two years ago, three of the clubs U players represented Derry at half-time in their game with Down in the Christy Ring Cup. “They are holding their own. You would know they have started a few years later than other clubs but their skill levels are coming up,” McCann explains of how their oldest underage stars have progressed.   Other clubs he goes to, that are struggling for numbers with one or two people doing the work and getting burned out, he was using us an example. Paddy McCann  “There are a couple of guys and their skill levels are right up there with what other clubs have. We just dont have enough yet to be competing across the team but I can see them moving right up.” A club with championship tradition dating back to the s is back on the map. With continued efforts and promotion, maintaining their drive towards U and adult hurling is a target. As well as getting players through to Derrys Celtic Challenge team...and further. It would signy payback on a bigger scale and a chance for their club to grow further. For now, the Gaels in this corner of the county will continue to raise the bar. St Finbarrs registration for the  season takes place in Meadowbank on Tuesday, January  and Tuesday, February  at ..

He was always destined for success. His mother Catriona is an Ulster and All-Ireland champions camogie player, before moving into coaching where titles also streamed in her direction. Garys father Ronnie and grandfather George are steeped in motorbikes. On a dferent tangent, his sister Lara is both a champion gymnast and trampolinist. Sport simply runs in the family. For the  year-old St Patricks Maghera pupil, he has excelled in the world of motorsport despite only going into his third season in the saddle. Gary has competed on the Irish minibike circuit since its inception in , finishing second in the junior class, before graduating to the senior ranks last season. googletag.cmd.push In recent weeks, he was awarded the prestigious David Wood scholarship which the Motorcycle Union of Ireland awards to its most promising rider. It was won for the first time in  by Lee Johnston, winner of the last seasons Junior Isle of Man TT winner. He also took on the role of IMC Youth Ambassador – to act as a role-model for our younger members. “During this time Gary has shown maturity beyond his years, building up a great rapport with our Junior Members and his peers,” commented IMC Chairman Mark Boyd. “In addition to his abilities as a competitor, his positive attitude in success or defeat coupled with the clear commitment shown by both Gary and his family to his budding racing career bode well for his future. googletag.cmd.push “As Chairman of The Irish Minibike Championship I am privileged to recommend Gary for inclusion in the  BTC and wish him every success with the selection process.” His mothers reluctance stalled Garys career until just before his th birthday but she is now fully behind him since his early short circuit days. In , he progressed to the IMC Senior Open and Ulster Superbike Moto Championship. “Last year he was doing pit bikes with young kids but this year he went on to the short circuits and he was racing against adults, when he won the Moto championship,” Catriona said. “Now he is hoping to go to the British Superbikes on a Moto as well.” “As a rookie in the USBK Moto Championship, against some very experienced and older riders I came away with the title USBK Moto Champion ,” Gary outlined in his CV, which has been compiled with the view to attracting sponsorship for this season and a shot at the Moto class. The costings for next season could amount to over poundk, including a pound, Honda NSFR bike, entry fees and travel. “At the end of next year my aim is to make a wildcard into the Spanish Championship with my future dream to ride in the World Championships,” Gary added. He grew up watching and supporting both his father and grandfather in action on both the circuits and roads. It was no surprise to see him emerge from their shadows. His family helped him raise the funds for a trip to Donnington to compete in a round of the British Superbikes to help gather invaluable experience and a taste of what  could bring. MCUI Trainer and respected journalist and photographer Baylon McCaughey was full of praise for Gary. “Despite the cold and wet weather Gary, despite having only one season of tarmac racing under his belt in Pit Bike Racing, showed great enthusiasm and certainly was not afraid to ask questions,” he said. “After each session, he would enquire,he was doing the correct thing or not, and listened to advice given. “With plans to compete in the British Championships, I know this lad has the correct approach to his racing, his manners off the track, and competitiveness on the track, will certainly help him to achieve his goals.” Talent, with an attitude to match. Perhaps the greatest combination. If the next two years follow his meteoric rise since , Gary Scott is destined for greatness. Remember the name.

She was keen to help those in need and to get people involved.Making time for others, she had a listening ear and often offered advice in compassionate ways. She liked being at the heart of things, and she was the le and soul of the party.Helena, from the Crocknamohil Road close to Draperstown, went missing on November .She was last seen near the Foyle Bridge in Derry city.Her remains were discovered last Tuesday evening by search teams on the River Foyle, who had been scouring the area every day since her disappearance. Her family, including husband Declan and four children - Kayla, Ben, Kaeden andNiah-Rose - all aged from one to  years-old, had held out hope she wouldhome.On Monday morning they gathered with hundreds of others in a final farewell to the much loved daughter, sister, mum and we.Special recognition was given during the funeral mass from the McElhennon and McGlone families for the tireless, daily efforts by family, friends and strangers in looking for Helena.Passing on their thanks, Fr McGirr said: Over these past number of weeks Helena has been on the minds and in the prayers of countless people across our erse, good-hearted and generous community. Helena’s people also deeply appreciate the supportive messages from people conveyed across dferent s expressing their compassion and kindest thoughts.People were keen to help and pray for Helena. They have been opening their hearts and sharing their moments with a neighbour and people they’re feeling for. “They and the generosity of local businesses donating food for volunteers and family members also helped to draw Helena gently home.As sincere people and as a community of faith gathered here at St Patrick’s, we share our sympathy with everyone among Helena’s family and friends grieving her passing today. We also reach out to God to help and console us in our sorrow, and we pray to him for the happy repose of Helena’s soul in the le to come, because we would like her to have that peace very much.”Yesterday, messages of support continued to be posted on a Facebook page set up in the search for Helena.As well as offers of thoughts and prayers, messages lent support for her family and expressed relief that their agonising search had finally come to an end. Last week after news that Helenas body had been foud, her family thanked those who had left comforting messages. “Helena was a beautul person and earth angel. She’s now an angel in heaven reunited with our Daddy, goddaughter and other family members,” a Facebook post read. Helena is survived by her husband Declan and four children, her mother Mary and her siblings Rosaleen, Teresa, Michael and Sean.For emotional support you can call the Samaritans -hour helpline on  , email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Donegal County Council closed off the road to Lisfannon beach after signicant damage was caused due to the effects of Storm Brendan and ongoing erosion.Councillor Jack Murray said: “Unfortunately the road at Lisfannon Beach has endured signicant flood damage in recent days. “The council has responded and fenced off the immediate area for safety reasons. “Further to that, I have asked that it is cleaned up and repaired as soon as possible. There is some dficulty however in completing lasting repairs to the road as flood damage is a recurring problem with the location being very exposed to the elements. “The council will however liaise with all relevant statutory agencies with the aim of developing a lasting solution to this problem.“This is hugely important for the local community as Lisfannon Beach is an extremely popular tourist amenity and is much loved by local and visitors alike. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Rice Bowlclosed for a month so the owner could get married. But rather than put up a standard “closed” sign, a giant photo of a customer entering the takeaway was placed over the shopfront.  The owner – known only as Mr Chang – came up with the hilarious idea after an elderly neighbour said she didn’t feel safe without his customers about. Mr Chang, , ed from his honeymoon to discover a month’s-worth of very confused – and hungry – customers on his CCTV system. googletag.cmd.push So he decided to share the best of the clips on social media. The clips were captioned: “The award goes to the lady that tried to look through a window that is really not a window.” The series of funny clips show baffled customers scratching their heads as they try to gain entry to the shop. In one, a woman in a checked coat is seen attempting to push the fake door. After getting nowhere, she then attempts to peer through the  window and pushes her full weight against the wall. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has proved to be an exhilarating not just for the young people involved, but for their parents and the coaches. “Any sort of coaching is good but you get a better feeling from something as unique as this knowing that you are helping these kids,” McKeever said. googletag.cmd.push  Group pictured at the Football for Visually Impaired Kids held in Templemore Sports Complex. Included on left, is Danny Hutcheson and on right, Chris McKeever, coaches.  “Sometimes people are a bit wary of it, thinking that because there is visual impairment and because football is a contact sport it might not be the best thing, but the unique training and the way we go about this means that the kids are gaining confidence. “The parents see that as well and we are always trying to get more kids to come and join in to experience this.” At present, the Wednesday night session is the only class of its kind in the city, but with the right support, McKeever, Hutchman and everyone at Trojans is hoping that Visually Impaired football can become a permanent fixture locally.“Its unique to Derry,” Chris agreed. “I know there is Visual Impairment football in Belfast now and that has really taken off. “It didnt take off overnight however, it does take time and thats what were trying to get here. “We need as much support as possible. The parents are % behind us and they do see the dference to in the kids that come to us.“At the minute we rely on a lot of word of mouth. Weve been around a few primary schools and we have posters up. “We are promoting it also on the Trojans Facebook page but a lot of it comes down to word of mouth. We have also been to the RNIB and they have put a poster up in the eye clinic in Altnagelvin Hospital just so people are aware what is there for the younger kids.” A year in it may be, but the development of the scheme is still in its initial stages and McKeever sees great potential for the expansion of the class, not just locally, but nationally.“Our aim is just to give kids with Visual Impairment the same opportunity as other kids,” he explained. “In the long term we would love to get a league goingother teams were thinking about it as well. Theres no reason why kids with visual impairments cant get into football and learn the sport. “Im sure there are kids with us who have brothers and sisters playing for football teams and maybe they feel they cant do it because of visual impairment butwe can get a league going that gives everyone the opportunity. Hopefully that is something we can start to look at from the start of next season, maybe even having a friendly against the team in Belfast, just to get the word out there about it.” googletag.cmd.push Humble beginningsVisually Impaired Football first started over a year ago when Trojans coach Gerard Bradley was contacted by his sister Kathleen about the possibility of starting a class for her two children and others with similar challenges. Bradley wasted no time in getting to work and with the support of the Irish Football Association, who provided coaches, equipment and time, the first foray into the world of Visually Impaired sport in Derry began.Bradley is no longer directly involved in the coaching side, passing the baton onto McKeever and Hutchman but his experience in Visually Impaired football is one which has stayed with him.“We can taken everything for granted but its amazing what some of these kids come through,” he said. “The course is going grand and theres a good attendance every week. “We have specialist footballs which dont bounce but other than that its just normal football and normal coaching sessions. There are dferent kinds of vision problems involved. There are also glasses which imitates what someone with visual impairment sees and it really is interesting.” Sponsorship neededTrojans are hoping to continue the weekly classes and the help of a new sponsor will ensure that those local kids with visual impairments can continue to enjoy the benefits of their Wednesday night sessions. “Were keeping this scheme free,” Chris added. “We dont charge the kids coming down but we are looking for as much support as possibleanybody in the community wants to get in contact to offer support. Were trying to keep it a free scheme and were happy enough doing that butwe were able to get a sponsor on board that would really help everyone involved.”The VI football training takes place every Wednesday night, between  and pm at Templemore Sports Complex and is open to all children with a visual impairment.

He has since signed a deal at the club until the end of  season, and admitted that once McCourt reached out, he agreed to come to the Candystripes almost immediately.“This is a big step for me and hopefully I can restart my career here and of course bring Derry City as high as possible with some goals. The only thing I knew was Shamrock Rovers because they played in Europe against a Norwegian team. Its a big league which is almost quite as big as Norway so for me it was easy, very easy to say yes and when Paddy sent me the message I said yes almost immediately. I didnt know Paddy but I searched right away so I was a little star struck tright away,” he laughed.Nilson has one tenuous link to Derry City in that one of his former clubs is Fredrikstad, who used to have former City midfielder ciaran Martyn on their books. The striker though is determined that the league he knew little about will certainly remember him when he eventually leaves.“Hopefully the fans can expect goals from me,” he said. “I am all about the box kind of player. Of course I am an all around player but I love to be in the -yard box and thats where the goals are scored so I am going to be there all the time and hopefully I can score a lot of goals.“Of course every footballer wants to play as high as possible. The first step now will be to take Derry City as high as posiible. I have met everyone now and I am looking forward to the first game. It starts at the top against Dundalk andwe are going to end up top three then we have to win those games.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This can help tackle both the obesity epidemic and improve childrenrsquos overall health and well-being.The Active School Travelprogramme which Sustrans delivers has successfully increased the number of pupils walking, cycling and scooting to school, with the charity explaining that it takes on  new schools each year.However, it says the programme needs to expand and provide more long-term support to school communities in order to turn around these statistics.In the   period, the number of children walking, cycling and scooting to school in the AST programme increased from % to % while, at the same time, the number of pupils being driven to school fell from % to %.Cllr Walker says he is ldquoall for getting more children to walk to school, but explained that in some parts of Down District, this simply isnrsquot possible as in many rural areas there are no footpaths. In addition, he said there are no dedicated cycle paths.ldquoI fully support the work of Sustrans and have worked with the charity on a number of schemes in my own area, he revealed.ldquoI recognise that the more children who walk to school, the less congestion there will be and fewer cars sitting in traffic queues pumping dangerous fumes into the atmosphere.Cllr Walker said mph zones have been introduced outside some local schools, calling for such schemes to be rolled out across all council areas.He added: ldquoWith the emphasis now on people taking more responsibility for their own health and getting fitter, encouraging children to walk to school when it is safe to do so will sew the seed of keeping healthy from an early age and this will stay with them for the rest of their lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Delay.jpg","title":"Delay for development meeting on Irish Street  ","story":"AN event designed to provide business owners in Downpatrick with an input into plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings has been delayed.Originally scheduled to take place before Christmas the meeting was delayed in the wake of the snap Westminster election, with hopes that it would go ahead this month.Now it has emerged that it could be February or March before what is being viewed as one of the most signicant town centre regeneration meetings ever to take place in the district takes place.A number of Downpatrick councillors were recently given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear which will feature heavily in the proposed redevelopment scheme.The old police base enjoys protected status and therefore cannot be razed to the ground to pave the way for any new development. As a result, innovative ways will have to be found to include the building in the new retail scheme which could also include new housing.There are also some who believe that a multi-storey car park mdash with retail outlets on the ground floor mdash should be considered in the new development and built on top of the existing Irish Street car park footprint.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials have this week reaffirmed their commitment to work with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site, with the project being spearheaded by the Department of Communities.Council officials say that working alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal will provide consultants charged with coming up with a design on the way forward with an understanding of what local people would like to see and what would work at this particular site.Officials insist that there is little point developing options which they think might work, with the forthcoming meeting with all stakeholders designed to secure by-in from them and develop a project that is likely to succeed.The planned meeting with all stakeholders will help shape a development brief inviting potential developers to come forward to transform the site and kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.In addition, the development brief will outline what all those involved in the process would like to see happen in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have expressed an interest in the location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre.It is over two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative, with local council officials confirming recently that ious pockets of land which make-up the Irish Street site have now been purchased.Local councillor Dermot Curran said the recent visit to the proposed Irish Street development site provided an insight into its size and development potential.He is backing the move to involve businesses and residents in helping shape the development brief for the site and hopes that the planned meeting at which they will be asked for their input can take place soon.ldquoWhat we are talking about is the biggest ever investment in Downpatrick town centre. We have to get this right as it has the potential to not only regenerate Irish Street, but the wider town centre by attracting increased footfall which will boost existing businesses, many of them locally owned, said Cllr Curran.ldquoIt is clear that having viewed the Irish Street site that it offers massive potential and can transform Downpatrick town centre and provide a major boost for existing businesses.Cllr Curran said he has spoken to a number of business people who are keen to have the date of the meeting with consultants confirmed so they can attend to help play their part in shaping the future development of a prominent town centre site.He added: ldquoPeople want to see progress on this crucially important development. Redeveloping the expansive Irish Street site can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment and will provide a boost for existing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down senior footballers face tough opener  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS senior footballers head for Clonmel on Sunday more in hope than optimism to open their Division  Allianz League campaign against Tipperary.Paddy Tallyrsquos charges face a tough opening game as the Premier County, who were relegated from Division  last season, will be like a wounded animal and determined to bounce back into the leaguersquos second tier.The sides met last June at Pairc Esler when Down won an All-Ireland Qualier - to -. Pat Havern, Corey Quinn and Donal OrsquoHare did most of the scoring that day, but Tipperary will be a dferent proposition at the weekend.New Tipp manager David Power, who famously led the county minors to an All-Ireland title in , has an abundance of talent at his disposal, but he will have to without star player Michael Quinlivan.The Clonmel Commercials man has decided to go travelling for a year and his absence is a huge loss to Tipperaryrsquos attack and the countyrsquos bid to regain their status in the top flight ahead of next seasonrsquos championship changes.Promotion is also a must for Down as well, as they too have huge aspirations of avoiding competing in the All-Ireland second tier competition.Down have just emerged from an indferent McKenna Cup campaign.Wins over Fermanagh and Antrim were cast aside when Tallyrsquos team were given a reality check by Tyrone in the semi-finals.Mickey Hartersquos experimental side simply over-powered Down and had too much physicality all over the park.Hopefully, Down will have learned from that game, but second guessing Tallyrsquos team selection ahead of Sunday is a dficult job.Definitely missing Sundayrsquos game will be vice-captain Caolan Mooney, the one player in the camp who has the ability to stand out from the rest. His unavailability through injury is a severe blow to Tallyrsquos aspirationsJohn OrsquoHare and Marc Hynes shared the goalkeeping duties in the two McKenna Cup games, but Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns is still considered as the county number one.Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins, Burrenrsquos Kevin McKernan and Warrenpointrsquos Ryan McAleenan could well man the full back berths with Annaclonersquos Brendan McArdle also in the frame.A knee injury for Saulrsquos Pierce Laverty, picked up against Tyrone, could rule him out of action, but Daniel Guinness could well fill in for him at right half back. Captain Darren OrsquoHagan seems to be favourite to start at centre half back with a mixture of Ross Carr, McArdle, Mayobridgersquos Shane Annett and Guinness flanking him.Midfield has been a bit of a problem for Down, but Loughinislandrsquos Jonny Flynn should start in this sector with either Liatroimrsquos Liam Middleton, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan, Carryduffrsquos Owen McCabe or Longstonersquos Conor Poland most likely to get the nod.The set of six forwards will come from Poland, McCabe, Corey Quinn, Barry OrsquoHagan, Conor Maginn, Pat Havern, Donal OrsquoHare, Brendan Gallen, Ciaran Harney, Liam Kerr and Ross McGarry.Regardless of who Tally starts with, Tipperary will be no pushovers and now under Powerrsquos management, they will be keen to impress.Michael OrsquoReilly, Liam Fahey, Bill Maher, Robbie Kiely, Jack Kennedy, Conor Sweeney and Liam Treacy all showed up well in Tipperaryrsquos recent McGrath Cup campaign and did enough, even without Quinlivan, to suggest that they will be a tough nut to crack..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 22%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Rumours were re this week that it could be another ten years before the adoption of the poundm-plus scheme to provide a lsquoring roadrsquo in Downpatrick.Work on the scheme first started in the late sixties and, ironically, the Department of Environment is preparing to make a public announcement within the next two weeks on the route they want the road to take.But on Monday Downpatrick councillor Mr Eddie McGrady told a meeting of Down councillors that there were local rumours of another ten-year delay.Within the past  hours it has become obvious that the warning could take on realistic proportions.It seems clear that a wall of objections will be raised of the scheme and it could particularly take years to smooth out negotiations and pare the way for a pubic inquiry, which now looks inevitable.Mr McGradyrsquos warning came during a council discussion on a planning decision to refuse alterations and extensions to a dwelling in Saul Street, which is expected to be in the path of the new road.He drew the councilrsquos attention to a planning approval for squash courts in St Patrickrsquos Avenue mdash also likely to be in the path of the road mdash offering one explanation for the conflicting decisions.ldquoThere are rumours that planning permissions might be given in certain circumstances because it might be ten years before the road is implemented, he said.CROSSGAR mdash The st Crossgar Boys Brigade will represent Down Battalion in the Northern Ireland district finals of the squad drill competition in Omagh on Saturday.The Lissara boys qualied for the finals by wining the annual Down Battalion competition held at Banbridge on Monday night. Second was st Ballyroney, with st Raffrey finishing third.This is the most prestigious event in the Battalion calendar and a very high standard of drill was set by the locals, who have been practicing the movements for the past four months.Apart from the squad competition, there was also a squad commandant cup presented at Banbridge and Sgt M Cuffey, of Crossgar, was the winner.The overall competition was chaired by Mr D Partridge, Battalion president, assisted by Mr R Dickson, Battalion secretary.

They say they are simply removing mercury out of the rotating lens system and putting in a new ldquoinnovative mechanical bearing solution, insisting that the changes are not being driven by any

Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse continuing to provide an essential safety service for mariners as it has done since a light was first established in Killough in .During a public meeting last year to discuss the proposed changes at the lighthouse, CIL was urged by concerned residents and politicians to leave the lighthouse as it is and not to do anything to harm its heritage.There was also a warning that there would be ldquoructions at all levelsthe proposed changes were implemented, with several people pointing to the potential for the lighthouse to be transformed into a unique leading visitor attraction which would provide an economic boost for the area.Residents opposed to changes argue that Killough boasts the ldquofinest example of a lighthouse of its kind and that no one is in any doubt about the maritime history and heritage of St Johnrsquos Point and its uniqueness.Campaigners say that they are determined to protect the heritage of the lighthouse and suggest it is

potential to generate millions of pounds in tourism revenue.Typical activities in geoparks include the development of walking and cycling trails, training local people to act as guides, the provision of information signs and the development of visitor centres.Northern Irelandrsquos only other current geopark mdash the Marble Arch Caves which inhabits the rugged mountainous uplands and gentle rolling lowlands of counties Cavan and Fermanagh mdash contributes just over poundm to the economy in this area.Local council officials, who confirmed a pre-Christmas Recorder story that the formal bid for geopark status had been submitted, have revealed that an Area of Outstanding Natural Beautymanagement team for the three local areas has been created.Council officials say that they are continuing to work secure geopark status which is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism.But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious geopark designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with those behind the bid confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors in particular.But securing geopark status is not just about delivering financial benefit.Geoparks in other areas have empowered local communities, providing them with opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.If the local bid for geopark status for a huge swathe of land covering Strangford and Lecale, the Mournes and Ring of Gullion is successful, the international designation is expected to play a key role in helping transform the local economy.The geopark brand will use the geological heritage of the three areas to develop sustainable tourism that generates economic benefits, while providing recreational opportunities and increased awareness of the arearsquos natural assets, working with landowners, businesses and communities.The ultimate aim of a geopark is to enhance the economy and develop employment opportunities for the people who live there, but the global brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been

This year they donated a fantastic amount for the charities, said Raphael. ldquoI am delighted to see young people come on board to help others. They are a credit to their school and their families.Raphaelrsquos chance meeting with Martin, a homeless man living on the streets of Dublin whom he met during a visit to family members a number of years ago, was the catalyst for him to launch his annual appeal which has enjoyed tremendous community support.The photographerrsquos meeting with Martin underneath a railway bridge close to Pearse Street railway station had a profound impact on him, moving him to organise an appeal as soon as he ed home.ldquoThe sight of seeing Martin on Pearse Street back in  will be with me forever. To see homelessness on the rise across Ireland,north and south, means something is badly wrong. There doesnrsquot appear to be any political will to cure the problem. It there was, we would not have homelessness in a modern society. More needs to be done, immediately, said Raphael.Year on year the response to his appeal has increased and this year he will be looking for anyone interested in helping to get in touch to help with the collection, storage and distribution of donations.Raphael confirmed that he plans to launch his appeal for volunteers to join forces with him this October.ldquoI cannot begin to praise every single person who responded to my Christmas appeal. It was so overwhelming, he explained.ldquoAll I do is put the word out about my appeal and people come forward in great numbers to help. The response to the latest appeal was the biggest to date and I cannot thank people enough for their generosity and support.ldquoThe response from the public was truly unbelievable. I am particularly indebted to everyone, in particular, the staff and students at St Colmcillersquos High School.The annual appeal is particularly time-consuming for someone who runs his own business and that is why Raphael is hoping people will volunteer to help him in .ldquoEvery item that is donated has to be unpacked and checked to make sure it is okay to pass on. Then it has to be sorted, re-packed and stored until the time to deliver it comes. This takes up a lot of time and there is only so much one person can do, he explained.Raphael has also singled out the management and staff at Peter Fitzpatrick and Sons Estate Agents in Downpatrick for particular praise for allowing their Irish Street base to be used as a -off point for his appeal.ldquoThe business has been so supportive over the past number of years. I cannot thank them enough for all their help, he said.ldquoDePaul was over the moon with the items people donated and the fact that a signicant number of people took time out at Christmas to think of and help others is very humbling. If more people come forward to help me this year, together, we could do even more.In future Raphael hopes to deliver the majority of donations to more local charities and organisations. He said it only seems right that items collected are distributed locally so in future most of what he receives will go to local charities.He added: ldquoThe generosity and community spirit across the district is something to behold. All I do is announce details of the appeal and people across the community then donate in numbers.ldquoOnce the message gets out there, people are quick to respond and I am so grateful as are the organisations they are supporting.

You have to be able to adapt the set, you look around the room and see what vibe people are into. You have to be very engaged with the audience, read the people. “A lot of the time it’s old and young people so you need a wide range of songs for a wide range of people.Rory, Paul and Stefan with their award“It’s very satisfying for me as a singer to sing all these dferent types of songs. “I’m challenging myself to sing songs that put me out of my comfort zone.“If you want to be good,you want to get better, you have to step out of your comfort zone.”The wedding band that Paul sings with – Infinity – picked up the award for best band in Co Armagh Tyrone at last weekend’s Northern Ireland Wedding Awards.“I’m on a wee bit of a high after winning. You go to these things and don’t expect to win. We’re just about the music and doing a good job, but it was good to be recognised.”Paul, who plays guitar and sings is joined in Infinity by Rory Madden on piano and Stefan Kelly on drums.He said: “We’re very erse musicians. You have to be. We’re a new breed of wedding band. We’re trying to change it up a bit.MOT test temporary exemptions outlined by Infrastructure Minister to drivers whose certicates have expiredPolice thank public for their assistance after missing -year-old girlfound Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“I’d moved away for many years and then when I came back about five years ago I was still pushing the solo thing. “Myself and Rory had both worked professionally, but we saw an opening and said, ‘let’s start a wedding band together’. We’ve never looked back.“What we’ve been doing for the past four years is building Infinity up.“We play at a professional level. There’s no corners cut, we rehearse, we learn new material, we really intricately put songs together, work out first dances.” Askedbeing in a wedding band pays well, Paul said: “I can’t disclose that but we do okay. We put a lot of money back into advertising, into making music videos.” Paul lives in Aghalee where he has his own music studio: “I’m getting into the production of music – for the band, for myself and helping other singers. I’ve got a lot of experience as a singer so hopefully I can help others. I’ve loved being a listener as well as a singer.”As a producer Paul has put together a number of music videos for Infinity which the band use to showcase their abilities to potential customers, that is, brides and grooms to be.Not unlike the mainstream music industry wedding bands are trying to stand out from the crowd and land regular headline slots.Paul said: “The wedding industry is massive. There’s a lot of competition. We have to step it up. We’re always pushing to be better. “We make music videos so people can see what we do. One of the first songs we recorded was a cover of Ed Sheeran’s Perfect. People wanted to book us for their wedding because of that promotional video.“It put us on the map a little bit. Ed Sheeran isn’t all bad.“Perfect has been the most popular songs for a first dance in the last couple of years.”Discussing first dances, Paul said: “We have a massive repertoire of slow songs, hopefully the bride and groom pick something that we do really well. If not there’s the challenge of preparing a stripped back version of their favourite songs that’s suitable for a first dance.“That’s the thing about first dances. Sometimes you’re learning a song you’ll only sing once. “I remember being asked to do a rave song for a first dance. It was Set You Free by N-Trance. I thought, ‘phew, how am I going to do a rave song for a first dance ’ In the end you just have to look at the chord structure, slow it down. We did it with just piano and vocals, it was really pretty. I’ll probably never sing it again so I guess you had to be at that particular wedding.”He continued: “We’re looking all the time at what’s doing well, what’s popular, what are people reacting to, what kind of groove are people dancing to.“You can’t beat the old songs like Walk Of Le, Stevie Wonder, classic rock, Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top. Young and old know that.“In this part of the world you have country music, both American and Irish, and folk music that goes down well.“We leave Rock The Boat to the DJ.”Paul said he was just as comfortable being a wedding singer as he was as a solo artist: “I get to put on a nice suit and stand on a big stage in front of three or four hundred people.“It is great to be on stage and see all those people dancing, having the time of their lives in front of you.“You’re making it happen, that’s my job. That’s what we have to do, that’s what we strive to do well.“For me, what’s the alternative, to try and be a great artist and never make it  I’d rather be in the music business, be working as a musician, to me that’s the most important.“There’s regular work as a wedding band. We can be looking at  to  weddings a year.“As a musician I’ve done all sorts of gigs, sometimes you could be in a room of  people and those people could just be loving everything you’re doing. Other times it can be tough. I don’t mind because I love playing music.“Just because you’re playing a wedding doesn’t guarantee people will be up dancing. You become a good improviser, you need topeople aren’t dancing.”Paul said to be in a wedding band you had to rethink your priorities: “As a wedding singer you have to be adaptable. I can’t be saying. ‘this is what I like, I don’t care what you like’. It’s not about me, it’s about me trying to do the job well. The same for the other guys in the band.”He added: “It’s never completely comfortable. There’s always a bit of pressure. Then you’ve got the camera stuck in your face as well. You’re part of the wedding. There’s no room for mistakes.”Paul said that almost all his weekends were spent on the road with the band.He said: “Thursday to Sunday you’re out on the road and during the busier months of the year you could be doing a wedding on a Monday night, Tuesday night.“We do the odd full day wedding. I’ll sing an acoustic set in the afternoon then a big set at night. Those are harder and harde to do. If you’re doing three of those in a row you’re getting no sleep and your show’s going to be affected by that.“Most of the time we’ll do a two or two and half hour live show and there’s an hour disco from Rory afterwards. We find that we’re there for the whole night. That’s our usual package.“You play to am. You’re getting home at four in the morning a lot of the time depending where you’re playing. We do a lot of gigs in Donegal and Monaghan, Dundalk, Drogheda, down the Athlone, the Midlands area. It’s a few extra hours on the road, but we’ll not rule anywhere out.“It’s a le we’re well used to. What  would you be doing ”Reflecting on the change in his musical career Paul said: “As a solo artist who had management and was bringing out singles I just didn’t get lucky, it can come down to who you know and not how good you are.“I feel like I’m a better singer now, being in a wedding band, working so much and pushing myself so much to be good at what I do has made me better.“I feel more confident in myself now, people probably respect me a bit dferently as a wedding singer. I’m working all the time. I’m very dedicated to what I do. I don’t drink, don’t smoke.“What’s the alternative  Go and try to be the next Lewis Capaldi. Yes, you can try but the chances are you’ll be doing a gig every other week and have no money.”He said: “You need to leave your ego in the house, for me it’s just about going out and playing good music. It’s all about that crowd, making their day, making that bride and that groom and their family happy.“We’ve all been to those weddings were the band have been awful, it’s been a real drag. We striving to not be that band. It’s a wedding. People should be having the night of their lives.”Askedhe attending any weddings other than those he sings at, he said: “I’ve been at a few family weddings but I’ll be with the band. Infinity will play their wedding, that’s my gt to them.”He added: “I’ve never married. I’m married to the music. If I ever did I’d have to play my own wedding. I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. At the minute I wouldn’t even have the time to get married.”try catch  TrendingNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - gales now expected too as temperatures set to plummet to -degCPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall for next week - subzero temperatures expected across NINI snow alert: Snowfall and ice worse than originally thought - Met Office issue yellow status warning - temperatures to plummet to bitterly cold -degC with risk of gale-force winds tooTwo PSNI officers in hospital after horric attack        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"People\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan.

So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

The pupils were then asked to redesign the maps by using their knowledge of the local area. They identied key landmarks, short cuts and potential barriers to walking and cycling.The pupils also developed a set of symbols and a map key which will be used in the new map.Sustrans also held a parent engagement workshop where they invited families to identy routes that they and their children use.Sustrans will produce a bilingual pocket-sized travel map which will be available to students, staff and parents for free. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

January , : pm\"\"Parents are dipping into their kids savings to supplement day-to-day living costs, a study has found.Researchers polled , mums and dads and found one fth have borrowed money from their childrens piggy banks and accounts in order to pay their living expenses.Nearly half of those have taken cash out of their little ones savings to pay household bills, with  per cent borrowing money to cover the cost of groceries.And, ironically, more than one sixth have done so in order to cover childcare.The research was commissioned by comparethemarket as part of their latest Parentdex report on pocket moneyJody Coughlan, Money Manager, at comparethemarket said: \"Fortunately for kids, the wider squeeze on the household budget seems to have had little impact on the generous amounts parents wants to give their children.\"That said, parents do need to ensure that they are able to give their kids this pocket money, without needing to dip into it to cover wider household bills.\"The report uncovers the spending habits of British children who receive an average of £ a month, totalling £ every year and giving them the equivalent of £.billion to spend collectively.Research also found kids savings accounts are relatively healthy, with the average child having a signicant £. stashed away.In fact, one fth of children have £, sitting in their savings.It also emerged children are generating a second source of income, with four in five parents giving their offspring extra money to cover unforeseen requests such as new clothing or nights out with friends.These ad hoc requests see one fth of parents topping up pocket money once a fortnight, and more than a quarter giving these extra handouts once a month.Meanwhile, the Bank of Gran and Grandad appears to be another fruitful source of income for kids.One quarter of grandparents find themselves contributing to kids income, with two thirds giving their grandkids generous handouts as and when they see them.Unsurprisingly, children in the capital are the recipients of the highest amount of pocket money compared to anywhere  in the UK, with the average parent in London giving £ to their child each month.In contrast, children in the east of England are given £ a month while those in the south west who are given £.Fortunately, the poll also shows mums and dads are confident in their childrens ability to manage their finances effectively, with almost three quarters believing the youngsters will be well equipped to handle money as they approach adulthood.In the absence of financial education at schools, this could be down to discussions at home, with nine in  stating they have talked about money management with their children.However, parents clearly feel their children would benefit from additional teaching in schools, with four fths of those polled believing schools should do more to teach financial education.Jody Coughlan added: \"Its incredibly encouraging to see the number of parents who are willing to talk to their children about financial management from such an early age.\"Not only will this do more to prepare them for financial responsibility in the long run, but it should also help to lessen their long-term dependence on the Bank of Mum and Dad as a result!\"\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\"

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/edel1.jpg","title":"leaders in business edel doherty beyond business travel","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster BusinessEdel Doherty’s grand ambitions for her business travel firm probably should come as no surprise to those who know her – it’s a sector which she has worked in her entire le.A decade ago she founded Beyond Business Travel, a business with a £m turnover and around  staff. Now, the aim is to grow that to £m, which includes a new office in Dublin to expand its market reach right across Ireland.“We are hoping to take that to £m in the next four years and we have opened an office in Dublin,” she told Ulster Business.“It’s an ambitious target, but we have grown year-on-year for the past nine years and have brought a lot of technology into the business and to our clients.”The client list reads like a who’s who of the giants of Northern Ireland industry, including poultry processor Moy Park, Almac and Devenish Nutrition. The firm has also looked after those on the Game of Thrones crew.“We have a strong track record of getting and maintaining good clients,” she says. “We are a new breed of travel management company. We want to make a dference in client businesses. “People, the human capital, is what the business is and making sure they are looked after while they travel is a big thing for us – doing it effectively, making sure they have the support,  .“I’ve been in travel for more than  years and I’m passionate about it. It has changed dramatically, with the rise of the smartphone.”That includes the development of booking tools for clients, but also looking ahead and building more advanced technology, incorporating articial intelligence and being able to personalise the experience for each traveller. Born in Belfast, Edel’s initial career trajectory looked set for university, but instead she wanted to go in to the world of work, and tackle the travel sector.“I went straight into the industry and I’m a great believer in le-long learning. I want to be the best version of me and to reach my potential,” she says. That includes working across dferent areas of the travel industry. But Edel says business travel “was always my love”.Edel is involved with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Women in Business, as well as sitting on the CBI’s SME Council in London. She’s also just been named Businesswoman of the Year by Women in Business.And like many company founders, Edel hit the ground running with her own business as the world entered its worst recession in a generation. She was previously a director with a company for  years, before deciding to make the move and go it alone.“I made a business plan – I said to myself, I can do this, I know I can. I built a brilliant team around me, and almost  years later, here we are. It’s been hard work, but it’s enjoyable and I’m passionate about the Northern Ireland economy. I’m passionate about buying local.”As for Brexit, Edel says setting up the Dublin office was one was in which the firm was mitigating against any business concerns arising from Brexit.“It’s hard to plan when you don’t know. Business people are problem solvers,” she says. “Once we have a problem, we come up with a solution. But people are holding back on decisions. We did a complete analysis of our clients and they are down on last year. It completely filters down and there is a knock on effect and people are nervous.“A lot of our clients are exporters. If they are affected, everything from export documents, to the movement of goods and people – that willimpact.”Looking to the future and Edel’s ambitious £m turnover target she says leading the way in tech and being early adopters is helping to drive expansion.“We are looking out at what’s coming – some clients won’t work without technology, and we have tech bedded in. It’s tried and tested.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.
