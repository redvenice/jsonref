REMAIN","story":"Share this article        Last night the party\u0027s union paymasters swung behind a new vote, but left enough wiggle room for the party to still back Brexit. Leaders of organisations affiliated to the party agreed a set process to follow depending on whether the opposition is able to take power in a general election.They decided that if Theresa May\u0027s successor tries to take the UK out either without a deal, or with a Tory one, Labour should back a referendum with a choice between those options and Remaining - and back the latter.This is the position adopted by Mr Corbyn today. But if Labour wins an election - which some believe could take place in the autumn -  the party should offer a referendum with a choice between that deal or Remain. Trade union kingpins including Unite\u0027s McCluskey - a close confidante of Jeremy Corbyn - decided that in that referendum, whether the party backs Leave or Remain should \u0027depend on the deal negotiated\u0027.  This raises the possibility that a Corbyn government could theoretically negotiate a new Brexit deal with Brussels and then campaign against it in a new referendum.Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Tom Brake said the announcement meant Labour was \u0027still a party of Brexit\u0027.\u0027Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour Party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People\u0027s Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to Number 10,\u0027 he said.          Campaigners backing Chris Williamson gathered outside Labour\u0027s headquarters in London today ahead of a disciplinary hearing         Protesters gathered outside Labour headquarters in Westminster this morning where a party committee is considering whether left-winger Chris Williamson should be readmittedThe timing of the Brexit announcement will fuel accusations that it was designed to deflect from the anti-Semitism crisis engulfing the party.Protesters gathered outside Labour headquarters in Westminster this morning where a party committee decided Chris Williamson should face a new hearing over anti-Semitism claims.The Derby North MPs was originally suspended in February after he complained the party was \u0027too apologetic\u0027 in the face of criticism of the way it dealt with the issue.Last month a panel of the party\u0027s national executive committee ruled the suspension should be lifted after issuing a formal warning, prompting a furious outcry from MPs and Jewish groups.However the suspension was reimposed two days later after a threatened backbench and staff mutiny and one member of the panel, MP Keith Vaz, said he had been drafted in at the last minute and that he believed the decision should be reconsidered.Labour general secretary Jennie Formby has since referred the case to the party\u0027s disputes committee, which ordered a fresh hearing this morning.It comes as the party is braced for a major BBC Panorama investigation into anti-Semitism in its ranks.A number of former employees are reported to have torn up non-disclosure agreements to speak to the programme which is set to be broadcast on Wednesday. "},{"url":null,"title":"Footage shows hilarious moment father law mistakes doorbell cam retina scanner","story":"Share this article

in regard to holiday pay she is owed, taking the total payout to around £35,000.Mr Harris, 59, trained as an upholsterer in his family business and started Mark Harris Upholstery, now operating as The Foam Shop in Livingstone Way, Taunton, in 1986.He turned it into a thriving business, appearing in many of its online promotional videos, including one in which he is featured lying on a bed with a scantily-clad model.In it he says: \u0027Foam cut to size. I grant you, not as sexy as Roxanne here, but it\u0027s what gets me out of bed in the morning.\u0027         Harris, pictured with model, was said to have become infatuated with employee Lorraine Shoton who danced provocatively with him one Christmas partyMs Shotton, a former police officer, joined the business in 2013 as a part-time clerical assistant, but rose to become general manager just 18 months later, the tribunal heard.She was \u0027not above flirting\u0027 with her boss, the judge said, and she told the tribunal that Mr Harris at first \u0027was charming, funny, complimentary and we became friends\u0027.But by November 2016 she wanted to bring things back to a purely professional footing.She complained that her boss had \u0027gradually introduced\u0027 unwanted touching.\u0027He would spontaneously kiss me, stroke or sniff my hair, put his hands inside my clothes, sexually hug me, sit me on his knee, ask for sexsexual favours,\u0027 she told the tribunal.         Mr Harris trained as an upholsterer in his family business and started Mark Harris Upholstery, now operating as The Foam Shop in Livingstone Way, Taunton, in 1986The tribunal also saw a diary entry by Ms Shotton, claiming that her boss offered \u0027to come round my house for tea when his wife away, bring a takeaway and cuddle on the sofa\u0027.She drew a line during a November 2016 meeting, prompted by \u0027an incident a few days before in which she says that Mr Harris when offered a bacon bap, had replied \u0027No, I want you\u0027 and lunged at her\u0027, the judge said.But after her making it clear that the physical touching must stop, she said Mr Harris became \u0027sulky\u0027 and \u0027intimidatory\u0027 before further incidents ensued.She said another meeting between the pair nearly a year later ended with Mr Harris cuddling Ms Shotton and saying: \u0027Can I squeeze your bum, no, squeeze your t*t, no, can I Harvey Weinstein your ar*e?\u0027.         Disgraced movie mogul Weinstein faces decades of accusations of rape and sexual misconduct Disgraced movie mogul Weinstein faces accusations of rape and sexual misconduct from actresses dating back decades.Ms Shotton later wrote a letter to him regarding that meeting, reading: \u0027At the end of the meeting, you approached me and asked for a hug as you have done in previous meetings...I felt I had no choice.\u0027You then made lewd comments to me and said \u0027can I Harvey Weinstein your ass?\u0027\u0027I left the two-hour meeting once again feeling violated.\u0027She then lodged a grievance at work against her boss, but it was rejected.After being accused of gross misconduct, Ms Shotton resigned in April 2018.She went on to tell the tribunal that she had been sexually harassed and then constructively dismissed.Judge Matthews in his ruling said: \u0027Our findings are that from the beginning of Ms Shotton\u0027s employment up to and including 10 January 2018, Mr Harris engaged in a continuous course of conduct of a sexual nature towards Ms Shotton.\u0027Prior to the 18 November 2016 meeting, we find that Ms Shotton at the very least displayed some ambivalence about whether the conduct was wanted or not.\u0027We think...Ms Shotton flirted with Mr Harris and probably put up with his conduct of a sexual nature as a convenient means of securing her job and influence.\u0027As time went on in this period, Ms Shotton changed her mind and started to protest.\u0027         Mr Harris, pictured had received a \u0027clear warning off\u0027 from Ms Shoton which he ignored, the judge said. None of his colleagues pictured are connected with the current caseThere had been a \u0027clear warning off\u0027 at the meeting in 18 November 2016, said the judge, adding: \u0027Thereafter, we have no doubt that the conduct was unwanted.\u0027The evidence is that Mr Harris was sexually infatuated with Ms Shotton and the purpose of his unwanted sexual conduct was sexual gratification,\u0027 the judge said, concluding that she was sexually harassed after 18 November 2016.The judge also found Ms Shotton was a direct victim of sex discrimination and had been \u0027unfairly constructively and wrongfully dismissed\u0027.\u0027The meeting on 18 November 2016 saw Ms Shotton drawing a clear line,\u0027 he said.\u0027From then on, Ms Shotton did not want any physical contact with Mr Harris. She wanted to be left alone in that respect and allowed to get on with her job.\u0027Had that happened, all may have been well.\u0027What happened however, as the facts demonstrate, is that Mr Harris could not overcome his infatuation with Ms Shotton, could not change his behaviours in any significant way and, as Ms Shotton feared, took his frustrations out on Ms Shotton in the workplace.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Pair accessed mortuary CCTV footage footballer Salas post mortem","story":"Share this article Charges allege he \u0027operated the closed circuit television equipment at the Bournemouth Mortuary and thereby caused the post-mortem of Emiliano Sala to be replayed by using the play-back facility\u0027.He is alleged to have done so on February 9 at 9.40pm and 11.23pm, on February 10 at 2.32am and 6.58am, and on February 11 at 1.26am and 9.35pm.Bray, of Corsham, is charged with three counts of causing a computer to perform a function to secure \u0027unauthorised access\u0027 to a program or data, contrary to the Computer Misuse Act 1990.          Bray and Ashford leave Swindon Magistrates\u0027 Court following the hearing this morning          A tribute left at Cardiff City Stadium for the footballer on February 8 following his deathCharges allege she \u0027operated the closed circuit television equipment at the Bournemouth Mortuary and thereby caused the post-mortem of Emiliano Sala to be recorded by using the live view camera facility\u0027 on February 7.She is charged with sending an \u0027offensiveindecentobscenemenacing message\u0027 of Sala taken from that examination the same day, contrary to the Communications Act 2003.Bray is accused of operating the CCTV equipment to cause the post-mortem examination to be replayed on February 8.It is alleged she perverted the course of public justice by instructing Ashford to \u0027delete your pics\u0027 on February 12 and deleted the post-mortem cameras at the Bournemouth Mortuary from the live feed camera facility the following day.She is alleged to have deleted the post-mortem image of Sala from her mobile phone on February 13, which \u0027had a tendency to pervert the course of public justice\u0027.

The V\u0026ampA boasts a Sackler centre for arts education and a £2m courtyard named after the family.“We take all of these ethical issues incredibly seriously,” said Hunt. “It goes to our audit committee, we discuss it in detail.”In March, the family announced it would stop donating to cultural institutions amid a string of rejections including from New York’s Met museum and the Tate Group.However, Dame Theresa Sackler, the widow of the former Purdue co-owner Mortimer Sackler, still sits on the V\u0026ampA’s board of trustees.When questioned about the appropriateness of her status, Hunt insisted Sackler was fit to be a trustee and emphasised that the family dispute many of the lawsuits brought against them.“Theresa brings a lot to the conversation in terms of her background as a primary school teacher and her focus on education,” he said.In March Theresa Sackler announced that the Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation were suspending all new charitable giving in the UK, saying that there was a danger of being a “distraction” for the bodies they support.In a statement on behalf of the Sackler Trust trustees she said: “I am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.”On Tuesday Hunt said he respected the family’s decision not to donate funds in the future. “We’re proud to have been supported by the Sacklers,” he added.Purdue is facing lawsuits from nearly every US state over the role of OxyContin in the deadly opioid crisis.In 2007, the company was fined for marketing OxyContin “with intent to defraud or mislead” regulators.Drug overdoses kill more than 72,000 people in the US each year. About 49,000 deaths are caused by opioids, including heroin and prescription painkillers such as fentanyl.In recent months, the US photographer Nan Goldin has been on the frontline of protests to campaign against links between art institutions and the Sacklers. Goldin became addicted to OxyContin after being prescribed it for tendinitis in 2014.Hunt, 45, became the museum’s director in 2017 after formally resigning as an MP. He presented history documentaries for the BBC before beginning his political career.Purdue Pharma denies any wrongdoing, as do the Sackler family members named in recent cases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/731db6625ebb857c82e43041ad93163e718dea86/0_111_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af2e7f9cd8b09986be29d724ff3793d9","title":"game of thrones prequel no targaryens or lannisters but plenty of starks","story":"George RR Martin reveals new details of HBO’s forthcoming spin-off serial, which is set to star Naomi Watts and Miranda RichardsonGeorge RR Martin has let slip a few details about the forthcoming Game of Thrones prequel, revealing that while there may be fewer dragons in the HBO television show, there will be direwolves, mammoths and White Walkers.The serial, which is currently being filmed in Northern Ireland, takes places thousands of years before the events in Game of Thrones and “chronicles the world’s descent from the golden age of heroes into its darkest hour”, according to HBO. Naomi Watts is lined up to star as “a charismatic socialite hiding a dark secret”, with Miranda Richardson also part of the cast. Jane Goldman and Martin himself are the show’s creators, with Goldman the showrunner.Martin said last year that the series would show Westeros as a very different place, with no King’s Landing, no Iron Throne and no Targaryens. “Valyria has hardly begun to rise yet with its dragons and the great empire that it built,” he told Entertainment Weekly.The show will, however, predate the Lannisters, with another family living in the home they occupy in Game of Thrones. “The Lannisters aren’t there yet, but Casterly Rock is certainly there it’s like the Rock of Gibraltar,” he said. “It’s actually occupied by the Casterlys — whom it’s still named after in the time of Game of Thrones.”The novelist also revealed that the Westeros of 5,000 years ago would be split into 100 different fiefdoms. “We talk about the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros there were Seven Kingdoms at the time of Aegon’s Conquest,” he said. “But if you go back further, then there are nine kingdoms, and 12 kingdoms, and eventually you get back to where there are 100 kingdoms – petty kingdoms – and that’s the era we’re talking about here.”Martin is currently writing The Winds of Winter, the long-awaited sixth novel in his series A Song of Ice and Fire. In May, he promised he would have finished writing it by summer 2020, when he travels to New Zealand for a science fiction convention. “If I don’t have The Winds of Winter in hand when I arrive in New Zealand for Worldcon, you have here my formal written permission to imprison me in a small cabin on White Island, overlooking that lake of sulphuric acid, until I’m done. Just so long as the acrid fumes do not screw up my old DOS word processor, I’ll be fine,” he wrote on his website.Episode 1: WinterfellEpisode 2: A Knight of the Seven KingdomsEpisode 3: The Long NightEpisode 4: The Last of the StarksEpisode 5: The BellsEpisode 6: The Iron ThroneEpisode 1: DragonstoneEpisode 2: StormbornEpisode 3: The Queen\u0027s JusticeEpisode 4: The Spoils of WarEpisode 5: EastwatchEpisode 6: Beyond The WallEpisode 7: The Dragon and the WolfEpisode 1: The Red WomanEpisode 2: HomeEpisode 3: OathbreakerEpisode 4: Book of the StrangerEpisode 5: The DoorEpisode 6: Blood of my BloodEpisode 7: The Broken ManEpisode 8: No OneEpisode 9: Battle of the BastardsEpisode 10: The Winds of WinterEpisode 1: The Wars to ComeEpisode 2: The House of Black and WhiteEpisode 3: High SparrowEpisode 4: Sons of the HarpyEpisode 5: Kill the BoyEpisode 6: Unbowed, Unbent, UnbrokenEpisode 7: The GiftEpisode 8: HardhomeEpisode 9: The Dance of DragonsEpisode 10: Mother\u0027s MercyEpisode 1: Two SwordsEpisode 2: The Lion and the RoseEpisode 3: Breaker of ChainsEpisode 4: OathkeeperEpisode 5: First of His NameEpisode 6: The Laws of Gods and MenEpisode 7: MockingbirdEpisode 8: The Mountain and the ViperEpisode 9: The Watchers on the WallEpisode 10: The ChildrenEpisode 1: Valar DohaerisEpisode 2: Dark Wings, Dark WordsEpisode 3: Walk of PunishmentEpisode 4: And Now His Watch Is EndedEpisode 5: Kissed by FireEpisode 6: The ClimbEpisode 7: The Bear and the Maiden FairEpisode 8: Second SonsEpisode 9: The Rains of CastamereEpisode 10: MhysaEpisode 1: The North RemembersEpisode 2: The Night LandsEpisode 3: What Is Dead May Never DieEpisode 4: Garden of BonesEpisode 5: The Ghost of HarrenhalEpisode 6: The Old Gods and the NewEpisode 7: A Man Without HonourEpisode 8: The Prince of WinterfellEpisode 9: BlackwaterEpisode 10: Valar MorghulisEpisode 1: Winter is ComingEpisode 2: The KingsroadEpisode 3: Lord SnowEpisode 4: Cripples, Bastards, and Broken ThingsEpisode 5: The Wolf and the LionEpisode 6: A Golden CrownEpisode 7: You Win or You DieEpisode 8: The Pointy EndEpisode 9: BaelorEpisode 10: Fire and Blood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3890b87b78a030694fef1f261a2300465a7c0ba2/154_138_3319_1991/master/3319.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eb4904761ad849a44ed471d782738fa","title":"airbus on course to overtake boeing as biggest planemaker","story":"European firm has edge after US rival reports slump in deliveries after two fatal crashesAirbus is on track to overtake Boeing as the world’s biggest planemaker as the US company reported a slump in deliveries of new commercial jet airliner deliveries after two fatal crashes involving the 737 Max.Boeing, which has led its European rival since 2012, is struggling after safety regulators worldwide grounded its best-selling 737 Max following the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people.The first Boeing 737 Max begins commercial operations with Malindo Air.

The Indonesian transport safety agency did not pinpoint a definitive cause of the accident, but said Lion Air kept putting the plane back into service despite repeatedly failing to fix a problem with the airspeed indicator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFlight ET302 crashes approximately six minutes after taking off from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people onboard. The captain had reported difficulties, and flight radar data shows the aircraft was climbing erratically with an unstable vertical airspeed.The EU, Canada and the US all ground the Boeing 737 Max. Boeing itself issues a statement saying it “continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max”, but that “out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public” it is recommending the grounding of the entire global fleet of 371 aircraft.The interim report into the Ethiopian Airlines crash finds that the pilots correctly followed Boeing’s emergency instructions, but were still unable to stop the plane’s nose repeatedly pointing down. The jet hit an airspeed of 500 knots (575mph), well above its operational limits, before cockpit data recordings stopped.Airlines extend their ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.United Airlines becomes the latest carrier to extend its ban on using the Boeing 737 Max after the US aviation regulator said it had identified a new potential risk with the plane.Before the crash, Boeing was delivering planes at a rate of 50 a month in the first quarter. Output has since slumped to only 30 a month in the second quarter. Boeing halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since it was grounded in mid-March.There are more than 150 undelivered Max planes parked at sites around the US as well as 380 owned by airlines that remain grounded. June was the third month running that Boeing booked no new orders of its Max aircraft. Air regulators are not expected to clear the model to fly again before the end of September as the company continues to work on fixing the aircraft’s flight-control systems.Airbus has been ramping up the pressure on Boeing by pushing its best-selling A320neo, a direct rival to the Max, and publicly announcing an increase in production.This week Boeing lost a provisional deal for 50 737 Max planes from flyadeal, the budget arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines, which instead ordered the Airbus rival. The deal, with a value of more than $5.5bn (£4.4bn), is one of the first direct signs that the Max crashes have resulted in business shifting to Boeing’s rival.However, last month at the Paris air show Boeing was given a shot in the arm when International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, signed a “letter of intent” to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded. The IAG order is yet to be officially booked by Boeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01a093afafc836abee08080715ed8b8114e8251f/28_227_3043_1826/master/3043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718548fe87f5382ec46ea0cd91d29339","title":"heineken pub and bar business investigated by pca over beer tie","story":"Regulator to see whether Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars puts unfair terms on market rent only tenanciesHeineken’s pubs and bars business is to be investigated over whether it imposes unfair terms on publicans who try to cut the “beer tie”, a centuries-old arrangement under which they buy beer from the owner of their premises.The pubs code adjudicator, the regulator that has been criticised for being supine in the face of deep-pocketed pub companies, said it had launched its first ever investigation, examining the behaviour of Heineken-owned Star Pubs \u0026amp Bars since July 2016.The PCA will look at whether Star, which has 2,700 pubs, has tried to impose unfair terms when tenants seek a “market rent only” option, an arrangement designed to allow tenants to sever the beer tie but which critics say is ineffective and often has strings attached.Pub landlords who rent their premises from Star will be asked whether the company tried to force them to stock only Heineken keg beer, or an unreasonable volume of the Dutch beer company’s brands, or other drinks in which it has a financial interest.They will also be asked whether Heineken tried to influence the retail price of its brands as part of an MRO agreement.Fiona Dickie, the deputy pubs code adjudicator, said: “It is important that Star tenants and other interested parties provide us with information to support this investigation. Their information will help us to determine whether the pubs code has been broken and, if so, what further action should be taken.”The investigation covers the period since the introduction in 2016 of the pubs code, which regulates companies with more than 500 establishments, including Admiral Taverns, Ei Group (formerly Enterprise Inns), Greene King, Marston’s and Punch Taverns.The code is meant to ensure “fair and lawful dealing” by major pub companies and that landlords are not worse off than they would be if they were free of the beer tie.The MRO section of the code is intended to provide a system under which landlords can escape the tie by negotiating a new agreement with their pub company, with the PCA overseeing an arbitration process.Publicans have frequently criticised the MRO option for being ineffective and the PCA for not doing enough to uphold its integrity.Any landlords who submit evidence have until 5 August and will not be identified in the final report.A Star spokesperson said: “The legislation is clear that as a brewer we have the right to ensure that the pubs we own sell our beer and cider. This reflects the significant ongoing investment we make and the jobs we support in our UK breweries, cideries and supply chain.“While the principle of the brewers stocking requirement is clear, this part of the new legislation is complex and not clearly defined in the pubs code. We therefore hope that this investigation will provide the certainty and clarity that we have sought repeatedly over the past three years. We will of course cooperate fully with the PCA whilst robustly defending our position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74cf6f6801993b0c3a4795a8d1aa396fa5097211/276_0_1725_1035/master/1725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4237e24b754a81470c0cd0e9e3a7f9ad","title":"qantas to inspect six a380s after cracks found on early models wings","story":"Airline’s head of engineering says inspections already completed on two aircraft generated ‘no concerns’The wings of six Qantas A380s will be inspected after small cracks were found on some early models of the superjumbo jets.Airbus has detected small cracks on the outer rear wings of early A380s, with 25 aircraft affected globally.Qantas’s head of engineering, Chris Snook, said inspections for the six Qantas jets are being done “well in advance” of the required timeframes, with two inspections already completed.“We have completed inspections on two aircraft and there were no concerns with the structural integrity of the wing,” Snook said on Wednesday.Airbus said the safety of the aircraft was not affected and the repairs must be carried out within 15 years of the initial wing box assembly.“We have identified the issue and designed an inspection and repair scheme,” an Airbus spokesperson said.The European Aviation Safety Agency said the cracks, if not detected and corrected, could reduce the structural integrity of the wing.The other airlines requiring A380 inspections include Emirates, Singapore Airlines, Air France and Lufthansa.Emirates, the world’s largest A380 operator, has started checks on nine of its superjumbos and “so far, there has been nothing untoward in the findings”, a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f723ce2d6232577e6b789c0aa743dd3ef2c3290c/0_0_2400_1439/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fc2010fc3b011b2c9197a855951507","title":"time for a new poor law elizabethan ideas win economics prize","story":"Family take share of £100,000 award with study of UK’s golden eras of growth including pioneering welfare systemBritain could look back more than 400 years to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I for inspiration on how to reboot the economy and tackle inequality, according to a joint winner of one of the most valuable prizes in economics.Simon Szreter, a professor of history and public policy at Cambridge University, his wife, Hilary Cooper, an economics consultant, and their son Ben Szreter, the chief executive of a community-based charity in Cambridge, were collectively one of two winners of the inaugural IPPR economics prize, worth a total of £100,000.Their entry focused on previous golden eras in UK economic growth that could help revitalise modern Britain.The Elizabethan poor law of 1601 forced the creation of one of the world’s first universal welfare systems and spurred one of the strongest periods of economic growth in UK history.It forced every parish in England to create a fund to support orphans, widows, elderly, disabled, ill and unemployed people, using progressive tax levies that meant the rich contributed most.The Szreter family argued that an economy thrived most when citizens were supported by a strong social security system.The IPPR prize ranks as the third most valuable in economics, behind the 9m Swedish krona (£760,000) Nobel award and the £250,000 Wolfson prize, which was launched in 2011 by the Tory peer and Next chief executive, Simon Wolfson.The other winner was a group of seven workers all aged 27 and under at London Economics, a consultancy, who proposed to devolve greater power to the regions of Britain, including moving 15,000 civil service jobs outside of the capital.The IPPR received more than 200 entries, which were judged by a panel including John Mills, the founder of JML, who was a funder of the award."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f37c9decfa353f69dbc8bfb25f7e08159c4521ab/156_0_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88d4cba6d33f2cfe3410a37a315e575c","title":"do you live in a city planned from scratch share your experiences","story":"New cities are being built around the world at an unprecedented pace.

Their boom shows no sign of stoppingby Rachel Keeton and Michelle ProvoostThis pattern of human occupation had characterised the country for thousands of years, but in the 1970s, as ever more precious green land was eaten up by urban growth, an idea that had been taking shape in the national consciousness for decades was finally put into policy. Egypt would “conquer the desert” and redistribute its burgeoning population across the white sands of the Sahara – an Egyptian version of the 19th-century US “manifest destiny” to move west, no matter how punishing the consequences.With Cairo bursting at the seams, plans were drawn up for satellite cities to take the strain. After many failed attempts 10th of Ramadan – a blue-collar industrial city – was the first experimental new city to take shape in the 1970s. Later new cities such as Sheikh Zayed City turned away from these working-class roots to become gated communities for the privileged – high income cities in a low-income country.For four decades the new cities programme has remained the only vehicle for Egypt’s urban development. Today there are 22 built or part-built Egyptian new cities – and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) has plans for 19 more. Around 7 million people now call these new cities home. It is arguably the most ambitious new cities programme the world has ever seen – a dream of bustling cities in an almost lunar desert landscape that outstrips the visions of even China and India.Named for the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war, the establishment of 10th of Ramadan to the north-east of Cairo was a populist move by an increasingly unpopular President Sadat, who sold it as a grand solution to tackle rampant unemployment, poverty and inflation with 100,000 jobs and half a million homes.Driving there from Cairo today, the cosmopolitan density of downtown soon gives way to miles of mid-rise concrete and brick apartment buildings that look solid, but are notorious for collapsing. Blink and you miss the line where lush date palms and cotton plants become desert sand. An hour after leaving Cairo, you enter 10th of Ramadan.Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping. New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.\u0026nbspThis week  Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.\u0026nbsp We look at Hong Kong’s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt’s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Although the masterplan – drawn up by Egyptian and Swedish engineering firms, and inspired by the modernist principles of Constantinos Doxiadis and the French villes nouvelles – depicts the city as a diamond in the desert, in reality the unfinished city appears to fade out from south to north. It is as though the desert were winning this 40-year struggle.But things here change fast. Every year the half-built new city is filled with more sand-coloured apartment blocks and villas. Huge open spaces, currently home to wandering packs of dogs, are flagged for future development. According to NUCA, 650,000 residents live here. The target is 2.1 million by 2023.Industries – plastics, paper, medical supplies and garment factories – are concentrated in a 10-mile strip along the southeastern edge of the diamond. Egyptian factory owners flocked here in the late 1970s when the government offered attractive incentives and many remain family-owned and operated. Some workers live in employer-provided houses and shared flats, or in dormitories within the factories themselves – but most low-level industrial employees are brought in daily by private buses from surrounding villages.It’s not a beautiful place. Housing is unapologetically bare, apart from the graffiti that covers many ground floor facades. Most public squares and playgrounds are dusty brown.From an ecological standpoint desert cities have obvious challenges, and 10th of Ramadan is no exception. A railway (promised for 40 years) is under construction but at the moment the city is accessible only by car, private minibus or public bus. Notorious traffic jams clog the highway to Cairo. Meanwhile, an aquifer gives 10th of Ramadan independence from the Nile, but makes the city vulnerable to pollution. A 2012 study detected chemical inorganic, biological, organic and bacteriological pollutants in all 31 groundwater samples tested.Still, the joy of public life is evident. Schoolchildren wander the streets and squares, stopping for a soda or kushari, a local street food. Women move in small groups, running errands collectively or gathering children from school. Residents know what cosmopolitan Cairenes think of 10th of Ramadan: that it is a blue-collar city without culture or finesse. But they tell you how much they appreciate the open space, the organisation, the quiet.In the 1970s and 1980s, men came for jobs and brought their families. Life in a city built from scratch can be alienating and lonely. As one first-generation garage owner put it: “The first few years here were the hardest thing I’ve ever done. No friends, no big family, nobody to rely on but ourselves.” But today – even though it remains a struggle to attract new residents – there are second and third generations living here. Even though downtown Cairo is only an hour away, for the residents of 10th of Ramadan the capital may as well be on the other side of the Sahara. In this much, at least, the experimental new city was a success.While 10th of Ramadan and Egypt’s other first generation new cities were industrial at heart, a restructuring from the World Bank and IMF in the 1990s brought a radical shift in policy.Under president Hosni Mubarak, NUCA began selling huge tracts of land to private developers at below market value.The second generation of new cities – exemplified by the gated communities of Sheikh Zayed City – became enclaves for wealthy Cairenes eager to escape the chaos of the capital.Although Sheikh Zayed City - 25 miles to the west of Cairo and named for the emir of Abu Dhabi who helped fund it in 1994 – was originally planned as a mixed-income city, it quickly transformed as NUCA discovered the profit-making potential of land sales to developers. Sheikh Zayed City became one of the first new cities to be filled with gated compounds, popular with the wealthy seeking security, status and privilege.The result is ision. Residents of gated compounds enjoy access to internal shops and clinics, as well as upscale shopping malls accessible only by car. Low income residents rely on limited public transport options to reach cheaper options in nearby satellite cities or in downtown Cairo. “Our demands are quite normal,” said one public housing resident at a recent protest. “Most of us are waiting for services such as shops, pharmacies and schools.”Arriving from Cairo, the first impression of Sheikh Zayed is one of absence: no urban cacophony, no pedestrians. No one walks here – distances are far and walking would imply that one cannot afford a car. The differences between public and private space are striking. Driving around, the city feels most like a collection of inaccessible islands of gated compounds and luxury plazas rather than a coherent whole. Gated compounds present only a glimpse of greenery over the top of high-security fences, and armed guards at the entrances of shopping plazas turn away groups of street children, allowing access only to those who look like they belong in these semi-private spaces. Signs for international franchises such as Starbucks, Baskin-Robbins and Costa Coffee speak to world-class aspirations. Public housing areas, in contrast, exude an atmosphere of general neglect and roadsides are strewn with garbage.The majority of housing in Sheikh Zayed is too expensive for most Egyptians, and like 10th of Ramadan, it has struggled to attract new people. Its current population of 330,000 inhabitants is just under half its target.The problem is exacerbated by private developers who build upmarket properties despite the lack of demand, and many villas lie derelict or unfinished. Layers of graffiti and live-in security guards suggest some have remained uninhabited for years.Speak to many of those who do live here, though, especially those who can afford to live in gated compounds, and many contrast the place positively with Cairo. Cairo is “dirty, overcrowded, unsafe, polluted,” they say Sheikh Zayed is “clean, quiet, well-organised and safe”.One businesswoman in her mid-30s praised Sheikh Zayed City’s “decent malls” and “good supermarkets”. “You feel free,” she added. “There’s no smell. Cairo smells like pigs.” A marketing manager welcomed the lack of “shabby people”. Many were content with the lack of public transport, believing a metro connection to Cairo would attract “the wrong kind” of new resident.These cities are far from full, but the new cities building boom shows no sign of stopping. What motivates Egypt to build more and more cities in the sand when there is such little public demand?According to economist and urban planner David Sims the whole programme may be too big to fail. There are “too many cheerleaders for desert development, too many interests intertwined in this development, and too many client groups to satisfy”. The programme also gives the government something to splash across state media, claiming it has done its job by building new homes, and supplies luxury housing so Egypt’s upper classes can escape from downtown.Last year the government announced an additional 20 new cities to house 30 million residents and be spread throughout Egypt. Among them is a new administrative capital, Wedian City, for 15 million people, to be built to the east of Cairo.It is unclear whether this current generation of new cities will learn from the experiences of four decades of new cities construction, or continue the extreme levels of spatial segregation of Sheikh Zayed City.What is certain, though, is that existing cities are being neglected. As Egypt continues to construct cities from scratch in the sand the aged urban areas of downtown Cairo and Alexandria have no large-scale renovation or upgrading plans. Egypt’s old cities are crumbling to dust.This article is an edited extract from To Build a City in Africa: a History and a Manual by Rachel Keeton and Michelle Provoost, published by NAI010 and the International New Town Institute (INTI)Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ffb40685f712e183a4b6169950b657f77450cd5/0_64_2491_1494/master/2491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adc2c84f782697ec0dfd7330d687a045","title":"itennis players grunters everywhere archaeologists office workers","story":"From archaeologists to office workers, people feel the need to accompany hard work with a grunt. But why do they do it?When the umpire at Wimbledon calls out “quiet, please”, a religious hush falls over the court. The only things that break the silence are the gentle pop of a bouncing tennis ball, the faint murmur of the crowd, and the passionate grunting of the players.Grunting is a strange quirk of professional tennis, but it’s also quite common among the rest of us. Visit your local gym and you will find people groaning during their workout. Many have shared an office with a person who groans as they hammer away at their keyboard. One friend complained about how her husband would grunt as he struggled with boxes she would lift in silence. Perhaps the strangest story I heard was about archaeologists who would habitually grunt in the midst of over-enthusiastic soil clearing.Why is it that archaeologists, office workers and tennis players seem so keen on grunting their way through their working day? If you ask a grunter, they will probably tell you that their vocal outbursts are an inevitable byproductof their physical and mental efforts. Other grunters may say that crying out while they work helps them to achieve their best. But is grunting really a natural response to hard work or a motivational technique? Or are grunters trying to make others think they are working harder than they really are?Grunting is fairly new to the world of tennis. For many decades, players were expected to play the game in practised silence. Making too much noise was considered unseemly. That all changed in the 1970s when Jimmy Connors, the father of the tennis grunt, dominated the game. During the 1980s and 1990s, grunting spread among professional tennis players. Tabloid newspapers began to routinely measure the decibels of tennis grunters. Grunting also became increasingly controversial. In 2009, Martina Navratilova said that “grunting has reached an unacceptable level. It is cheating, pure and simple. It is time for something to be done.”While grunting has enemies, it also has champions. One coach, Nick Bollettieri, worked with some of the loudest players in the game such as Monica Seles, Maria Sharapova and Michelle Larcher de Brito. Bollettieri’s eponymous tennis academy recommends grunting as a “psychological and physiological release of tension”, and a way of “synchronising breathing precisely with hitting ball” to “increase focus, intensity and force production”.A more recent study found players used grunts to make predictions about how fast the ball came back at them. If they heard a particularly intense grunt, they assumed the ball was coming back at them quickly. This meant carefully placed grunts could be used by a skilled player to manipulate how quickly their opponent thought the ball was travelling.All this research might lead you to think that grunters are strategic geniuses. Sadly, grunting is not always a sign of success. A study from a few years ago found that as a player begins to lose a game, their grunts take on a high pitch. The lesson here seems to be that grunting can improve performance, trick your opponent, but also be a sign that you’re losing the game.Studying grunters on the court can help us to understand the grunters in our gyms, our offices and our homes. Grunting can drive people on. A bit of guttural effort might just help to squeeze out a little extra as someone lifts a barbell, finishes a boring spreadsheet or folds a load of washing.But beware, grunting can be used to deceive. By making lots of noise, a grunter may be trying to communicate with you how hard they are trying. Sometimes these cries of effort can fool us into thinking that the grunter is giving it their all when in fact they are taking it easy. And remember, there is always a slightly tragic side to grunting if they take a higher pitch: it’s a sign they are failing. When your colleague is slowly defeated by the IT system, the high-pitched grunts that come from their desk are a sign of impending doom.So, next time you hear someone grunting away, remember what you are hearing could be sincere effort, an attempt to deceive or a cry for help. Sometimes, it is likely to be all three at once.• André Spicer is professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School at City, University of London."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7831ac79d126e480974dbea01d636c3c01d229c/0_362_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c2fa872ca27a8b09c665895e6d3f046","title":"question eu done european funding britain local area","story":"European funding has supported Britain for decades. Yet few people seem to know how much it has benefited their local areaThe Angel of the North has been widely embraced as a totem of the north-east since its 1998 installation, and having passed it so often, last month I finally carved out the time to see it up close. A small information board at the site, built on Gateshead’s Team colliery, which closed in 1974, features an explanation from the sculptor, Antony Gormley, that the angel honours the region’s heavy industrial past while aspiring towards a renewed economic future. A little detail is included about Gateshead council’s difficulties in raising the £800,000 needed for its monument to regeneration, and in the bottom lefthand corner of the board is a tiny blue and yellow symbol of one organisation that came up with the cash: the European Union.In June 2016, a majority of people in the north-east, including Gateshead, voted to leave the EU, against the advice of their local authorities, trade unions, business organisations, major political parties, universities and local employers such as the carmaking giant Nissan. All argued that the region’s progress towards economic renewal, which has made it a net exporter to the EU largely due to Nissan, would be severely disrupted by Brexit. But in a region that had suffered such prolonged industrial decay, the message simply didn’t cut through. There was and still is little clear appreciation of answers to the basic question: “What has the EU ever done for me?”One worker at the Nissan factory told me he voted leave because the north-east got “bugger all money” from the EU. This despite Nissan alone benefiting from huge European regional development fund (ERDF) grants and, in just the eight years before the referendum, £450m in loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB). It is difficult to believe that the referendum would have swung the same way had more prominence been given over the decades to the EU’s concrete contribution, particularly to rebuilding efforts in regions suffering economic decline.The Newcastle Chronicle did run an article in June 2016 detailing the EU’s funding of regeneration landmarks, including the Sage music venue and Baltic art gallery on the Gateshead side of the Tyne, and the Millennium Bridge over to the Newcastle side. Economic development projects qualified for millions in European grants, including infrastructure works on the Tyne’s north bank, and the old Swan Hunter shipyard’s transformation into a centre for developing offshore energy, subsea and marine industries.The Liverpool Echo did the same exercise, listing 17 transformative developments, including of formerly derelict land around Lime Street station, major improvements to Liverpool John Lennon airport, and the arena and convention centre on the waterfront. Merseyside qualified for £1.6bn “Objective One” EU funding between 1994 and 2013 to try to haul it out of decline.But those were isolated local newspaper efforts amid years of misinformation and a void of basic information. That Boris Johnson and his Vote Leave campaign got away with quoting an imaginary £350m weekly contribution to the EU without acknowledging the £5.6bn rebate or the annual £4bn invested back into the UK illustrated the general lack of knowledge about the basics of membership. The European funding system has always been valued by regional leaders because it is objective, and based on the actual regeneration need. More money per head is available for “less developed” regions, as Merseyside was.Currently almost the whole of Wales and Cornwall qualifies, while large parts of the north-east, north-west, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Yorkshire and Humberside are classed as “transition” regions for investment. EU “structural funding” – from the ERDF and European Social Fund – was worth approximately £10bn to the UK between 2007 and 2013, and approximately £11bn is allocated from 2014 to 2020, with a further £25bn available for rural development and agriculture.It is true of course that the UK – along with France, Germany and six other wealthier EU countries – is a net contributor to the EU, according to the long-agreed aim of raising living standards across the continent to help build peace, stability and a more prosperous single market that benefits all countries.And even while the UK turns its back on the EU it still – if you can find the corner of its website – hails the “achievements” of ERDF funding, saying that from 2007 to 2013 “billions of pounds were invested into local projects”, creating 131,375 jobs. It even publishes a little booklet, Supporting Local Growth, citing many successful investments across the country.This government’s idea for replacing that whole investment structure has struggled to clear the sketch-on-napkin stage under Theresa May, and barely been mentioned in Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt’s unedifying Tory leadership campaigns. A consultation on the “shared prosperity fund” promised to be completed by the end of 2018 never began, and the fund remains imaginary.Even now, before it really is too late, the benefits to Britain of being in the EU need to be explained positively and clearly, not pushed to the fringes of understanding, like the tiny symbol beneath the Angel of the North."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a8680fdd0c59bd58711d531c0b5540c7eb85ba/0_96_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23672d733e0cfc3597687578214a61d1","title":"westminster uk recession looms","story":"Politicians and pundits may be distracted, but economists are already talking about another financial crisisGod bless Britain’s political class, for in their capacity for happy self-absorption they are as reliably easy to please as a puppy. Just chuck them the right chew toy.Who won last night’s head-to-head, Boris or Jeremy? Gnaw gnaw. What is George Osborne playing at? Snuffle, snuffle. Doesn’t young Matt Hancock look tortured these days? Slobber, slobber. And so politicians and pundits paw away, the existential questions facing an entire country somehow never quite as rousing as the latest gossip from Versailles.Still, at some point this summer, a few yawningly prosaic points will intrude. Such as how our tousle-headed Nero hopes to govern with a working majority of just three MPs – and that’s counting on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who have proved to be the most unreliable partners since … well, Boris Johnson himself. How he plans to see off the vote of no confidence that Jeremy Corbyn is preparing to put down, and which may be backed by anywhere up to 30 Conservative backbenchers. How he will secure the passage of a Queen’s speech, given parliament has just sat for the longest session since the civil war because Theresa May couldn’t get one through.However commanding his lead among Tory activists, Johnson is about to form the most fragile government seen in Britain for almost 50 years. What’s more, he’ll do so burdened with one huge problem that not even May had to face: a recession.While at Westminster they dare not even whisper the word, City folk and economists are already discussing the prospect in tones of grim resignation. Speaking in Bournemouth last week, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned of a “sea change” in the world economy. The UK economy didn’t appear to be growing at all, he noted, “and is heavily reliant on … household spending”.The figures back him up. The most watched surveys of British businesses, released in the past few days, suggest the private sector is already shrinking. In the construction sector, which has just had its worst month since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, they now talk of “quicksand”. Manufacturing has been pole-axed, while out in the much larger service sector things look utterly moribund. Last week, it was briefly cheaper for the British government to borrow over five years than for two – the first time that has happened since just before the death in 2008 of Lehman Brothers. Even in a world turned upside-down by central banks pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets, that is usually taken as indicating that a sharp slowdown lies around the corner. This one will be nowhere near as disastrous as the crash of 2008-9 but it will underline how far the world remains lodged in the shadow of that crisis.The UK is suffering an intense version of an international problem. Around the world, central bankers from the eurozone to Australia can see a sharp slowdown on the horizon – and are warning they have little in the drawer to head it off. As for governments: in the US, Donald Trump spent most of his political capital on a tax cut for the rich in 2017, while any European government that defies the rule of austerity risks destruction, as Greece’s former prime minister Alexis Tsipras has learned over the past four years. Ten years ago, China helped save the world by launching a spending programme worth nearly $600bn – throwing up airports and high-speed rail lines within months. Beijing will not do the same this time around.In the UK, as I wrote here last week, Johnson is talking of a hard-right version of a Keynesian stimulus, with tax cuts for the rich and huge bungs for big corporates. That will steal Corbyn’s clothes as the anti-austerity party leader, but it will be of no help to the mum living off a fiver while waiting for her universal credit to come through, or to the teachers whipping up a food bank for their pupils. Not with Sajid Javid as potentially the first chancellor to profess both love of libertarian high priestess Ayn Rand and his total unwillingness even to break off a family holiday to save the steel industry.Put that picture together, and the outline of something truly frightening starts to emerge. A ruling party on its last legs in a political system sapped of nearly all legitimacy. A country that has spent most of the decade mired in the weakest recovery for 300 years – as Blanchflower describes it in his new book, Not Working: Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? – which is now giving way to recession. And a political class that still kids itself it can get a better Brexit deal out of the rest of the EU, or even that it will survive a crashing-out with only a few nicks and grazes.This might make good copy in Westminster, but the turbulence of either scenario will push businesses and families to the wall in the Midlands, Wales and the north. As Birmingham-based economist Paul Forrest points out, in the run-up to the last exit date Jaguar Land Rover announced the shutdown of four plants in Castle Bromwich, Halewood, Solihull and Wolverhampton for two weeks, to avoid “potential Brexit disruption”. Imagine what that employer of 43,000 staff might do this autumn. Then think of Nissan, Honda, Peugeot … and imagine how the speculators will pile on the pound, pushing it down to $1.10 and then below.“My background is in emerging markets,” says Forrest, “and the last time I saw this amount of pent-up chaos was when Russia devalued in 1998.” Should you need reminding, that crisis impoverished middle-class Russians and wiped out the Moscow ruling class.Throughout my adult life, Britain’s political system has got by on bluff and bluster. On ever-cheaper credit for the masses and dark money for the party funders. On half-understood technocratic management by unelected officials and masterful presentational skills by the politicians. On a housing market that just kept rising like an impossible soufflé and the pretence that the Adults Were In Charge. Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, David Cameron – all of them got by on versions of the same strategy. It was always a cheat, and perhaps the one good thing about the poisonous 2016 referendum was how it illustrated how many people had sussed they were being conned. And now, under Johnson, the entire bluffers’ system is on the verge of disintegrating, with no glimmer at all of what may replace it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59a06b0a196668fba1fd0b32b065f4583611c883/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb5f29fd82273c3ece072e08a1ba66c","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of summer","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘summer’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘summer’.Share your photos of what summer means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 10 July at 10am.

If that didn’t rule out a large enough section of society, married women were also barred from selection – on the grounds that it would not be appropriate for them to be away from home for a six-month tour.The youthful team – all were under 25 – set off for Australia with a squad of seven teachers or future teachers, two secretaries, an art student, a lawyer, a nurse, and three “ladies of leisure” – plus Myrtle Maclagan, who was employed by the army.Having agreed to not smoke, drink, gamble or find themselves “accompanied by a man”, England’s players were also far more prepared than their Australian counterparts, who only began searching for players 28 days before the first Test was due to begin.Unsurprisingly, England romped to victory. All-rounder Maclagan sent down a searing spell to earn figures of 7-10 and rattle out Australia for 47 in the first innings – picking up the first five-wicket haul in a women’s international in the process.Maclagan followed that up with another impressive milestone, hitting 72 of the visitors’ first-innings score of 154. Though the home side were more resilient with the bat at the second time of asking, England comfortably knocked off the required 32 runs to secure a nine-wicket win.The second Test at the historic Sydney Cricket Ground followed much the same pattern. Maclagan’s century in England’s first innings was the highlight of a match that saw the visitors requiring just 10 runs in the second innings.Although this eight-wicket victory sealed the series, there was no trophy for England captain Betty Archdale to raise in triumph – the WCA’s founding constitution, set out in 1930, proclaimed that “no member of any affiliated club shall take part in any cricket challenge cup or prize competition”.England retained the Ashes on home soil in 1937 after a drawn series and the second world war put paid to the scheduled 1939-40 Ashes it wasn’t until the winter of 1948-49 that England’s players set out for Australia once more. This time around, the hosts were much better prepared. The team were fitter and more skilful, and the crowd of 17,025 across three days in Adelaide – still the highest for a women’s Test in Australia – cheered on a comprehensive 186-run victory, which gave the Australians a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Australian all-rounder Betty Wilson – who turned down three marriage proposals during the  of her international career in order to continue playing cricket – was the undoubted star of the Test. Her brilliant knock of 111 – ended by run-out – was followed by a six-wicket haul, then 3-39 in the second innings.Although the following Tests were more competitive, two draws earned Australia’s women their maiden Ashes series victory. Scoring 268 runs and picking up an impressive 16 wickets across the three matches, Wilson stood head and shoulders above the rest of the players. But still no trophy.It took 34 more Tests and more than 64 years for England and Australia’s women to have something to fight over. In 1998, a miniature bat was burned in a wok in the Harris Garden at Lord’s on July 20, and the ashes were placed in a small wooden trophy.Also in the wok was a copy of the WCA constitution and rulebook – the WCA was finished, having voted to merge with the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board, and it seemed only right that its “no prize” rule go up in smoke.England were unable to break Australia’s dominance at that stage, however, and the Southern Stars retained the Ashes until 2005 (which some will remember as a good year for the men too).In 2013, the Ashes changed from being Test-only to consist of one Test, three one-day internationals and three T20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for a Test win, or two points for a draw, with two points awarded for a limited-over win and one for a draw.Although the Test match in 2013 was drawn, England triumphed in two ODIs and three T20s to win the home series 12-4 and reclaim the Ashes. A second – but closer – series win followed in Australia, less than six months later, before the format was tweaked in 2015 to reduce a Test win to four points Australia have won then retained the Ashes since.While so much of women’s sport struggles to emerge from the shadows of the men’s game, or strives to emulate it, the Women’s Ashes has always forged its own path, with four-day Tests – an option often discussed for the men’s game – and now an exciting multi-format competition that has opened up new audiences.But it would be nothing without the players, and these days those players come from all walks of life. Cricket Charity Chance to Shine has introduced 4 million state school children to the game since 2005, 2 million of whom are girls, and NatWest has partnered with the charity to ensure this important work continues.

Heading online, the ckbk digital library boasts precisely three results for spinach and ricotta cannelloni out of 75,000 on the site, leading me to suspect that, like balti, or General Tso’s chicken, it’s all but unknown in its apparent home country.My Rome correspondents Rachel Roddy and Kristina Gill, however, quickly disabuse me of that notion – indeed, Roddy tells me that at her local fresh pasta shop, cannelloni di ricotta e spinaci now sell better than the classic meat filling. Gill, however, after kindly trawling through “maybe 30 books” in her more extensive collection, confirms that there are surprisingly few published recipes for it, even though The Silver Spoon, often cited as the authority on Italian cuisine, describes spinach and ricotta as the traditional filling for cannelloni.Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that it’s also the classic choice for many other stuffed pastas, and even the crespelle (pancakes) often used instead of pasta in Abruzzo and Campania. The beauty of cannelloni, however, is that they’re incredible easy to make, and bake, hence their popularity on restaurant menus. But what’s the best way to go about it?Strangely enough, the dried tubes of cannelloni I remember from childhood seem to have disappeared from my local supermarket, though they are still available in larger stores. I do have a go with sheets of fresh egg lasagne, however, and can confirm that, if you’re short of time, these also work a treat.Spinach is the preferred choice, obviously – I’d advise searching out bunches of mature stuff, rather than tiny baby spinach leaves sold in supermarkets, which, in my experience, collapse to mush once wilted and baked. If you can’t find them (greengrocers, markets and farm shops are a good source), the next best thing, as Caldesi says, is to buy it frozen, but make sure you get the whole leaf stuff, not the strangely popular pucks of green puree, then defrost and squeeze well before use – any excess liquid will make your filling watery.Christopher Boswell writes in Pasta: Recipes from the Kitchen of the American Academy in Rome that in his kitchen they make these cannelloni with “any greens we have handy. Chard, nettles, turnip tops, cavolo nero and kale all work well.” I try one recipe with cavolo nero, and it proves very popular indeed, the stronger flavour is actually preferred by some of my testers. If you do use more robustly textured greens, cook them in salted water until tender, dunk in cold water, then drain very well before finely chopping.Others add garlic or other aromatics to “bump up the flavour”, as Caldesi puts it – she deploys “soft leaf herbs, such as basil, chives, parsley and oregano”. We all love her cannelloni, but they do taste more of herbs than spinach or ricotta, so if you’re keen for these rather shy and retiring ingredients to remain the stars of the show, I’d recommend sauteeing the spinach in butter with just a little crushed garlic, as the Silver Spoon suggests, to enhance, rather than obscure them.A good sprinkling of salt and a generous grating of nutmeg, which works so well with both ricotta and spinach, are completely non-negotiable.Ricotta is, of course, the order of the day I love it in all its forms, but with such a plain dish, it’s worth buying some really good fresh stuff for this. Many recipes add grated hard cheese to the filling, too – usually grated parmesan, or grana padano in Boswell’s recipe. Bear in mind that if you want to make this dish strictly vegetarian, you’ll need to source a vegetarian alternative they’re widely available these days.Some recipes, though not all, add eggs to the filling as well – or just yolks in the case of Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy’s The Geometry of Pasta – but I can’t see the point those without are just as good, and I think have a slightly softer, creamier texture.Because cannelloni are baked, they need a sauce, rather than just the drizzle of melted butter you can get away with in other filled pastas. Bechamel and tomato are the two most common choices, and both put in an appearance in Caldesi’s recipe. While in my opinion you can never have too much sauce, it cannot be denied that making two is double the work. What’s more, the overwhelming preference of testers, with the honourable exception of the dog, is for the tomato version, on the basis that “the milky bechamel is too similar to the ricotta”.You could just keep things very simple and, like Boswell, puree a tin of plum tomatoes, but we agree that the plainness of the filling demands a little more in the way of savoury oomph from the supporting sauce: Caldesi’s long-simmered tomato passata, flavoured with vegetables and herbs, is just perfect.We also like her commitment to crisp edges – surely the best bit of almost any gratin – and to this end would recommend not covering the pasta completely with passata. Unless you’re making this for a crowd, however, or have only a very small baking dish to hand, I wouldn’t bother with two layers of cannelloni – sheltered from direct heat, the base layer inevitably goes soggy.In fact, in pursuit of maximum crunch, finishing the dish under the grill, as the Silver Spoon and Pasta Sapori d’Italia suggest, is a very good idea indeed. Adding extra parmesan at this point is between you and your waistband.For the pasta (or use 250g fresh egg lasagne sheets)170g ‘00’ flour80g semolina flour1 big pinch salt2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolkFor the sauce1 tbsp olive oil1 onion, peeled and cut in half1 carrot, cut in half lengthways1 celery stick, cut in half 800g tinned plum tomatoes1 small bunch basilDash of balsamic vinegar, or ½ tsp sugar and a dash of wine vinegarFor the filling250g fresh mature spinach, or 140g defrosted leaf spinach1 tbsp butter1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed175g fresh ricotta30g Italian hard cheese, gratedNutmegStart with the pasta, if you’re making it yourself. Mix the flours and the salt, make a well in the middle, then pour in the whole eggs and egg yolk. Gradually mix in the flour until you have a dough you can bring together with your hands, adding a splash of water, if necessary.Knead for about 10 minutes, until it feels smooth and springs back when poked, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour.Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a wide pan over a medium heat, add the onion, carrot and celery, and fry for a couple of minutes, until starting to brown. Tip in the tomatoes, basil and vinegar (or vinegar and sugar), bring everything up to a simmer, then turn down the heat and cook for about half an hour, until thick. Remove and discard the vegetables and herbs, then whizz the sauce with a hand blender (or mash) until fairly smooth, and season to taste.While the sauce is cooking, trim and discard any tough stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves well. Put the still-wet spinach in a saucepan over a medium heat, cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until completely wilted, then run under cold water to prevent it cooking further. Once it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze until dry, then chop finely.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic, cook for a minute, then add the spinach. Saute to coat with the butter, then turn off and leave to cool.Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1cm thick and will go through the widest setting of your pasta machine comfortably. Put it through each setting but the very narrowest twice – the sheets don’t need to be paper-thin. Cut into pieces about 10cm long, blanch in boiling salted water for a minute, then drain on a clean tea towel.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Mix the spinach with the ricotta and most of the grated cheese, reserving a handful for the top, and season well with nutmeg and salt.Cover the bottom of a medium baking tin with a thick layer of tomato sauce, then put a sausage of filling on the short end of one of the pasta squares and roll up, cutting away any excess once you have a slight overlap. Put the filled tube seam side down in the baking dish, and repeat with the remaining pasta and filling you’ll probably be left with some excess pasta, which will keep in the fridge for several days, stored between greaseproof paper. Tip the remaining sauce on top, leaving a margin around the edge, then bake for 30 minutes.To finish, scatter over the remaining grated cheese, grill until bubbling, then serve.• Spinach and ricotta cannelloni: an understated classic or rightly overlooked by cookbooks?

Here are 18 quick and easy stunners, from Middle Eastern dips to Indian street snacksOver the past 50 years, the chef Alice Waters, owner and chief ideologue at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, has played a pivotal role in the popularisation of local, seasonal cooking. In her 2017 memoir, Coming to My Senses, Waters boiled her rationale down to its essence, almost literally. Her favourite recipe, she wrote, is: “Go cut some mint from the garden, boil water, pour it over the mint. Wait. And then drink.”Can exceptional flavours really be that simple? To find out, G2 asked a selection of top chefs for their favourite simple recipes, where a minimum of cooking transforms a few ingredients into a killer dish.“As a child, my biggest loves were strawberries and Slush Puppies. In summer, we’d go fruit-picking, gather a glut of juicy strawberries and Mum would blend them with sugar and ice to create the most amazing slushies. Being Asian, you’re introduced to chillies and heat early and mum would grind black pepper on top, which brings out the flavour in strawberries.”Joe Wright, chef and co-owner, Porta, Chester“Hot weather encourages simplicity good produce prepared with little faff. The Spanish excel at this. I often recreate a dish I was first served on the beach in Almería: roughly chopped tomatoes, good olive oil, fresh oregano with tinned ventresca tuna. No cooking whatsoever. The Spanish love good tinned seafood and ventresca is the prized tuna belly, line-caught, cooked in seawater, filleted and tinned by hand. It’s food of the gods.”Simon Hulstone, chef-owner, the Elephant, Torquay“I love to gently melt marshmallows in a bain marie to blood temperature, and mix through Rice Krispies. Set it in a tray, cut it into pieces, dip them in melted chocolate and people bloody love ’em. This is Michelin cooking: we only use a top-end Kellogg’s and proper Flumps.”“This is a street snack in India, but I love it as a simple summer salad, too. Chop a cucumber into cubes, sprinkle chaat masala, cumin powder and black salt over and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. On hot days, there’s no better way to cool down.”“In New York, I worked with an Israeli chef, Shlomo Kashy, who introduced me to labneh, basically a Middle Eastern yoghurt. You can find it in the UK now. He would spoon it into jars, top with good-quality olive oil and a warm za’atar spice mix of dried marjoram, sesame and sumac, and then dip warm bread into it. It was a revelation.”Mary-Ellen McTague, chef-owner, the Creameries, Manchester“The nutty, caramel flavour of burnt butter – beurre noisette in French – lifts everything. You put butter in a pan, apply heat till it turns a nice golden brown, take it off the heat, let it cool and strain it. It will keep for months in the fridge. It’s a brilliant dressing for fish, particularly meaty roast fish such as turbot, and it’s really nice on cabbage and celeriac. With four ingredients – grilled cabbage, burnt butter, salt and lemon juice – you can produce a pretty good lunch.”Elaine Mason, ‘chief soup-bunger’ and owner, Union of Genius soup bar, Edinburgh“It’s the simplest soup I do: five ingredients, 40 minutes and brilliant at any time. It’s savoury and warming in winter, nourishing and tangy in summer. Dice and fry an onion, two potatoes and four garlic cloves in olive oil, add a litre of ham stock and simmer for 30 minutes. Fry about 15cm of good cooking chorizo in a dry pan. Tip the chorizo and its oil into the stock, with a big handful of shredded kale and a teaspoon of paprika and smoked paprika. Give it 10 minutes to get itself together, grind black pepper over and enjoy.”Mayur Patel, head chef and co-owner, Bundobust, Leeds“Gujaratis love having a sweet dish alongside savoury ones, I guess to act as a counter to spicy heat. Ras (or aamras) is pureed mango with salt and cumin seeds – gently toasted in a dry pan to release their oils, then crushed in a pestle and mortar – stirred through, to taste. I normally eat it with aubergine and bean curry, but I’ve got many childhood memories of Mum making hot buttered rotis for me to dip in freshly pulped ras.”Stephen Harris, chef, the Sportsman, Whitstable“Simplicity is much easier in summer. I go into my polytunnel, pick a courgette, peel ribbons from it, drizzle them with good olive oil, lime, salt and a few herbs, leave it five minutes and it’s stunning. Supermarket courgettes don’t smell, but pick one in the garden and it smells, I think, of mint and truffles. There’s so much going on there.”“In summer, I get terrific tomatoes from a grower near Southport. I blanch, peel and chop them, dress them with olive oil, lemon zest, salt and pickled shallots and add St James ewe’s milk cheese. It’s a great family supper, especially with barbecued mackerel.”Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner, Trullo, London“Quality salted anchovies, salted butter and crunchy bread served in three piles on the table – assemble and eat. I came across this at London’s Terroir and thought it was French until I visited Rome, where it is everywhere. It always makes life happier.”“Partly due to having small children, I need to cook with as little prep as possible. I’m obsessed with things you can put on a tray, bung in the oven and produce a meal from. For this, you halve loads of cherry tomatoes (it’s a summer dish I wouldn’t risk out-of-season tomatoes), chuck them on a baking tray with tinned white beans, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper for 15 minutes at 180C160C fan350Fgas mark 4. Then season and place whole sardines – or fillets if you’re funny about bones – on top of the ingredients for another eight minutes. Remove from oven. Eat, from the pan if necessary.”Sharon Hearne-Smith, author of The No-Cook Cookbook“Crush the berries with a fork, stir in grated apple, honey and cinnamon to taste. Add chia seeds, which magically thicken it into a beautiful jam – one healthier than bought. I’m a mum to two small children and we love this jam with yoghurt and granola.”Isaac McHale, chef, the Clove Club, London“Take 10 ultra-thin slices of smoked pancetta and 10 vine-ripened cherry tomatoes. Wrap each tomato in slice of pancetta, like a belt. Skewer the tomatoes in sets of five – carefully put two skewers in each set, so you can turn them – and grill until they’re warm and bursting and the pancetta is melting. Eat slowly and smile.Sally Abé, head-chef, the Harwood Arms, London“You’re stirring a few ingredients together – two smoked mackerel fillets, a tablespoon of creme fraiche, lemon juice, salt and horseradish – to create a thing of beauty. Don’t overmix it, you want lovely pieces of fish in there, add the creme fraiche slowly to get the consistency right and it needs a good amount of lemon juice to cut the mackerel’s fattiness.”Sarit Packer, chef and co-owner, Honey \u0026amp Co, London“Pistachios and rose water give our marzipan a Middle Eastern twist. Mix ground pistachios, icing sugar, lemon juice, a little lemon zest, a drop of rose water and ground cardamom together until it is a smooth paste working by hand helps extract the oil from the nuts. Tear off bite-size pieces and roll them into balls. It’s a delicious sweet treat after dinner, served with strong coffee or fresh mint tea.”“Take a handsome pointed cabbage, shred it, massage it with coarse salt until it softens and starts weeping. Pack it into a jar submerged in its own juices. Let the cabbage hang out for a few weeks until it is transformed.”“This is similar to a kathi roll, a popular street food in Calcutta where I grew up. My boys love it. Season an egg with salt and pepper, add a cube of butter and fry the mixture like an omelette. Put a tortilla wrap on top (it will stick to the omelette), turn it over, add salad and a sauce and roll it into a wrap.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11cf67206c448a7acd1c73d11bddb5c7763dba31/815_107_4323_2594/master/4323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00186554188c274cef947b0ccc3ae8f1","title":"artist banners anfield liverpool fan kop art peter carney","story":"Peter Carney is an artist, banners are his means of expression and the Kop is his canvasBy MUNDIAL, part of the  Sport NetworkPeter Carney makes the banners on the Kop at Anfield. These aren’t a St George’s cross with a town’s name in the middle or a lewd message scrawled on a bedsheet. These are rippling oceans of red and white that are unveiled every fortnight and take in life, death, politics, protest, celebration and unity. Peter is not just some bloke who makes banners. He is an artist.The first thing you need to know about Peter is that he’s busy. He’s not leave me alone busy he’s just driving a minibus, conducting a sold-out matchday tour, caring for an autistic lad a few days a week, setting up before the match and making an intricate banner every fortnight busy. But somehow he can still fit you in. The second thing you need to know about Peter is that he always has an idea for a banner.“You know what? I don’t like to see them on the floor because I don’t like to look down at the names. People should look up at the names,” says Peter as we stand in the hall of a community centre in Walton with two banners spread out in front of us. He gestures to the one closest. “This banner I made the week after the Hillsborough disaster. I had the cloth in the house. It was window dressing material. I was working on designing a banner that celebrated Liverpool’s centenary in 1992. I’d only started on it, working out the scale and stuff and then the disaster happened.”On 15 April 1989, Liverpool went to Hillsborough for an FA Cup semi-final and 96 of their fans never came home. Peter survived the disaster, but the catastrophic scenes he witnessed had a lasting effect on him. He would become a crucial campaigner in the fight for justice and his original Hillsborough Memorial banner would act as a sign of respect and a symbol to unite around.“I went to the ground the following day. My mate Fred lived seven doors from the Shankly Gates. I went to his for a cup of tea and I said: ‘Fred, we’ve got to make a banner.’ So, between Tuesday and Thursday we made the banner and on Friday we displayed it as part of a tribute at the ground. I think it’s the only tribute that was taken to the ground with the intention of bringing it back. Everything else was left, but I never left mine. I’ve lived, so the banner lives. It was my tribute to these people and the purpose is to keep alive the names and memories of those who were killed.”The banner itself is a relic. Faded but instantly recognisable, small trinkets attached to its surface coincide with the names of the lives lost. Peter says people from the People’s History Museum came out in 2011 to put together an estimate for its conservation, a testament to its cultural significance. A representative from the museum called it “unique and irreplaceable”.The other banner spread out on the floor is his second memorial banner. “I tried to trigger all the senses with that banner,” he says. “First of all, everything changes on it. The new one says ‘We Never Walk Alone,’ meaning to say that’s us and the families, and included are the names of some survivors to put that in its place. The names on the new banner are the first names of those who were killed, in order to bring it closer.“Different materials have been used to try and carry the message through the touch of it. The names are all embroidered on black cloth so that they stand proud. There’s piping around each trophy, so you get a sense of the touch of the trophy. The flames are in silk so they shine. The lettering on the top is also in silk so it’s smooth and nice to touch. The bird is padded out and it has a smaller head to make it look young.”He looks down at his work. “It stands proud and has a depth to it. The ‘Hillsborough’ wording at the bottom is written in a material that has knots it’s quite rough to the touch. ‘April 15th 1989’ and ‘Sheffield’ have been put on because it always surprised me how many people didn’t know the date of the disaster or where Hillsborough actually was.” It even has pockets on it to hold flowers, triggering the sense of smell.The sky is perfectly blue when I meet Peter at the Cornerhouse Community Centre in Walton to have his banners photographed. As well as serving as a community hub and foodbank, the centre provides space and facilities for small businesses: ideal for a man who deals in massive pieces of fabric. Peter talks us through his collection, attaching flags to a fence with the knot skills of a man who has spent his life at sea. Goodison Park is only a short walk down the road. “We better hurry up before the bluenoses start throwing eggs,” jokes Peter.Peter has made more than 20 banners in the last 12 months alone – which he believes is some sort of record. He spent his birthday last year making one for Sean Cox, which the players posed with before their Champions League semi-final at Roma last season. “Sean got attacked and a mate of mine from Spirit of Shankly asked me to make a banner. It has ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ on it in Gaelic and Italian. I was trying to do the Gaelic to speak to Sean because I knew he was into Gaelic football, but the bottom line is: it feels the same whatever language it’s in.“I put loads of time into it. It’s worth it because it’s one of those things that could have happened to any one of us. One of the things I said that night was: ‘I pray he gets to see it and hope he gets to hold it.’ That still stands. It felt great that so many people were thinking of Sean when we’d just got through to the European Cup final. I thought that’s fucking brilliant, that.”Peter’s banners are about football – with slogans such as “Welcome To Wonderland” (“What’s the keeper called? Think about it lad!”) and “Robertson: Sweeter Than Jam” – but they are also about unity and empathy. He made a banner for the victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks that said “stay strong” in Maori and he made one for the victims of the Chapecoense plane crash.Central to all of Peter’s work is craft. He knows he could buy something online that has been made in a factory, but where’s the fun in that? He would miss out on battering with fabric merchants in Manchester, opening tins of acrylic paint, stencilling with the ends of vinyl car wraps, and roping in fellow Hillsborough survivors to help paint the odd bit here and there. He would miss the cramped attic workspace and, most of all, the chance to perfect a personal style. “For me, it’s about being able to express my support for the team,” he says. “It’s about expressing my belonging to the club, my vision for what’s going on and my ideas.”Show him a blank page and his banner senses will start tingling. He’ll lock on to a font, size it up using his vape as a guide and tell you that it would look fantastic in four-by-six on a banner. He’ll tell you about how his dad did wedding invitations on old postcards in a particular gothic font he has recreated on the “Jürgener Believers” banner and that he doesn’t care if you think he’s “a quilt” for enjoying the Great British Sewing Bee. He’ll tell you that the proper creativity will begin when he retires and can start mastering his own font, like what the Green Brigade have at Celtic Park. He loves their banners and what German fans do too.With craft in mind, Peter strings up his most impressive work to date: Destiny Delivered. “This is my masterpiece,” he says. “My Istanbul banner. Every technique you can use on a banner is on here: appliqué, reverse appliqué, painting, embroidery, silk screen printing, you name it, it’s on this banner. Not many banners have a municipal logo on them, do they?” Pride radiates from his smile. The banner even features the passport stamps from entering and departing Istanbul airport, a needle in a haystack level of detail most people would miss. Peter knows it’s there, though. That’s what matters.Peter’s work isn’t free of protest. Rooting through his archives – a collection of rucksacks, drawstring bags and plastic carriers crammed full – there’s what might be referred to as Peter’s paper period. “I made loads of paper banners for Gillett and Hicks when they were in charge at Anfield because they weren’t worth the cloth that my other banners are made from,” says Peter, pointing to a favourite.“Foster, one of their sons, was trying to make friends with the supporters in the local pub. When he turned up, they threw him out. So I made a banner, and it said: ‘Flea Forth With Foster \u0026amp Friends For Thine Fettered Finances Have Floundered’. Really, I just wanted to say ‘Fuck off!’ But if I had made a banner saying ‘Fuck off, Foster, ya fuckin’ knob’ it wouldn’t have got in many papers, would it? I think it got in the Independent. They were made up with it.”Peter Hooton, a lifelong Liverpool fan and member of the Spirit of Shankly fangroup that was set up in the Gillett and Hicks era, is full of praise for Peter. “He’s an artist, isn’t he? The Hillsborough one is the best one for me,” says Hooton. “Brilliant. Every name was embroidered on to it. He’s recording history in a way. It’s so stunning. It’s the Scouse Bayeux Tapestry. “Peter will go down in posterity. If I wanted someone to make a banner for my funeral, it’d be Peter Carney. He did one for Tommy Lawrence and Peter Thompson recently and the families were made up with them. They’re magnificent. He takes his time. He knows what he’s doing.”Banner culture has changed dramatically on the Kop over the years. As Hooton points out, the Union Flags of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s have become taboo. Whether it’s due to politics or a heightened sense of creativity, he’s not sure. Fans looked at football differently after Heysel and Hillsborough, with politics and an anti-establishment vigour rising to the fore.“A lot of people are brought up Catholic and that’s part of Liverpool’s DNA as well. Right-wingers called it ‘mawkish sentimentality’ but I think it’s the opposite. I think it’s what Thatcher was saying didn’t exist. I think it’s community. It’s the opposite of sentimentality it’s about community and support.”A few weeks later Peter is in Homebaked, a community bakery opposite Anfield where he is greeted like a celebrity by the staff. He’s here to hang a banner outside the ground to commemorate the late Tommy Smith. Between mouthfuls of the Shankly pie, he tells me that wind caught the banner while it was drying on the line and flicked white scabs of paint across its surface. Peter, a perfectionist, delicately picked each one off by hand until it looked brand new again.In biting cold and blustery wind, he takes utmost care to hang the banner as straight as possible around a pillar next to Anfield’s Hillsborough memorial. It must comfort Smith’s family to know their loved one played for a club that is followed so loyally and passionately. A passion so strong it leads people to use their spare time to honour a life with such craftsmanship and care.Shortly after, Peter gives me a glimpse of his tour. When he was made redundant from his job at the council, he cashed in some of the money and bought a minibus. Inspired by the city’s Magical Mystery Tour – a massive yellow coach that ferries tourists between Beatles sights – Peter started Soccer in the City, a matchday tour that takes in the city’s footballing history and landmarks. It’s fantastic. Few people know their stuff like Peter.That evening, before a Friday night match against Huddersfield, I meet up with Joe Connolly from the Spion Kop 1906 fangroup. Joe, who is in his late 20s, says Peter helps and supports the next generation of banner makers. “Our mate died around the time of the League Cup final in 2012 and we painted a flag for him at The Black-E in Liverpool,” says Joe.“It said: ‘RIP Alex, We Won It For You.’ Because Peter knew all the context and that, he helped us get the location to make it and helped us paint it. He texted us after saying: ‘You lot make me proud of the youth of this city.’ He’s definitely well respected by us and really well known. We see him as one of the forefathers of what we do.”That night Liverpool thump Huddersfield 5-0. The game starts the way it always does, with 50,000 people singing a rousing chorus amid a rippling ocean of red and white: a choreographed display of life, death, politics, protest, celebration and unity. Among it all are works of art by Peter Carney. After taking a long break, Peter’s next exhibition will be on a Friday night in early August.

I won by default and now have an £8,000 county court judgment (CCJ) against the company, SIN Building Services.It refuses to pay and as it is a limited company there seems little way to enforce it. There is no trading address to send bailiffs to and it has opened a new company to run accounts through.It is a member of the Federation of Master Builders, TradeMark and the Consumer Protection Association, all of whom say there is nothing they can do. They seem happy to represent members who don’t comply with building regulations or judgments. I am struggling to understand where the consumer’s rights come into the Consumer Rights Act when it cannot be enforced against limited companies and why the bodies claiming to regulate the industry seem to ignore the conduct of their members. Is there anything more I can do?SD, LondonYou have hit upon a major flaw in consumer protections, in that they only work when a company agrees to cooperate.Unscrupulous traders can breach a contract, ignore court orders and launch themselves as a new limited company to evade debts, and there’s very little customers can do.Aptly named, SIN is run by Sevdelin Nestorov and registered to an address in Croydon. He ignored the Observer’s requests for a comment but within days of my contact he renamed his company Lambdens.The original website should have set alarm bells ringing.

The FMB said its mediation service failed to achieve a resolution and it has expelled the company from its membership.Unfortunately, not a lot can be done with regards to enforcing the CCJ against the limited company unless you risk losing more money than you stand to gain.The best you can hope for is that it triggers a winding-up order, which would freeze the company assets until they have been distributed to creditors, but you may find yourself at the back of a very long queue. If the company goes into voluntary liquidation and the business reappears under a new company number, you are stymied, according to Morgan Lloyd of DAS Law.“Not a lot can be done with regards to enforcing the CCJ against the new company because your contract and the CCJ apply to the first trader,” he says.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

Music can be a lifeline – but only if venues and the industry improveAlthough special interests can pose challenges – for instance when they distract autistic people from their responsibilities – they are also described by many autistic people an important source of wellbeing, acting as a buffer to  anxiety and depression.Knight, a non-binary person who uses gender-neutral pronouns, says their ability to engage with a special interest can be hindered when the sensory issues accompanying their autism collide with the setup of many music venues. The anxiety-provoking combination of loud music and crowds means they struggle to attend gigs alone: “I go to a lot of gigs, and I tend to have to go with another person, or otherwise it’s even more stressful. Most of the time, I wear ear defenders, stand near the back and take very, very frequent breaks.”If Knight doesn’t take these steps, they may have to leave early. Inaccessible venues don’t help: “Autism brings me a lot of fatigue, and not having spaces to sit down is really difficult. It would be nice to not have to ask for a chair, and some venues don’t even have chairs, which is ridiculous.”There is an overlap between autistic access requirements and those of people with other conditions, such as chronic fatigue. Although not all people diagnosed with autism identify as disabled, many autism advocates do, and think their struggle is linked to accessibility for disabled people in general.For example, Robin Jax, an autistic Leamington musician, cites commentary made by “the wider disability rights people I follow on Twitter” on the inaccessibility of DIY music venues as relevant to autistic people: “You put it all together, but did you put it together for everyone? No, because you have to go through several flights of stairs, the lights are nonexistent or too much, the way that things are laid out is often very confusing.”Disabled people are protected by the Equality Act 2010, which stipulates that businesses provide “reasonable adjustments” to make venues accessible. The difficulty is that autism is hugely varied – it’s often said by neuroersity advocates often say that if you’ve met one autistic person, you’ve met one autistic person – and it is hard to provide a one-size-fits-all solution. Overwhelmed by the number of issues raised by the access needs of autistic concertgoers, some may be reluctant to make changes, particularly if they lack resources. But there are simple, inexpensive adjustments venues could make.Earplugs, for example, are a lifesaver for many autistic people as well as a necessity for many concertgoers who wants to avoid hearing damage. But although some venues say earplugs are available on request, hearing protection at gigs is by no means ubiquitous.Rowland Straylight, a musician and DJ with Asperger syndrome who is based in Leeds, says: “I have lost track of the number of times I’ve had to explain that I’m carrying a pack of earplugs and not some kind of drug paraphernalia.” Normalising the use of hearing protection would be of particular benefit to autistic people who are sensitive to loud sounds, but it would enhance the wellbeing of all concertgoers.Some of the people who have made music more accessible to autistic people are on the spectrum themselves. Robin Jax founded Tiergarten Records – a label for “neuroerse musicians” – providing an outlet for autistic artists to get their work heard. He defines neuroerse as “having a brain that functions in ways that erge significantly from the dominant societal standards of normal”. The label is small, based in Robin’s home, but it releases music in both digital and physical formats. “As far as I’m aware, it is the only neuroerse record label in the world, or one specifically around the themes of neuroersity and neuroergence.”He recommends training for people working in the industry so that they’re more aware of the challenges autistic people can experience. Robin also says that unspoken music industry norms need to be made more clearcut so that autistic employees, who may struggle to intuit what’s expected of them, aren’t placed at a disadvantage.There are charities working to enhance accessibility for autistic gig-goers. Attitude Is Everything (AiE) has worked since 2000 to champion the inclusion of disabled music fans, providing training and consultancy on accessibility as well as free online guidance. Helen Ellis, who is autistic and works as an equality, ersity, and inclusion Coordinator for the National Autistic Society, suggests a few simple ways the music industry can show its commitment to autistic concertgoers: “Publicising details about venues in advance, letting fans know if flashing lights are going to be used at any point and booking venues that have accessible seating.”Social isolation isn’t an inevitable part of being autistic. Engaging with music, either as a hobby or professionally, is one of many ways autistic people can create connections with others ⁠– but only if they’re given the chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a177e4e279b7cef976157eb2ba700219383b8d8/365_135_3902_2341/master/3902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28ea3d32bd4c85e6de1b8e0778ef43fa","title":"kiss review birmingham arena","story":"Birmingham ArenaUnder reams of confetti and pyrotechnics, the face-painted rock gods have enough bangers to go out with a bangNot quite 20 years after Kiss performed their “farewell tour”, here they are donning their face paint to say goodbye again. The notoriously big-business American quartet have never been shy of making another buck. Their infamous merchandise range stretches from $1,000 meet-and-greet packages to “air guitar strings” – an empty bag bearing the Kiss logo, yours for $3.99. This definitely, probably, possibly final End of the Road tour has already grossed an approximate $50m (£40m).However, they certainly don’t spare the cash when it comes to putting on a show. Forty-odd years after they trailblazed the idea of the rock gig as a huge, touring theatrical production, their current show has hydraulic stages, sparks-shooting guitars, lasers and so many pyrotechnics that the self-styled “hottest band in the world” tag could refer to the temperature on stage. Stack-heeled, body-armoured bassist Gene Simmons, 70 next month, breathes fire during War Machine, spits theatrical blood in God of Thunder and wiggles his infamous tongue during Lick It Up. Vocalist Paul Stanley, from the Mick JaggerDavid Johansen school of strutting, pouting, camp heterosexual rock god, is an engaging if now occasionally slightly croaky presence.The music hasn’t changed much since 1976. And not much changes during the two-hour set, which offers permutations of loud glam-metal, chanted inanities (“Get up! Get down!”) and lyrics about rock’n’roll and partying. There are certainly moments (notably Psycho Circus) when visual thrills can’t disguise the fact that Kiss can be a mundane, dated rock band. And yet, the “Kissarmy” of fans of all ages never stop grinning and air-punching.Just as the show starts flagging, the bangers arrive like cavalry. Stanley flies on a zip wire to the centre of the audience for the sublime disco-rock I Was Made for Loving You. Drummer Eric Singer sings atypical ballad Beth at a silver piano. Crazy, Crazy Nights and the stupidly anthemic Rock \u0026amp Roll All Nite see ticker tape, confetti cannons and even more fireworks as rock’s real-life cartoon characters go out with a bang.

If only he’d have set this out in December, when Theresa May was struggling to get the withdrawal agreement through Parliament. The whole approach by everyone would have been different for the first half of 2019, and we wouldn’t be facing the imminent threat of Boris Johnson as PM. SimonLegendThis is just a different way of sitting on the fence. The indecision and confusion continue. PaperAxeLabour has actually always been remarkably consistent about its Brexit policy. People may not like Labour’s Brexit policy, they may wish that it were different. Plenty of people within the party fall into those categories. But it is just disingenuous to say that Labour doesn’t have a position or that its position is unclear.Corbyn is just spelling out what has been said many times before: the ideal scenario is a general election, a Labour victory and Brexit on Labour’s terms. Failing that, a second referendum and backing remain (for now). PortalooCorbyn has done the right thing in finally coming out in support of remain in a second referendum. If a handful of Tories stick with their principles and vote with Labour a second referendum would hopefully give us a clear remain vote. Pull us back from the last three years of utter madness that have alienated us from allies and weakened the fabric of society that binds us all. Kingpin300Labour’s so-called policy change on Brexit is no such thing. Their policy is still to back a Labour Brexit deal but oppose a Tory Brexit deal. We’ve known that for some time. Labour didn’t back May’s EU withdrawal agreement, and backed amendments for another referendum in parliament.To say that Labour will oppose a Tory Brexit, but support a Labour Brexit deal, is simply no change at all. BudaneveyThe absolute proof of the pudding for Labour – and the only way they will win back support – is to now be seen to actively and aggressively promote a second referendum as a solution. Simply announcing it as a policy position and then going back to talking about buses is not anywhere near enough. There has to be genuine commitment. SmallHeathernThe fact that in July 2019, Labour feels it has to state they would campaign for remain against no-deal or a Tory deal speaks volume about the level of irrelevance they have fallen to regarding Brexit.In the fine print, they also say that in the unlikely event of an emergency landing of Corbyn in Number 10, they would not revoke Article 50 but seek for another deal with the EU (the same deal but painted red). ID7903204I am now watching Labour closely. If this turns out to be what it is trying to look like they may have my vote again. But I am not going to give my support until it is absolutely clear that there is no between the lines Lexit hidden here.But on what’s been said so far, I will vote with Labour in the event of GE. Lynden71I see nothing in Labour’s recent policy announcement on Brexit that’s going to make want to switch back to supporting them. Apart from anything else, Corbyn simply can’t be trusted to see through what he’s currently promising. I’m half-expecting a half-retraction later today, rowing back on the pledge. GalvestonPeople don’t understand that Corbyn coming out and supporting remain will boost the Tories. They’ve been praying for Corbyn to play the big remain bogeyman for three years and he has (correctly) refrained to doing this. This announcement will fuel the Conservatives who still (probably) hold a very slim majority. What’s for sure is that both the Tories and the anti-Corbynites have been trying to set up Corbyn for failure ever since he got the Labour PLP.Seeing the absolute derision with which this is being met in the Remain camp ... it’s quite clear that all the Corbyn bashing of the last three years has worked wonders. Voltaire21Seems fair. Corbyn coming under a lot of attacks, but there is very little else they can do. As opposition, they cannot trigger a general election or demand a new referendum even if they want to, because the power to do so lies solely in the hands of the Conservatives.The referendum should never have happened, and ever since that date, Corbyn and the Labour party should have come out clearly in favour of the half the country that voted remain, knowing what a Tory Brexit would mean. That they didn’t is on them.But at this point, and with a Johnson government looming on the horizon, I don’t really see what else they could do than try to force his hand, which is the purpose of today’s letter. danielplainview"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae6c7d1d4c2f238aecacb93ec0ad62ca157a8f8/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a74a30c0ca4dc527ec095a0553202579 2020w","title":"australia australianism hard predict england win","story":"My youngest is three weeks old now, just enough already to know the best and worst of English cricket. She was born right around the time they beat Afghanistan, came home on the day they lost against Sri Lanka, and her first match – the one I watched while she sat on my lap – was that bleak and dispiriting defeat against Australia at Lord’s. “No, no this team are different,” I said when Eoin Morgan flapped a catch to fine leg and his side were 26 for three, “really, they can still win this”. She gave me one of those quizzical looks babies make while they’re learning how to work their face, like she wanted to say: “Unlike you, I wasn’t born yesterday.”Well, since then there have been those back-to-back wins against India and New Zealand, and England seem to have arrived at the semi-finals full of confidence. Which seems just a touch rash, since – as you, me, and everyone else who’s ever watched them knows – it’s the hope that gets you in the end. Australia may have lost that last match against South Africa, they may be playing at a ground, Edgbaston, where they haven’t won since they crushed England by an innings and 118 runs in 2001 (Steve Waugh 105, Damien Martyn 105, Adam Gilchrist 152, Shane Warne eight for 100, and doesn’t that make you wince), and they may have suffered that sudden flurry of injuries – broken arms, pulled hamstrings, side strains.But they still have one great advantage over everyone else: they are Australia. Which means there is a part of me, as there must be in every longstanding England fan, that’s half-sure they will somehow end up stronger for whatever changes they have to make. It might be Peter Handscomb, who was averaging 43 at a run a ball in one-day cricket this year before they dropped him from the squad, or Matthew Wade, who, playing for their A team, has just blazed 117 off 67 balls against Northamptonshire and 155 off 71 against Derbyshire, or even Mitch Marsh, who swept up five for 33 the last time he played against England in a World Cup. (Gary Ballance 10, Ian Bell 36, Joe Root 5, Eoin Morgan 0, Jos Buttler 10, England 231 all out. Think of this as exposure therapy.)Because it is never just Australia’s batting, bowling, fielding, England have to overcome, it is what John Arlott once called their “Australianism”, too, and the perpetual threat that someone is going to pull an Andy Bichel on you. “Where the impossible is within the realm of what the human body can do, there are Australians who believe they can do it,” wrote Arlott, “and who have succeeded often enough to make us wonder if anything is impossible to them.” Which, perhaps, says as much about how the English have learned to watch cricket as it does about how the Australians have learned to play it.Arlott traced this neurosis back to the Ashes match in 1882, when Australia collapsed in their second innings from 66 for none to 122 all out. During the innings break their famous, feared fast bowler Fred “the Demon” Spofforth is supposed to have said: “This thing can be done.”And then, to show it could, he went and did it. He snatched the match with seven for 44, “in the face of all cricket probability and 11 great English cricketers”. England were bowled out for 77 and lost by eight runs.Ever since, Arlott wrote, “when England are winning we have dreaded an Australian recovery – for every Australian seems capable of saving his side – and when Australia have been on top then we have felt, in our hearts, that they would never relax”. England’s women, flattened three-nil in the first three matches of this year’s Ashes, are learning about this all over again right now.It occurs to me now, midway through all this, that it might not be quite the sort of peppy read I probably should have turned in the day before the game, less “here-we-go-then” than “here-we-go-again”.Morgan and Trevor Bayliss, plus their coaches and psychologists, will be trying to drum this thinking out of England this week. Even if they have to fake it to make it happen. In Channel 4’s documentary The Greatest Series, which went out on Sunday night, Michael Vaughan said they had done exactly that in 2005. He talked about how insecure he and his teammates felt that summer, and if we didn’t necessarily guess it from watching them, Vaughan explained, that was because they were all busy pretending they were sure of themselves.Well, since all I have to do is watch, I will let him keep his optimism. I’ve tried it on for size, and it doesn’t suit nearly so well as my inveterate Eeyorism. I told myself, and everyone else, Australia were there for the taking before the start of the tournament, then I said it again during their game against West Indies at Trent Bridge, when they were 79 for five, and one last time, right before they thrashed England at Lord’s.So now it has come down to England needing to beat them in a semi-final, I have given up on this wishful thinking. Think of it as a public service. I have decided to spare us all another woeful prediction. Expect the worst. It is less painful that way, and, yes, may turn out more surprising, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb10fe665dbd788a130cd416fd4c465357ef652/0_110_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c77b5127e98d1be2dfc7130cfb8d3ec","title":"india v new zealand cricket world cup 2019 semi final resumes live","story":"35th over: India 119-6 (Dhoni 20, Jadeja 15) Santner returns, and Jadeja and Dhoni do some fine running, though a very slightly better throw to Santner might have had Jadeja in trouble after he was ordered to turn back by his team-mate, rather than go for a second. “So the ICC arrange an entire World Cup model, and eliminate many other countries from even playing for the benefit of India staying in as long as possible,” writes Darnel Harris, “and they ... do this?”33rd over: India 106-6 (Dhoni 14, Jadeja 9) Six runs! Neesham replaced Santner, and Jadeja clobbers him down the ground. The over ends with a bonus run, as the fielder’s throw hits the wicket with the batsmen having settled for a single and deflects far enough away to let them scamper another.32nd over: India 97-6 (Dhoni 12, Jadeja 2) Boult returns the required run rate rises. They’re surely not going to meander out of the World Cup at three runs an over?31st over: India 94-6 (Dhoni 10, Jadeja 1) Santner has pretty much delivered the same ball 36 times in his six overs. A couple of hours ago I read a suggestion on Twitter that Williamson might be refraining from bowling him for fear that he would be slogged around the ground. Now he’s taken two wickets for seven runs in six overs. “What would happen if the scores are tied at 50 overs on 239 for 8?” asks Kim Thonger. “The match between the two sides in the group stage was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Would it be decided on the toss of a coin?” The head-to-head record isn’t used in any circumstances: I believeHardik Pandya top-edges a wild slog and Williamson runs back at midwicket to collect the ball as it comes down from orbit!30th over: India 92-5 (Pandya 32, Dhoni 10) Pandya keeps rubbing the small of his back. He has already needed the physio on in this innings to hand over a pill, presumably a painkiller. So that doesn’t help. Seven off Neesham’s fourth over, the first in 10 overs to go for more than four (and they only did that once). And India do indeed need exactly 148 from 20 overs!“Dhoni resembles more than anything else a tired old general fighting the last war,” writes Sankaran Krishna. “This tuk-tuk approach ratchets up the pressure on poor Hardik and any non-striker - followed by a headrush dismissal and then Dhoni’s inability to deliver in the final push. Sad.”29th over: India 85-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 5) Dhoni has faced 20 deliveries for his five runs. He is spectacularly unflustered. 28th over: India 83-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 3) Pandya turns to Ferguson after ducking his way out of a bouncer, smiles and gives him a thumbs up. That’s good sport. The required run rate is now above 7 (7.13, to be precise). “Looks like India are trying to get to 91 after 30 overs, just so they can chase down 148 from 20 and prove a point,” says Samuel. 27th over: India 82-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 2) Santner has conceded three runs in four overs, but he’s on the slide: two maidens to start, but two runs off this one alone. He’s practically falling apart. “A friend outside the ground has been told despite them having thousands of tickets, they can’t sell them to walk-ups,” reports Tom Watkins. “Cricket doesn’t really help itself does it?”26th over: India 80-5 (Pandya 29, Dhoni 1) The required run rate is approaching seven. India have scored 10 in the last seven overs. “Can we revert to chasing 148 from 20 overs? Asking on behalf of a friend,” writes Deepak Puri. 24th over: India 75-5 (Pandya 25, Dhoni 1) Crikey, the tension. MS Dhoni can get this done. He can also go at three an over until it’s too late to change direction. Let’s see.23rd over: India 71-5 (Pandya 22, Dhoni 0) India had scored one run from the 16 balls that preceded the wicket. Santner had bowled 10 successive dots. Finally Pant decided that drastic action had to be taken, and that was the last decision he’ll have to take today. Thus this becomes the third wicket maiden of the innings.The partnership is broken! Pant tries to hoist Santner over midwicket but he doesn’t get enough on it, and De Grandhomme takes a straightforward catch!22nd over: India 71-4 (Pant 32, Pandya 22) A single off Neesham, and the required run rate is above six for the first time today. I must say that an impressive number of yesterday’s ticket-holders have managed to wangle another free day in Manchester, with significant gaps visible only in the giant Foster’s Party Stand.21st over: India 70-4 (Pant 31, Pandya 22) Had play started at 6.30pm last night, India would have had to score 148 in 20 overs. Now they’re at less than half that total after 21. Santner bowls for the first time, and it’s a maiden.20th over: India 70-4 (Pant 31, Pandya 22) Pandya clips to Ferguson at long leg and goes for two. It would have been the end of him, had Ferguson’s throw been more accurate, or more flat of trajectory. Then Pant gets a thick edge on the last, which runs to the third man boundary. 19th over: India 62-4 (Pant 27, Pandya 19) Ferguson’s first balls are incredible. This time it rises sharply over Pant’s dangling bat. “This innings reminds me of when my brother beat the shit out of me when I was little, and I asked him to stop, but he didn’t,” writes Subhankar Pasalapudi (a couple of overs ago, to be fair, before this pair started making life look just a little less dismal for India). 18th over: India 60-4 (Pant 25, Pandya 19) De Grandhomme is milked like an old dairy cow. Nine off the over in ones and twos (plus a wide).17th over: India 51-4 (Pant 24, Pandya 12) Having nearly got a wicket with the first ball of his first over, Ferguson nearly gets another with the first ball of his third. Pandya completely mistimes a pull shot and top-edges just over the head of the fielder at midwicket! “I’d like to take issue with your publication of Asif Gil’s mails (overs 14 and 15),” writes Ant Pease. “Since when has the OBO been a home for poorly typed gibberish from the public?”16th over: India 47-4 (Pant 23, Pandya 10) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Henry, and when Pandya cuts the ball firmly Martin Guptill es high to his left to get his palm on the ball he doesn’t hold it, but he does turn four runs into one. 15th over: India 43-4 (Pant 20, Pandya 9) One run from Ferguson’s second over. India need 5.6 an over from here on in. Asif Gil emails again. “rrrrrrr4 thee,” he says. I think his phone might be broken. 14th over: India 42-4 (Pant 19, Pandya 9) Pandya times one past cover, where the fielder es but misjudges the bouncing ball and so can’t stop it going for four. “I am ga gyrrrrrrr4crtrtrrrweswrr rsseeeederregwvydseytt a rrrrrrr4crtrtrrrweswsseeeederregwvv,” writes Asif Gil. I know how you feel, Asif.13th over: India 37-4 (Pant 19, Pandya 5) DROPPED! Lockie Ferguson’s first delivery is hit by Pant straight to Neesham, author of a world-class catch but minutes ago, at short midwicket. It comes at him fast, for sure, but that was a pretty ho-hum, run-of-the-mill catch, chest high, just to his right.12th over: India 35-4 (Pant 18, Pandya 4) Rishabh Pant is playing a different game to everybody else, going at not far off a run a ball and looking pretty untroubled doing so. He pulls one for four, and then pushes through cover. Santner es to his left to stop it, and returns the ball so quickly that what seemed a straightforward single ends the batsman desperately ing to make his ground.10th over: India 24-4 (Pant 12, Pandya 0) Another boundary, Pant hitting a lovely shot through the covers. There’s some encouragement here for India’s batsmen, but they’re not sticking around long enough to exploit it. The wicket falls from the last ball of the powerplay: prior to today India had lost four wickets in the opening 10 overs across the entire tournament they’ve now equalled that total in less than an hour.What a grab! Diving low to his left, with his arm fully extended, Jimmy Neesham plucks the ball out of the air about an inch from the ground, and then manages to pivot his hand so it protects the ball from the turf! Phenomenal!9th over: India 19-3 (Pant 7, Karthik 6) Runs for Karthik! He finally gets off the mark, from his 21st delivery, as he works one between third slip - that’s right, three slips - and point and gets four for it. And then a couple off the last for good measure.7th over: India 10-3 (Pant 5, Karthik 0) Another maiden from Boult, who has one wicket for three runs from four overs. It ends with a gorgeous inswinging yorker, which doesn’t quite inswing enough.5th over: India 6-3 (Pant 1, Karthik 0) Boult bowls a tempter across Karthik, similar to the delivery from Henry that did for Sharma, but this time the batsman leaves it. Then Pant raises his bat to a ball that comes back into him and, as he goes down on one knee, clips his chest on its way through. There’s a loud lbw appeal, but a shake of the head from the umpire, and no review. This is the first time in the entire history of ODI cricket that the top three batsmen have all been out for one run.4th over: India 5-3 (Pant 0, Karthik 0) Another wicket maiden, as India falter in the face of Boult and Henry’s early-innings assault. “Everyone has talked about Boult in the build up to this morning, they seem to have forgotten Henry took 75 wickets at 15.48 in the CC last season, most of which were in very similar conditions to this,” notes Chris Parker. Another edge, and an easy catch for Latham! Scenes!3rd over: India 5-2 (Rahul 1, Pant 0) Kohli goes after Boult’s first ball, but gets nothing on it as it whistles well wide of off stump. Two dots follow, and then another ball Kohli gets nothing on, and this one would have hit the stumps! Kohli’s average in three World Cup semi-finals is 3.66. Wicket maiden. What. A. Start.The ball would have clipped the bails on its way through, and India’s captain has gone!It looked a very good shout to me. This is massive ...2nd over: India 5-1 (Rahul 1, Kohli 1) Kohli edges his first ball, but it goes straight to ground. “Good morning and, weatherwise, we can say that with confidence,” writes John Starbuck. “Given that tomorrow’s forecasts are for thunderstorms, how ready are we for play on reserve-day Friday too? Got the cards ready?” The forecast for Birmingham tomorrow does look very poor indeed, and it looks at the moment like play on Friday is likely.Beauty! After three successive World Cup centuries, Rohit Sharma has gone for one, pushing at the ball and feathering an edge to the keeper!1st over: India 2-0 (Rahul 1, Sharma 1) The innings starts with a sharp single to mid-off, well run. But there’s just another single to follow, and the over ends with four dots.The players are back out. 240 to get. Trent Boult has the ball in his hand, and New Zealand need some magic from him this morning. Game on.So India need 4.8 an over from 50 overs to claim a place in the final. I imagine they’d have taken that 24 hours ago.50th over: New Zealand 239-8 (Santner 9, Boult 3) A single for Santner off the first, then a bouncer beats Boult. He then bashes the next to midwicket for a couple, an ugly shot but it’ll do, and follows that with a single. Santner has the strike, with two to face. The first goes to mid-on, where it’s well fielded but they run a couple, and he gets nothing but pad on the last. They run a leg bye, and India’s target is 240!49th over: New Zealand 232-8 (Santner 5, Boult 0) Mitch Santner gets the day’s first boundary, spearing through the covers for four. But then Henry tries to smack the last ball of the over over the long on boundary but gets nowhere near enough on it, and Kohli takes a straightforward catch!Jadeja’s at it again! He takes an excellent high catch at deep midwicket, and he’s essentially taken two wickets in two balls!48th over: New Zealand 225-5 (Latham 10) Bumrah starts his day with a full toss, which Taylor only converts into a single. With so many fielders in the deep, if they manage to get bat on ball a single is inevitable, and two likely. Eight off the over, despite that run-out off the last.That’s an extraordinary bit of fielding from Jadeja! The batsmen come back for a second run and it seems straightforward, but Jadeja runs in from deep square leg and hits the stumps from side-on and a distance of 40 yards!47th over: New Zealand 217-5 (Taylor 70, Latham 6) A single for Taylor, and then a yorker that’s too good for Latham. The next goes down to long leg, and the batsmen manage to run a fairly comfortable two thanks to some half-hearted fielding. Another one and a two makes six off the first five balls of the day, with Taylor on strike for the start of over 48.“If New Zealand score 30 runs from their remaining overs, it’s a bad sign for them I think, because it means the pitch is good for batting and India are also likely get the required runs from their 50 overs,” writes Mark van Raaij. “If, on the contrary, NZ struggle to add to their total, they might be able to also put India in trouble.” So let me get this straight: the worse New Zealand do, the better New Zealand are doing?The players are out now, so either way, we’re about to find out.If you get tired of the glitz and glamour of World Cup cricket, here’s Tanya Aldred with the County blog:“Trying to think of a less appealing challenge in world cricket than coming in cold this morning to try and hit sixes off Bhuvi and Bumrah yorkers,” says Lawrence White. “There can’t be much worse?” It’s a nasty assignment, to be sure, and there won’t be many worse. Perhaps defending 230 against Sharma and Kohli?Apparently Bhuvi Kumar, who will start the day by bowling the final five deliveries of his ninth over, has been practising yorkers this morning.Even further pre-play reading: here’s Andy Bull on the one great advantage Australia have over their World Cup rivals:“A score of 240+ and an early wicket will mean New Zealand can book tickets to London,” suggests Krish. “Else the tag of eternal semi finalists can come to haunt them.” I think they’re a bit below par, and the fact that 12 of their last 23 balls will be bowled by Bumrah isn’t encouraging, but as you say if they can score another 30 runs and take a couple of early wickets they’re back in the game.Further pre-play reading: ICC says outbreak of unusually slow pitches at this World Cup is just coincidence and nothing to do with them:We’re back! There’s unfinished business to be done in Manchester after yesterday’s rain, which mercifully continued just long enough to prevent a potentially ludicrous 20-over Indian run chase being awkwardly squeezed into the evening. That would certainly have improved New Zealand’s chances of prevailing this outcome does the opposite. They have to click immediately and seamlessly into top gear this morning as they attempt to turn 211-5 into a defendable total in the space of only 23 balls. In particular Ross Taylor, who had finally started to score fairly freely after a slow start when the rain fell, has to go big from the off.The forecast is (fairly) good and a winner has to be found. Welcome, and here’s Vic Marks on yesterday’s action.

Toms Skujins was second over and took one. 133km to go: The gap between the four-man breakaway and the peloton is 1min 54sec, but Peter Sagan’s Bora Hansgrohe team are at the front of the bunch and keeping the escapees on a tight rein. Remember, Tim Wellens, who is in the breakaway, is wearing the King of the Mountains jersey and will be hoping to hoover up a few more points this afternoon. 139km to go: The race has settled down after a frantic start, which gives me time to check the General Classification. The Australian rider, Simon Clarke, is the highest placed of those in the breakaway. He’s currently 73rd in the standings, 5min 04sec behind the maillot jaune Julian Alaphilippe. 146km to go: Four men escape, while plenty more who will have been ordered to make sure they got in any breakaway today will be resigned to having to face the wrath of angry directeurs sportifs later this evening. Chapeau then, to Messrs Wellens, Schmidt Wurtz, Skujins and Clarke. 153km to go: We finally appear to have our breakaway group. Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal), Mads Schmidt Wurtz (Katusha Alpecin), Toms Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Simon Clarke (EF Education First) make a break for it and are allowed to bolt into the distance. 154km to go: Our intrepid trio continue their escape bid, but are finally caught again. Thomas De Gent has expended plenty of energy in this stage already but is still in the pack. 157km to go: Thomas De Gendt (Lotto Soudal), Jan Tratnik (Bahrain Merida) and Benoît Cosnefroy (AG2R La Mondiale) open a gap of about 10 seconds on the chasing pack. 160km to go: It’s been a frantic first 15 kilometres, particularly at the front of the peloton. Thomas De Gent leads another jailbreak with two co-conspirators, but it doesn’t look like his third attempt to escape will be any more successful than his previous two. 162km to go: Patrick Konrad (Bora Hansgrohe), Nils Politt (Katusha Alpecin), Anthony Perez (Cofidis) and Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal), among others, form an eight breakaway but are caught before I can finish identifying them and typing out their names. We’re still waiting for the day’s first successful escape. 167km to go: Wearing the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens is one of four riders who puts some distance between themselves and the bunch. Aime De Gent and Alex Gougeard are with him. 168km to go: Thomas De Gent makes another escape bid but doesn’t get away. The bunch remains intact, but is mightily strung out towards the front as assorted riders put the hammer down. 169km to go: Unwilling to let the breakaway escape, the peloton reels them in before they can snap the line and escape. 171km to go: The race has yet to settle and our seven breakaway riders have just been joined by an eighth, while four others are still trying to bridge. 174km to go: Seven riders have escaped and three others are trying to bridge the gap from the peloton. They’re on the move: The riders have set off from Saint-Dié-des-Vosges , where they were bid adieu by a huge crowd. Christian Prudhomme has emerged from the sunroof of his red Skoda, waved his yellow flag and racing has begun. Thomas De Gent and six other riders have immediately tried to make a break for it. No abandonments so far: With 650.6 kilometres behind the field after four stages, every single one of the 176 riders who started the 106th Tour de France on Saturday is all still racing.Stage three’s diary was soundtracked by David Gray and today it’s Razorlight. Whoever is in charge of this Aussie team’s social media department needs to have a word with themselves. Today’s roll-out: The field will get moving out of Saint-Dié-des-Vosges at 12.25pm (BST) before getting the signal to begin racing from race director Christian Prudhomme some 10 minutes or so later. He’s certainly not everybody’s cup of tea, but Lance Armstrong’s stage-by-stage analysis on his Tour de France podcast is well worth the time of those prepared to look beyond his well documented past and accept that he might actually know what he’s talking about. Armstrong isn’t afraid to pull punches in his daily chats with his former team-mate George Hincapie and pal JB Hager. It often makes for very interesting listening indeed.Orla Chennaoui was posing the questions as Adam Blythe and Brian Smith picked over the bones of stage four on Eurosport yesterday. It was a show that will not have made for pleasant viewing for Team Jumbo-Visna and their sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, who got quite the savaging. Elia Viviani sprinted to his maiden Tour de France stage victory, Julian Alaphilippe retained the yellow jersey and defending champion Geraint Thomas played down what some have described as the very sloppy loss of five seconds on the previous day.From William Fotheringham’s stage-by-stage guide: Best described as Vosges-lite, skirting three sides of the massif with two second and two third category climbs to shake up the pack. There is a good chance that an early escape will stay away today as keeping a team chasing will be hard in the tough finale – two climbs in the final 35km – while behind the move the peloton will be whittled down to 30 or 40. A good day for a strong breakaway rider such as Thomas De Gendt or Matej Mohoric, one where the favourites will want to avoid losing time or expending too much energy, with day six in mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68795c9abd0e6552f20af70d71a6458786b4fd6f/0_1264_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f32ea55c205acbcf1bfc7eb27cefa4","title":"black country humour george fouracres","story":"The region has long been a national punchline. Funny, then, that it’s where you’ll find some of the country’s sharpest witsIf ever, on a weekend, I get the train out of London and up through the countryside, I watch the buildings turn from stained cream to red brick. I see the reedy banks of water carrying herons and rainbow barge boats up towards locks and squat black lacquer bridges. The familiar shattered factories of Sandwell show up, followed by lorry depots, gas-canister clusters and (weirdly) a single perennial skip fire that herald the arrival to Wolverhampton station – home. Then I make a beeline straight for a certain pub.It’s in a Black Country town called Bilston. A small flat-roofed pub, on a small high street, opposite a big Lidl. It has live music eight times a week (twice on a Sunday). Jazz. The pub is always packed to the rafters. As you order a pint of Holden’s Bitter or Golden Glow, and possibly a pack of pork scratchings (at least two, in my case), your earholes will fill with two things. One, a muffled trombone that’s seen too many winters. Two, laughter. Tables full of Black Country folk spending two minutes out of every five telling a story or a joke then laughing for the remaining three. The rhythm is as steady as the drummer in the corner. It never breaks. If you’re not joking or laughing, you’re basically not breathing.It has always been this way. It has been this way since my dad was dossing around Darlaston on his chopper since my grandad was learning to lay bricks in Willenhall since my great-grandad was cutting his teeth in a foundling home. It’s an integral, unshakable, unbreakable part of our history. Which is a bit weird, because our history only really began relatively recently.The Black Country is where the Industrial Revolution kicked off in earnest. At the start of the 18th century, a small rural parcel of central England, largely dedicated to woolpacking and the occasional bit of ironmongery, exploded into life as the forge of the British empire. Ironworks, steelworks, brickworks, coal shafts, coke kilns and glass cones were jam-packed into an area of a 14-mile radius, with a network of canals – or “cuts” – carrying their produce, along with chains, nails, locks, traps, anchors and plenty else to the four corners of the world. Before that, there was a smattering of shenanigans in the civil war, some murmurings about Catholic recusants after the reformation, and a single, prominent battle in the 10th century.I don’t know if our sense of humour arrived with the Anglo-Saxons who settled the area, but the dialect did. Essentially, it’s Mercian, heavily Germanic, with vowel sounds and verb structures that resisted the influence of Norse, Norman and Middle English. Knock about Halesowen or Wednesbury for a bit, and you’ll hear a bloke in a beanie hat and a zip-up coat order chips in much the same way as a flaxen-haired bearded spear-thane. If they’d had potatoes back then. Or ordered what they wanted, rather than pillaging it.And so we have these jokes! Thousands of them, all in dialect, often featuring two flat-capped goons called Aynuk and Ayli, who get into scrapes and mishaps. There’s usually dialect wordplay involved (“Arv bin fishin in the cut! Caught a whale day I!” “What kinda whale?” “A bicycle whale!”), and the punchline is usually sardonic (Aynuk saw Ayli walking down the road pulling a piece of string. Aynuk: “Wot am yow doin pullin that pace o’string?” Ayli: “Well yow troi pushin it”). They’re learned by heart, by ear and by word of mouth. People recognise and remember them in the same way they do hymns and prayers. They’re the main form that our dialect survives in.We’re big on family, and our families are usually big. In a family, there’s always a chief piss-tekker. Someone with a devastatingly quick wit who can prick pomposity and tension with razor-sharp precision. In my family this would be my Uncle Bill. Then there’s the target. Usually the most earnest or self-important relative. Mercilessly but good-naturedly ribbed. They nearly always deserve it. I’d reluctantly admit that’s me. Everyone else is on a sliding scale between those two poles. No time is inappropriate for a joke. No burn is too sick. Here’s a good example. A bloke round our way, called Tommy, a painter and decorator, was known for being tight (one of the worst crimes possible in the Black Country). He was so tight that rather than take the day off on Christmas Day, he used the opportunity to clean his brushes with turps in the kitchen. Unfortunately his wife was cooking the turkey at the time. Long story short, his house burned down. Lost absolutely everything. On Boxing Day he walks into the pub, everyone falls silent, and without skipping a beat Uncle Bill pipes up with: “What yow ad fer Christmas Tommy, a blazer?” I think even Tommy laughed.You’ll rarely meet a miserable Black Country person (at least not one who’s not witty and sarcastic), which is odd considering our history hasn’t given us much to be joyful about. Our traditions are born of the working class, with working conditions in factories, foundries and pits notoriously dire. Lung diseases such as pneumoconiosis were rife, along with deafness and spinal deformities. And yet you won’t find a more genial, hard-working people. Maybe finding something to “av a loff abaat” was a way of expressing love for a world that didn’t always seem to love us back. Even now the Black Country is often the punchline for a sneery joke about a place that’s shit. Or – more darkly – a place that’s multicultural and therefore, in the eyes of the joker, synonymously shit. You’d be surprised how often I’ve heard “Is it called the Black Country because of all the black people there?” from people who should really know better.Not a day goes by that I don’t think of or talk about home, and smile. Of course, Black Country folk aren’t by nature self-reflective people and many of them would probably tell you this article’s a pile of auld wank. “Wot’s he gooin on abaat?! If it’s funny it’s funny ay it!” Fair enough. Some purists will even tell you that as a Willenhall lad, thanks to the conurbation with Wolvo, I don’t qualify as Black Country, not having been born within the necessary 46cm radius of their great-grandfather’s old wellington boot in West Bromwich. Don’t listen to them.I told my dad I was writing this and asked him (at the pub) what makes our sense of humour so distinctive. He thought for a minute, sipped his beer, and said: “Everyone round here thinks they’m a comedian.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c00b84d9b4f7e12e6fb1030f4664e4a82cce7107/0_103_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5dababcbcb080988607cb1da74cd99f","title":"fleabag super producer francesca moody phoebe waller bridge edinburgh fringe","story":"She unleashed Phoebe Waller-Bridge on the Edinburgh fringe. The former actor with the Midas touch tells us her recipe for a hit show‘We had wine. It was late.” Producer Francesca Moody shrugs as if that combination is where all genius lies. Six years ago, she and the director Vicky Jones read a single-page monologue by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. “Someone said we should take it to the Edinburgh fringe.” So began Moody’s journey with the skewer-tongued Fleabag, which brought the country – tipsy, horny and broken – to its knees.It received mixed reviews that year in Edinburgh but word of mouth spread like a super strain of gonorrhoea. It sold out, Waller-Bridge adapted it for TV and the stage version has triumphed on Broadway and become this summer’s hottest West End ticket. “I remember having a gut instinct that it was going to do brilliantly in Edinburgh,” Moody says, “but I don’t think any of us could have anticipated the success.” She smiles and does an elegant huff to camera, sorry, to me. “Frankly, it’s ridiculous.”We meet at Soho theatre. Sitting in her red jumpsuit from New York, with cropped blond hair, it’s easy to tell Moody trained as an actor good posture, well spoken. But she never wishes it was her on stage. “Absolutely not. Terrifying.” She laughs. “I was mediocre at best … This is the job I was meant to do.”Everything the 31-year-old Moody touches seems to turn to gongs. Last year at Edinburgh she won Fringe Firsts for Gary McNair and Kieran Hurley’s playground drama Square Go and Penelope Skinner’s Angry Alan, a flaying of modern masculine entitlement. This year she is returning with Square Go and bringing Baby Reindeer, by Edinburgh comedy award winner Richard Gadd, and Do Our Best, a comedy about grief and Girl Guides.Born in London, Moody studied drama at Exeter University and did a master’s in acting at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Producing happened by accident. A friend wanted to apply for funding from the now defunct IdeasTap, but wasn’t under 25. Moody, nowhere near the age restriction, took the lead. She worked part time front of house at the Royal Opera House (“pointing out where the loos were”) and produced on the side. Jones, a contemporary at Royal Welsh, asked if she’d help her and Waller-Bridge develop the repertoire of their company DryWrite from short-play nights to full-length plays. That led to Fleabag. She spent four years as a producer at Paines Plough, a year as executive producer for Curious Directive, then went freelance with Francesca Moody Productions.I thought producing was meant to be the most stressful job in theatre so throw Moody questions about coping with pressure. She answers as if confused by the idea that any of it is that difficult. Perhaps it’s a desire not to show fault, or maybe it’s the comfort of Soho, which “feels like home”. She’s produced many shows here including, this month, Gabriel Bisset-Smith’s Whitewash, about gentrification, housing and the decline of clubbing in London.Even in the theatrical hellscape of Edinburgh, Moody is not easily flustered. “I went first when I was 17 and have been every year since, working in some capacity.” There’s a formula to it, she thinks. Step one: find the right play. “I need a visceral reaction.” She read Baby Reindeer on the train. “It pulled into the station and I had 10 pages to go. I just stayed on the train reading it. I couldn’t bear not finishing.” It’s based on a true story about harassment and obsession. “Like all good thrillers, it keeps you guessing.”Step two: find the right venue. For Square Go in New York, they went with subscriber-based 59E59. The show was risky because “it’s just very Scottish” but they got the audience to chant and cheer. “Americans love to do that.” At the fringe, it is returning to Roundabout in Summerhall the in-the-round theatre ideal for the boxing-ring setting. For debuts, size is key. Do Our Best is by Remy Beasley. “Like Phoebe, she’s one of those people you just gravitate towards. She’s an amazing storyteller, naturally funny, not afraid to be ugly on stage.” It is at Ironbelly, a similar venue to where Fleabag was. “Somewhere like Roundabout is too exposing for a first time. But 60 seats?” She nods. “You’re not gonna make money, but you are gonna make reputations.”Is it really that simple? “There have been some hairy moments,” she admits. “I’ve had to deal with difficult personalities and make unpopular decisions. When things go wrong, ultimately it ends with you,” she hesitates, “even if it’s not your fault. In those cases you need a thick skin.” The biggest risk is always financial targets. “Edinburgh can be a real slog when you’re not getting audiences. You’d be hard pressed to find a producer who doesn’t wake up occasionally in hot sweats wondering how they’re going to get that last bit of money for the show.”But she never lets this stress spill out. “It’s a huge skill to not burden the rest of the creative team with the worries that go with the financial side,” says McNair. “She kept all that stuff away.” After years of trying to get Square Go picked up, Moody made it happen. “Some people thought it was too weird,” Hurley explains. “But she was just like, this is great, and we’re going to make it.”This time six years ago, Fleabag was still coming together. Last year, Square Go was getting its gloves fitted. “I’m one very small cog in the big Fleabag machine,” Moody insists, “but it’s amazing to know that something that started off as a tiny little show you made with your friends is suddenly in the West End.” Preparing for the fringe, she’s feeling hopeful – and not just for her own work. “The idea that an Edinburgh show could have that kind of success is more possible now Fleabag has made that journey.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e17103aacc4f28dbcc6e8cb44919cb8937825486/0_363_4404_2642/master/4404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f541741b4ca51a3d16121b73f136020","title":"jesus christ superstar review barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonTimothy Sheader brings his Regent’s Park rock concert indoors for a show that celebrates lung power over tendernessAh, the exuberance of youth! Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice initially released Jesus Christ Superstar as a rock-opera concept album, and the score has a maniacal energy and restless range you can almost hear the composer and lyricist reaching for their voice. When the show premiered on Broadway in 1971 it received mixed reviews, and the lingering suspicion emerged that this is a musical to be heard and not seen. Then came Timothy Sheader’s gold-rimmed rock concert at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in 2016 and the critics were silenced. But something about this Barbican transfer feels both hemmed in and overpowering, as if a big beast of an outdoor show has been trapped indoors.Tom Scutt’s sculptural scaffolding set has a balcony for the band, a giant fallen crucifix in the centre and trees poking out at the back. It is a reminder of the sheer scale this production once revelled in, which simply cannot be matched indoors. When the band plays, we’re hit with a wall of sound. It’s exhilarating at points but problematic. While the story of Jesus’s final days isn’t complicated, it is very hard to make out when the lyrics are this compromised.The relationship between Judas (Ricardo Afonso) and Jesus (Robert Tripolino) never quite gels and both singers push their performances too hard. Their lung capacity is admirable, but where is the tenderness? Matt Cardle, of X Factor fame, delivers Pilate’s dream song with aching regret. Mary Magdalene’s big number, I Don’t Know How to Love Him, can sound sappy but Sallay Garnett’s mellow soulfulness writes the score anew.In a bold and shiny show, Herod’s oceanic sweep of a gold cloak speaks of the awful excess of those in power and Drew McOnie’s canny choreography captures the frightening volatility of the mob. The chorus clamber for Jesus in one move and retreat the next. After he’s been crucified, they lean towards the fallen crucifix, reaching out for a leader they have vanquished."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1954c53914f3703bf6fd19f67e51857aa9aab08b/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc4e66f76df2a0d113a5ec8e53d04df4","title":"uk best seaside events attractions summer 2019 festivals art food","story":"Arts, watersports, concerts, outdoor cinema, food festivals and bucketloads of family fun … Here’s our pick of events on or near the UK’s beaches this summerBoardmasters (from £69 day ticket£179 five-day camping ticket, 7-11 August) is a surfing and music festival in Newquay, Cornwall.

It had bleached white because of the rising temperatures and the increasing acidity of the sea,” he said.Attenborough said radical action was needed to tackle the climate emergency – “we cannot be radical enough” – but also called for pragmatism in working out what was possible and how best to convince the public of the need for change.He said he did not think opposing voices should be suppressed. “It’s very, very important that voices of dissent should have a place where they’re heard and the arguments between the two sides can be worked out in public, and compared and analysed in public,” he said.He found reason for optimism among young people who were “already making themselves and their voices very, very clear”.“I’m OK, and all of us here are OK, because we don’t face the problems that are coming. But the problems in the next 30 years are really major problems that are going to cause social unrest, and great changes in the way that we live and what we eat. It’s going to happen.”Attenborough recently presented a primetime BBC documentary, Climate Change – The Facts, which was watched live by almost 3 million people in the UK. It is yet to be shown in Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27610f22d18902a129af83a974cbefd9db47af11/0_168_5034_3020/master/5034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd83fed6cf398ca36737e48a3b28e1e","title":"angela merkel seen shaking for third time","story":"German chancellor began trembling at reception for Finnish prime ministerAngela Merkel has insisted she is in good health after experiencing a third bout of shaking in as many weeks at a public event in Berlin.The German chancellor was seen trembling during military honours for Finland’s prime minister, Antti Rinne, in the forecourt of her chancellery on Wednesday morning.The bout of shaking was said to be less intense than in the previous two instances, and stopped when Merkel moved her body.“I am doing fine and you should not worry,” she said in a press conference after the meeting, adding that she was going through a phase of psychologically “processing” her first shaking episode last month.Merkel’s public bouts of shaking have fuelled speculation about her health. On 18 June, she was seen involuntarily shaking during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. She later appeared to blame dehydration, saying she felt better after drinking some water.She was seen going through a similar bout just a week later, during an appointment with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at Bellevue Palace in Berlin.Citing sources in government circles, the newspaper Stuttgarter Nachrichten said at the time that Merkel’s trembling had been triggered by the memory of the previous shaking bout, calling it a “psychological process”.“I have already said that I am going through a phase of processing the recent military honours with President Zelenskiy,” the chancellor said on Wednesday. “This appears not to be quite finished yet, but I am making progress and will have to live with it for a while.”She was also seen shaking during military honours in humid conditions in Mexico City on a visit in 2017.The 64-year-old’s work ethic and stamina during late-night negotiations has become the stuff of legend since she became chancellor in 2005. She once prided herself on having a “camel-like” capacity to store up sleep.Partially as a result of this reputation, the three televised moments of weakness have fuelled speculation about whether her intense schedule is beginning to take its toll.While coverage of the first shaking bout in German media was initially restrained, newspaper columns have since been filled with medical experts speculating about the cause.The German Green party co-leader Annalena Baerbock had suggested Merkel’s shaking episodes could be connected to the climate crisis, saying at a press conference that “regarding the hot temperatures, we can see from the chancellor it is clear that this summer climate has health consequences”. She later apologised for her comments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c654f7f543dee45caa83a988847409ca87dc357/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8cb1019ae0ef675bb72b184fcf9db5a","title":"bishop take skies exorcise colombian city helicopter buenaventura","story":"Army to provide helicopter for sprinkling of holy water on area beset by violent crimeA Colombian bishop is planning to exorcise an entire city this weekend, sprinkling holy water from a helicopter.Monsignor Rubén Darío Jaramillo Montoya, the bishop of Buenaventura, will say a prayer intended to purge the area of demonic infestation.The city is beset by violence, drug smuggling and poverty. Montoya disclosed the exorcism shortly after a 10-year-old girl was tortured and murdered.He told local radio: “We have to drive the devil out of Buenaventura, to see if we can restore the peace and tranquility that our city has lost due to so many crimes, acts of corruption and with so much evil and drug trafficking that invades our port.“We want to go around the whole of Buenaventura, from the air, and pour holy water on to it to see if we exorcise and get out all those demons that are destroying our port, so that God’s blessing comes and gets rid of all the wickedness that is in our streets.”Colombia’s army is reported to be providing the bishop with a helicopter for the aerial exorcism during the city’s annual patron saints’ festivities.Buenaventura, on Colombia’s Pacific coast, was named as the country’s most violent place in 2014. According to Human Rights Watch, “many of the city’s neighbourhoods are dominated by powerful criminal groups that commit widespread abuses, including abducting and dismembering people, sometimes while still alive, then dumping them in the sea. The groups maintain ‘chop-up houses’ (casas de pique) where they slaughter victims, according to witnesses, residents, the local Catholic church and some officials.”Since then, a marked improvement has been seen in some neighbourhoods after residents took action to regain control. But local media reported 51 homicides in the city in the first five months of this year, 20 more than the same period last year.Although exorcisms are usually carried out on iniduals, in 1890 Pope Leo XIII added a prayer, Exorcism against Satan and the Fallen Angels, for resolving demonic infestation.Last year, the Vatican held an exorcism training course for priests amid claims that demands for deliverance from demonic possession had greatly increased across the world.The Vatican-backed International Association of Exorcists, which represents more than 200 Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox priests, said the increase represented a “pastoral emergency”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c2a21e3d6286a199e096aec3a3f88183e625134/0_24_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a85ed7f43fa6784338d4d8ecbecd3072","title":"iran enrichment breach to go on until nuclear deal rights achieved","story":"Tehran meets French envoy as Rouhani warns UK of repercussions over oil tanker seizureIran has told Europe it will not reverse its decision to increase uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear accord until it achieves its “full rights” under the deal.Ali Shamkhani, a senior security official and representative of Iran’s supreme leader, made his remarks as he met a senior French diplomat sent to Tehran by the French president, Emmanuel Macron.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, also warned the UK it would face as yet unspecified consequences as result of the UK’s seizure of an oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship remains in British possession.Shamkhani’s warning suggests the three European powers – France, Germany and the UK – face an uphill struggle to keep the nuclear deal alive. Shamkhani said the Iranian strategy was unchangeable, and claimed European countries had shown a lack of will to keep their side of the bargain.The two-day visit by the French envoy to Tehran, Emmanuel Bonne, was seen as probably the last attempt to broker a deal before Europe decided to put Iran’s actions into the formal dispute mechanism of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).If the dispute mechanism is unable to resolve the differences, it is likely the EU will restore sanctions against Iran that were taken off when the deal was first signed.Iran argues that it is no longer bound by the cap because of the withdrawal of the US from the agreement, and the reimposition of economic sanctions Donald Trump.Read more: Iran\u0027s uranium enrichment programme: the science explainedTehran has been demanding that the EU do more to compensate Iran for Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal last year, a withdrawal followed by a US attempt to impose maximum economic pressure on Tehran, including a worldwide ban on the purchase of Iranian oil exports.Semkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), told Bonne on Wednesday that Tehran regarded Iran’s action as within the terms of the JCPOA because the country was entitled to downgrade its commitments if the other side failed to meet their own.Iran has been frustrated by the slow European progress in setting up a long-planned financial mechanism designed to circumvent the impact of US secondary sanctions on firms that seek to trade with Iran.The EU says the slow progress is due to technical and legal difficulties, and not an absence of political will, but Tehran has been losing faith. According to the secretariat of the SNSC, Emanuel Ban, a diplomatic advisor to the Iranian president, will meet with Shamkhani on Wednesday. The mechanisms for fulfilling the commitments of the EU countries have been discussed with him in regional and bilateral issues.Shamkhani insisted Iran would resist US pressure, saying: “Iran has in practice proved that in economic, political and defence dimensions it has the ability and capacity to manage and deal with various tensions and challenges. You can not speak the language of force.”He said Europe should have allowed the US to take it hostage, and instead showed its independence from the US.Bonne said: “I have not come to Iran as a mediator and do not carry any message from the US to Tehran. Given Iran’s undeniable role and influence in the region, Paris is interested in continuing dialogue and cooperation with Iran to manage current crises in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.”Last week, UK authorities in Gibraltar intercepted an Iranian supertanker that was believed to be breaching EU sanctions by carrying a shipment of Tehran’s crude oil to war-ravaged Syria. Royal Marines helped seize the tanker, together with Gibraltar police.Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency on Wednesday as calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship as “mean and wrong”. During a cabinet meeting he warned London: “You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b834e6d0c6ef3137736930742cafef8848d12ffe/0_33_5138_3083/master/5138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67d56099b9bdb57e5d37f0b286ce8ba0","title":"unesco world heritage us frank lloyd wright modern","story":"A group of eight projects by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright are now included on the list of 1,000 heritage sites around the worldA villa in Los Angeles and a church near Chicago have been granted the same level of cultural recognition as the pyramids of Giza and the Great Barrier Reef, and have been declared Unesco World Heritage sites.They are part of a group of eight projects by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright to be added to the list of 1,000 heritage sites around the world. The Wright structures are the only US modern architecture on the prestigious list.Hollyhock House, for instance, sits in the middle of a park in east Hollywood, and at first it occasioned great displeasure. Designed by Wright as a residence for the oil heiress Aline Barnsdall, and built from 1919–1921, it was envisaged as part of a larger art and theater complex, but that project never materialized. Wright was fired from the site in 1921 for cost overruns.The heiress, frustrated with the expense of maintaining it, donated the house to the city of Los Angeles in 1927. Arranged around a central courtyard, its many terraces and split levels frame what was intended to be a stage. Wright used evocative Mayan and hollyhock floral motifs, with symmetrical decorations dotting the outside.Born in 1867, Wright is considered America’s greatest 20th-century architect. He designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed. Wright’s philosophy was that architecture should be organic, and in his hands structures and their surroundings interacted harmoniously. Often, they had an open-format plan, with a blurring of boundaries between interior and exterior spaces. In addition to houses, he designed dozens of schools, churches, skyscrapers, hotels and museums, often crafting the interior elements for the buildings as well.The sites selected as part of “The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright” include Unity Temple (1909, Oak Park, Illinois), the Frederick C Robie House (1910, Chicago), Taliesin (1911, Spring Green, Wisconsin), the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs House (1937, Madison, Wisconsin), Taliesin West (1938, Scottsdale, Arizona) Fallingwater (1939, Pennsylvania) and the Solomon R Guggenheim Museum (1959, New York).In Wright’s time, American cultural leaders revered the European modernists over homegrown practitioners, even though the work of many Europeans was heavily influenced by Wright, said Stuart Graff, the president and CEO of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation.“Wright’s architecture reflects his efforts to put vital American values like liberty, democracy and community into material expression,” he said.“We look at some of his best known works and see the grandness of his designs.” But “much of Wright’s work was always about establishing a democratic architecture in which quality and beauty were available to all, and that’s a still a part of his vision that we should work to realize in our time.”The Unesco designation means these sites may now enjoy better funding and, in turn, preservation.Hollyhock House has gone through multiple renovations, the most recent in 2014. When the building reopened to the public, the doors were kept open for 24 hours straight, and the Los Angeles Times estimated that a thousand people at a time lined up to get a chance to enter."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3819052.1552049214!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"online shopping after brexit higher prices slower deliveries","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit bill: something that costs €50 to buy and have sent from an Amazon warehouse today could jump to more than €65 once third-country charges are totted up. Photograph: Oli ScarffGettyRocketing prices, customs hold-ups, delivery delays, obstacles to returning unwanted purchases and a dramatic curtailment in the retail choices and rights available to Irish consumers are just some of the problems online shoppers here may be hit with if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal in three weeks’ time.Much of the Brexit debate in Dublin, London, Brussels and other European capitals has focused on if and how a physically hard border on the island of Ireland can be avoided when the United Kingdom\u0026nbspsays its goodbyes.But the virtual, online border is likely be one of the earliest signs of what a hard Brexit will look like. It is not going to be pretty. The biggest shock for Irish consumers is likely to be price spikes. Something that costs €500 on a UK-based website today could jump to more than €650\u0026nbsponce new taxes and charges are totted up.“To be honest, we still haven’t a clue what is going to happen,” says one senior source at one of the biggest online retailers in the UK. “I don’t think anybody does. So for now what we are doing is what we have been doing since the vote in June 2016. We are keeping our fingers crossed.”“There is going to be a lot of confusion,” says PwC’s director of retail and consumer practice Owen McFeely. “And there are going to be a lot of consumers who won’t understand what is happening when they get a demand for duty and VAT before their goods are released.”Amazon – the largest player in the online marketplace in the UK – did not respond to this newspaper’s queries about its post-Brexit plans, but it did write to thousands of UK-based sellers that use its platform earlier this year warning them that a no-deal “may temporarily prevent cross-border trade” with Ireland and every other EU country.The letter asked them to send at least four weeks’ worth of stock to European “fulfilment centres” – the giant warehouses it has dotted around the Continent\u0026nbsp– so at the very least the site can continue trading as normal in the short term.What might happen in the slightly longer term is anyone’s guess but, unless a no-deal Brexit can be avoided as the endgame reaches its climax next week, Irish consumers will quickly feel the pain.Few countries have benefited more from the explosion in online shopping than Ireland it has given consumers here access to a much wider array of products at sometimes much lower prices.According to Paypal, Ireland is in the top three countries in the developed world for online shopping, which is worth €5 billion here. As much as 70 per cent of the spending goes abroad, with a huge percentage ending up in the pockets of UK retailers. An Post alone delivers about 14 million parcels from there to here each year.While uncertainty about what happens next is everywhere, the dangers of a chaotic departure have been flagged for a long time. Not long after British voters decided by a slender majority that they wanted out of the EU, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Niall Cody, told an Oireachtas committee that the decision would have such an impact on online shopping from the UK that “the model will not make sense”.He warned that in a hard Brexit scenario – which back in the summer of 2017 still seemed unlikely – an Irish shopper buying from a UK-based business would be treated “exactly the same as if he or she were buying from a US-based business”.Would that be so bad? The simple answer is yes. As it stands, Irish people who shop with UK-based websites generally pay UK VAT and other taxes and only pay extra for delivery. (Some sites charge Irish taxes to Irish shoppers, but the rates are similar.) But once the UK leaves the EU, hefty import duties and additional VAT will suddenly apply. How much extra will depend on what the products are and their value. A dress with a UK price tag of €200 will climb in price for shoppers in the Republic to €270 when VAT of 23 per cent and duty of 12 per cent are added, while a laptop with a UK price of €1,000 will suddenly cost €1,230 with the addition of VAT.“In simple terms what a no-deal Brexit will mean is that the UK will suddenly become a third country,” says John O’Loughlin, a customs and trade expert with PwC. Effectively, it will be regarded as being no different in trade terms from China,\u0026nbspSouth Africa or the United States, “and that is going to have significant tax implications”, he warns.O’Loughlin says many of the more sophisticated retailers in the UK will operate on a “DDP” – delivered duty paid, which means the price paid at checkout is the final price and will include all taxes – but others will leave it to delivery companies here to collect the outstanding taxes before they hand over the goods.“People will think they are buying something for €1,000, but when it arrives at their home it will actually have cost them €1,230,” O’Loughlin says, “and that will almost immediately create a huge amount of customer dissatisfaction in this country.”Gerard O’Neill, chairman of the research company Amárach, says: “The best-case scenario – and it is not a particularly good case – is everything will just get kicked further down the road and we will get a delay in the apocalypse of six or nine months. But if we don’t, and if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, then from March 30th what we will see are much longer delivery times and hefty tariffs attached to products.”O’Neill says that the “flip side is we are likely to see sterling collapsing even more”, which might make products bought from UK-based websites cheaper – as long as the taxes are not attached to them.O’Neill advises against people buying products online from the UK and hoping they don’t get stopped by Revenue. The tax authorities “in\u0026nbspthis country and across the EU will be extremely sensitive to products originating from the likes of amazon, because the authorities here and across Europe won’t want to see their retailers being undercut by UK retailers as a result of currency devaluations”.Revenue says it has been “actively engaged” in preparing for all potential Brexit scenarios, including no deal, and if that happens then long-established rules for buying goods from outside the EU will kick in.An Post is also getting ready for the upheaval. “We have been planning for the possible exit of the UK from the EU for two years, and we have a comprehensive Brexit action plan in place,” its spokeswoman Anna McHugh says.It has, she adds, been “liaising with the relevant authorities in Ireland, Britain and the EU, including the Government, customs authorities, other logistics companies and industry groups, to make sure we are prepared to deal with whatever type of Brexit comes to pass”.An Post handles more than 10 million parcels every year from non-EU countries, all of which are made available to customs agents for inspection. “In the event of a hard Brexit, the 14 million parcels we receive annually from the UK will simply join this stream of incoming parcels being presented to customs.”Once the Brexit outlook “is more certain, we’ll provide an online information and advice hub for personal and business customers. And our post offices will advise on any additional labelling which may be required on items being posted to the UK, as is currently the case for parcels going to the United States. ”It is not, perhaps, all bad news. The collapse of sterling might offset some of the tax changes, while there could be more opportunities for Irish retailers with effective ecommerce operations to grow, O’Neill says.“What they will be able to say is, if you want your product tomorrow then don’t shop at Amazon or Asos – shop with us. It could lead to some Irish retailers getting a market-share growth, at least in the short term.”McFeely agrees and suggests there “is a huge opportunity for Irish retailers who are in the online space. They will have shorter supply lines\u0026nbspand will be able to promise Irish consumers next-day delivery, and they won’t have to contend with the same tax implications as sellers based in the UK.”The Donegal tweed brand Magee 1866 is one Irish retailer that has exploited the potential for ecommerce, and used its digital channels to significantly grow its business online sales now generate one-fifth of its revenue. Its online sales are growing at 80 per cent a year, and it sells to more than 60 countries – with the UK its biggest overseas market by some margin.“There are just so many unanswered questions, and right now we are just a couple of weeks away from the deadline and we are still not even close to having any kind of certainty as to what might happen next,” says the company’s head of digital,\u0026nbspDominic Tracey.While Magee has some plans in place to handle a no-deal Brexit in the short term, there is only so much that can be achieved by switching stock from warehouses in one jurisdiction to the other. He says the UK leaving with no deal “would be a disaster” for both jurisdictions and hopes Brexit may still be avoided failing that, “the best-case scenario would be for a delay, to allow everything to be aligned”.Higher prices, delivery delays and availability are not the only clouds on the horizon. Once the UK leaves the EU, the guaranteed protections consumers have when shopping on sites based there may disappear. Under EU legislation, consumers have a 14-day cooling-off period during which they can return goods for any reason. They also have the right to a refund for delays or nondelivery, as well as the right to redress in case of faulty goods. But if the UK is no longer covered by EU law, then the existing rules will no longer apply.McFeely points out that while UK retailers will no longer be subject to EU law and will not have to accept returns from Irish consumers if they choose not to, he can’t envisage a scenario where they will change their policies overnight.“If I look to April, I don’t see any impact in terms of choice or changed policies, but products will be hit with tariffs and taxes, and, in terms of supply chains, there will be longer delays and bottlenecks and a whole lot more customer dissatisfaction.”He says businesses that deal with the UK have, in recent days, grown slightly more hopeful that a catastrophe can be avoided. “We have seen more optimism in the last week, and if this coming week the British government’s Brexit deal gets voted down then we might see an extension of article 50, and an extension – even a short-term extension – is better than a crash-out, because businesses are just not ready for Brexit yet.”O’Neill puts it even more bluntly. “There is a real danger we are either sleepwalking to the edge of the abyss, and not paying attention to what is happening, or we are telling ourselves that what have here is a Y2K situation and that it will be an all-right-on-the-night type of optimism. But it won’t be all right on the night. We are in a lose-lose-lose situation, and there will be no winners.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe family of murdered prison officer Brian Stack has received an apology from Garda Commissioner Drew Harris on behalf of the force for the “failings and shortcomings” in its investigation.Mr Stack, who was shot outside the National Stadium, Dublin, in 1983 by the IRA and died 18 months later, was the chief officer at Portlaoise prison at the time of his death. In a statement issued after a 90 minute meeting with Mr Stack’s family on Wednesday, Mr Harris admitted the Garda’s mistakes had impacted on the investigation.“Along with senior detectives, I met with the Stack family this morning to provide them with a briefing on the ongoing investigation into the murder of Mr Brian Stack,” said Mr Drew.“I offered the Stack family an apology for the failings and shortcomings in the investigation. I fully acknowledge that these matters are serious and had a detrimental impact on the investigation.Separately, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the murder of Mr Stack was “one of the most horrendous atrocities” of the Troubles. “I certainly hope every effort will continue to be made to bring those responsible to justice,” he added.Before the meeting at Garda Headquarters, Mr Stack’s son Austin said the family wanted answers about key material evidence and fingerprints that went missing.He also claimed eyewitnesses were not interviewed, and that critical intelligence was passed to gardaí in 1990 but that it was not acted upon and was instead “suppressed”. Mr Stack alleged that three separate Garda investigations have been carried out in an “uncooperative, disingenuous and disgraceful manner”. The Stack family are seeking a copy of the Serious Crime Review team report, he said.Family reactionMr Stack’s son, Austin Stack, speaking after the meeting at Garda Headquarters in Dublin, said the apology from Mr Drew was “significant” and that the family was grateful.However, he suggested there had been an element of “conspiracy” within the force and said he would be appealing to Mr Flanagan to appoint an independent policing expert to carry out a review of the case.“We had a very full and frank discussion with the commissioner,” he said. “The family outlined a lot of the concerns we’ve had in relation to the errors. We outlined what we felt were the critical errors.“The commissioner has given us a verbal apology for those errors and the handling of the investigation. “From our perspective, we will be asking the Minister for Justice to consider asking an independent policing expert from outside the State to carry out a review of the investigation into my father’s murder.Claims“Tangible exhibits went missing. The commissioner was not able to explain that. He wasn’t able to explain why eyewitnesses were not interviewed. “We want an independent person to look at this. From our perspective there was critical intelligence held within the walls of Garda Headquarters and it wasn’t passed on to the serious crime review team.“There may have been an element initially of shoddy police work. But I also think there was some element of conspiracy in relation to iniduals who should have been interviewed at the time but were not.“I do believe there is more behind the scenes on this. I believe there are things that went on in Portlaoise Prison at the time that need to be explored more in terms of people who were collaborating with the IRA.”Mr Stack was also critical of Gerry Adams, whom he said had more information on the murder than he has so far disclosed.“Gerry Adams was interviewed recently but I believe it was very much a choreographed interview from what the investigation team has told me,” he said. “Gerry Adams has a lot of knowledge around this that he has not brought to the table.“Gerry Adams described the IRA man that we met as a friend. This inidual told us he met with the iniduals who carried out the attack so there is a clear, direct link from Gerry Adams back to the iniduals who carried out this attack.”A file has been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to Mr Stack’s murder but the Garda has not issued any recommendation in relation to whether a prosecution should be brought. Mr Stack said he did not expect the DPP to prosecute."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3951738.1562695390!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we are not going to be bribed out of the united kingdom orange order chief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Orange Order grand secretary Mervyn Gibson, at the Museum of Orange Heritage,  Belfast. Photograph: Liam McBurney A stack of leaflets in the reception of the Museum of Orange Heritage in south Belfast shows a cartoon of golf club wielding Orangemen marching on to a putting green. “Where’s the 12th this year? Enjoy the Orange . . . and the greens,” the leaflet reads, suggesting a visit to watch one of 18 Orange parades to tourists arriving early for next week’s British Open at Portrush. It is the first time one of golf’s “majors” has been played in Northern Ireland in 68 years. Rev Mervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, says the parades on July 12th, the biggest date in the unionist calendar, attract what the tourist trade calls the “culturally curious”. “They see a parade with colourful bands and banners, and music. To them, it is another Mardi Gras,” he tells The  as the Orange Order prepares for the Twelfth.Sitting in Schomberg House’s Aughrim boardroom – named after King William III’s bloodier 17th-century victory in Co Galway – the Orangeman reflects on inclusion, and exclusion, as the debate rages around Brexit, stirring issues of political identity and nationality in Northern Ireland. He says he has not read The  weekend interview with James Nesbitt but is interested in it given what he hears of the desire of the Northern Irish actor – a Protestant who sees himself as “an Irishman from the north of Ireland” – for “a new union of Ireland”.Rev Gibson says unionists “when they become famous” sometimes move away from unionism because it is viewed as being “on the wrong side of history” when “republicanism has all the romanticism”. “People associate with that as opposed to what is viewed, wrongly in my opinion, as a bigoted and sectarian culture,” he says.This Orangeman sees himself as British but “proud to be from Northern Ireland” yet with an “all-Ireland dimension” given that his father and grandfather came from Co Donegal. ‘Project fear’Rev Gibson does not see any risk to the North’s place in the United Kingdom from Brexit and does not believe Northern Irish Protestant unionists have anything to fear. Talk of a united Ireland as a fallout from the UK’s departure from the EU is a “scare tactic,” he says, while warnings of a no-deal Brexit leading to a Border poll on Irish unification is part of “project fear” or people “playing politics with it”.He describes last year’s visit of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to the Orange museum, becoming the first serving Irish head of government to visit the Orange Order’s HQ, as “pivotal in changing and improving relationships”.Asked about Tánaiste Simon Coveney this week describing the risk of a no-deal Brexit never being higher, the Orangeman, who voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, says he has “nothing to fear from politics”.A Border poll on Irish unification may indeed come but Rev Gibson “just doesn’t see the need for it right away”. Neither does he believe that a united Ireland is inevitable. “What will come will come but I am not a doom-gloom merchant, saying it is around the corner,” he says.He argues that the “three Bs” – as Rev Gibson calls “Brexit, the backstop and Border polls” – are being used “to unsettle the constitutional question” and to “create apathy among British people”.“The only thing that will take us into a united Ireland is a vote of the majority of the people. As a democrat, I’ll accept that. I’m not going to go to war over it,” he says. He believes “backstops will come and go” but little will change as a consequence of Brexit or negotiations.“We will survive as a British people here in Northern Ireland. We have faced a lot bigger challenges than that,” he says.“We couldn’t be bombed or bullied out of the United Kingdom. We are not going to be bribed out of it now either.” Rev Gibson questions how some unionists such as Ulster farmers opposed to Brexit for economic reasons could favour a united Ireland. “One wonders that if someone can change their allegiance for purely economic reasons, what was their allegiance in the first place?” he asks.Irish passportsSaying that, he understands how Ulster unionists can apply for an Irish passport for economic or pragmatic reasons if it makes travelling on holiday to Europe or to their Spanish holiday homes easier. As a Presbyterian clergyman, he regularly signs Irish passport application forms for unionists and loyalists, he says. “It surprises me but I don’t think it diminishes a person’s Britishness. They are not signing them to be Irish they are signing them for European citizenship, for the benefits of living or working in Europe,” he says.This year’s Twelfth celebrations have drawn controversy over large bonfires set to be lit on the eve of the Orange parades across Northern Ireland commemorating the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Bonfire builders voluntarily removed tyres because of the risk from fumes but Belfast City Council insisted on material being removed from one large bonfire on the grounds of the Avoniel Leisure Centre in east Belfast. Rev Gibson has warned that further action could be seen by the community as an “attack on their culture”.He sees this year being no different because of Brexit. There will “political messages” on the day around support for remaining in the UK, for implementing Brexit and for the security services such as “Soldier F”, the former British soldier facing murder charges over killings on Bloody Sunday in Derry in 1972. Parachute Regiment flags have appeared next to Union Jacks and Ulster Banners on posts around Belfast and other parts of Northern Ireland. “We’re not majoring on those things. We don’t walk to protest in many instances. We walk to celebrate,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3951736.1562695369!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit no deal the five key questions you need answered","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government estimates  a no-deal Brexit could cost the exchequer more than €6 billion next year. Photograph: iStockWhy is there another no-deal Brexit plan from the Government ?The Government has already published a number of plans for a no-deal Brexit, notably in the run-up to the last deadline in April. However, the message is that more time has allowed for more preparations, for example at the country’s ports, to tie down the reciprocal rights of Irish and UK citizens and to put in place aid programmes for businesses. Tuesday’s no-deal update is gloomy, warning that there is an increased chance of such an outcome and that it would be “highly disruptive” and have “profound economic and legal implications.”Why is the Government doing this?What was said today on the Border?Not a huge amount, but what was said was significant. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Government has indicated that it will try to achieve two goals – avoiding a hard Border and retaining full Irish membership of the EU single market. This is difficult because once the UK leaves the EU, checks on some goods will have to be conducted as they enter the EU market.Today’s document says that to maintain Ireland’s full participation in the EU single market, checks in relation to tariffs, customs and food and animal safety on goods entering from the North will need to be conducted – and that these would be significant and disruptive. This is an important signal and a clear sign that Ireland will not compromise its membership of the EU single market, even if it means some checks on cross-border goods movements. But there is no detail on where and how these checks would happen. When discussing Brexit with Irish ministers and officials it remains a case of “don’t mention the Border.”In relation to customs and tariffs, checks may be possible at company premises as goods leave and arrive, though some spot checks will also be necessary as products move .However, it is in the area of animal and food safety checks that the greatest difficulty emerges, with EU rules stating these must be conducted on entry to the EU. The Government has indicated it recognises the checks are necessary – Tánaiste Simon Coveney said we will have to take “some action, somewhere” – but is continuing to talk to the European Commission about how and where this will happen and remains opposed to any infrastructure at or near the Border. How to square this circle will be a vital issue in the weeks ahead – and there is no certainty here for businesses trying to plan.What is it all going to cost ?We have already heard in the pre-budget report last week that this is a huge economic issue too, pushing the budget into deficit and threatening as many as 55,000 jobs. An organised Brexit under the withdrawal agreement would mean a gradual but significant hit to growth and jobs over a period of years. A no-deal Brexit would increase the cost and move a lot of the pain into a shorter period, starting at the end of October, if that is when it occurs. Significant and immediate threats would face some key sectors, notably large parts of the food trade which would face the threat of tariffs – damaging import taxes – which could price much of their product out of the UK marketplace. Some special funds are already in place to help businesses, but we now learn that the EU competition directorate has a special task force in place which will examine requests for assistance for companies hit on a case-by-case basis. Much of the cash would come from the Irish exchequer, of course.The Government has already estimated that a no-deal Brexit could cost the exchequer more than €6 billion in total next year, leading to a deficit of between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent of GDP.Do you shop online UK sites? In future you will have to pay VAT on arrival – as happens now with non-EU sites. Returning products to the online retailer will get a lot more complicated, requiring proof that you re-exported the goods to get your tax back. Supply of retail goods into the Irish market is being discussed by industry players and governments but will face challenges, and some UK products may disappear from our shelves. In aviation much remains to be sorted out, including EU clearance of ownership structures of airlines operating here. To drive in the UK, including the North, you will need either a green card or proof of insurance. And on it goes. The key thing about Brexit is that it crosses so many areas.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsThe Government has signalled for the first time that checks on some goods imported from the North will be necessary after a no-deal Brexit, though Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney insisted that there would no checks “on the Border or close to it”.Publishing a document on Tuesday that laid bare the extent of the economic and political threats of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Coveney said some checks on goods would be necessary in order to maintain Ireland’s place in the EU’s single market.The Government has underlined its commitment not to reinstate a hard border, but Mr Coveney conceded that to remain fully inside the EU trading bloc Ireland would have to take “some action, somewhere” to ensure EU rules and regulations were met on goods entering from the North.He declined to say where the checks on goods would be but promised that there would be no infrastructure on the Border. Discussions are ongoing with the European Commission, he said, about how to protect the single market, while at the same time maintaining an open border in Ireland.Mr Coveney said the talks would focus on protecting the single market in a way “that limits the disruption of that and the costs of that for business” while also reassuring the EU about the standards of goods leaving the island of Ireland.Position shift The publication of the document, and Mr Coveney’s comments afterwards, mark a shift in the Government’s public position on the issue of checks on goods, admitting for the first time that some checks may be necessary.The shift demonstrates the extent to which expectations about Brexit in Dublin and Brussels have become more pessimistic in recent months, in part due to the Conservative leadership contest in the UK. Both candidates for the party leadership and the prime minister’s office have said they will leave the EU without a deal on October 31th if the EU does not agree to changes to the backstop in the withdrawal agreement.Both the EU and the Government have said there will be no change to the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, but have signalled they are willing to change the political declaration which charts the direction of the future trading relationship.Bleak viewThe latest no-deal Brexit update outlines the bleakest view yet of the political and economic consequences, which it warns will be “highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications”.It outlines plans to try to keep trade flowing through the country’s ports, despite the need for new checks on trucks arriving from the UK. Trucks will not be allowed to board ferries coming to Ireland unless they have the requisite customs clearance and those with animal and food shipments will have to give at least 24 hours’ notice.While officials are confident that trucks will flow relatively freely on arrival in Ireland, some will have to be checked and the document gives strong warnings of likely delays in goods transported between Ireland and the Continent via the UK – the so-called landbridge – which carries €21 billion worth of Irish trade each year. This is likely to be subject to “severe delays and disruption”, it warns. New sea routes are being opened direct to the Continent, but the landbridge will remain vital.The document also said that 50,000-55,000 jobs could be at risk and that a no-deal Brexit would swing exchequer finances into deficit for 2020.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins The Brexit planning document published by the Government on Tuesday is reminiscent of the warnings about the Irish economy and housing market that proliferated in the first phase of the economic crash a decade ago.It is one of the most alarming documents ever published by an Irish government.It warns of “profound implications for Ireland on all levels” elaborating that they involve “severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges both in the immediate term and in the longer term”.It warns darkly of “difficult and significant choices of a practical, strategic and political nature”.And even though it puts the best gloss possible on the intensive preparations the civil service has been making for Brexit, it acknowledges that even so, there will be significant damage North and South if a no-deal Brexit occurs.“A no-deal Brexit will be highly disruptive and will have profound political, economic and legal implications, first and foremost for the UK, including most significantly Northern Ireland, as well as having significant impacts on Ireland and the rest of the EU,” it says. Written in low-key officialise, it is a sobering read.WarningsLater in the afternoon, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and the Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe elaborated on the warnings in the dry print of the official document.“The truth is we will need to take some action somewhere in our economy to ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the products that are then going to be sold on off Ireland,” Mr Coveney said.Translation: there may have to be checks on important imports from the North after all. But not, he insisted, on the Border. But somewhere else?Brexit game planYes. The publication of the document marked the extent to which reality is intruding on the Government’s Brexit game plan.If the British government has long promised two things which are, on the face of it, mutually exclusive – ie, leaving the single market and customs union while having no disruption to trade on the Border – the Irish Government has been guilty of something similar: promising to protect the single market while insisting there would be no Border checks.On Tuesday that position was refined in a subtle but important way: the Government admitted that there will have to be checks, but insists that it will not take place on the Border. But if not on the Border – then where? That is the question that now moves centre stage in the Government’s Brexit planning.Discussions continue with the European Commission on how to “protect the single market”. But it is clear that something important has shifted in that conversation.Full pictureThe previous assurances – how many times have you heard the Taoiseach or Tánaiste say “There will be no physical infrastructure or related checks or controls” – are no longer quite the full picture. The Government has relished wearing the green jersey on Brexit and standing up to the British with the help of the EU, and has been aware of the political benefits of doing so. But now the pitfalls begin to emerge from the fog.Varadkar and Coveney have often said there is no such thing as a good Brexit for Ireland. That may be true also for the Government. Government Ministers and officials are at pains to point out that this isn’t their fault the hardening of the British position has outflanked the careful compromises and delicate architecture of the withdrawal agreement and its backstop. And they’re right.The British, for their part, say that they won’t put up a border, no matter what. If the Irish and the EU want one, that’s their business. An emerging blame game is already in evidence.But there’s a danger that everyone spends the next two months trying to avoid the blame for a crash-out Brexit, rather than trying to avoid a crash-out Brexit.There’s another question that will surface too. Once the new British government takes office, the focus will shift to the backstop, which remains the biggest obstacle to the acceptance of the withdrawal agreement by the House of Commons.Intense pressureIf a concession on the backstop materialises – perhaps a time-limiting protocol a legal codicil which specifies a review in the absence of agreement something, anything to give the new prime minster an opportunity to bring the withdrawal agreement back to the House of Commons – then there will surely be intense pressure on the Irish Government to accept it.After all, isn’t the possibility of Border checks in a few year’s time better than the certainty of checks on October 31st? Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has previously insisted that this has to be settled now. But does it really? Varadkar may find he has to make the case for not kicking the can down the road. Politicians usually find themselves making the opposite argument.That is the next phase. After the summer interlude and the change of government in the UK, Brexit will become centre stage in Irish politics once again.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Tory leadership latest: Kim Darroch resigns following leak as he says it is \u0026#39impossible to carry on\u0026#39Prince Charles village traffic scheme at centre of complaints from blind campaignersJacinda Ardern\u0026#39s neighbour reveals he killed New Zealand\u0026#39s \u0026#39first cat\u0026#39 by reversing over itComment: Labour has just blown its last chance to crack the Brexit conundrumChristian doctor lost his job in government department after refusing to identify a six-foot-tall bearded man as ‘madam’, tribunal hearsCatalonia accuses Spain of spying on its UK mission as order revealed to \u0026#39get closer to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026#39European Commission president-elect warns Britain over \u0026#39tone and attitude\u0026#39 of BrexitMatteo Salvini\u0026#39s far-Right League \u0026#39sought millions in funding\u0026#39 from Russian investors  Sir John Major says he will personally take Boris Johnson to court if he suspends Parliament for a no deal BrexitBoris Johnson vs Jeremy Hunt: What do  readers make of the Tory leadership candidates’ policy pledges? The Kim Darroch row is a message to Theresa May\u0026#39s successor - Get Brexit right or face Donald Trump\u0026#39s wrathFrance admits it is owner of missiles found on Libyan rebel base used for Haftar\u0026#39s assault on TripoliSir Kim Darroch: How Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39self-important\u0026#39 ambassador became a man Brexiteers - and Trump - could not standAngela Merkel says she is \u0026#39very well\u0026#39 despite third shaking episodeAll the people Donald Trump claims he hasn\u0026#39t met - despite evidence to the contrary‘Hunt was the Chamberlain to Boris\u0026#39s Churchill’ -  readers on who won ITV’s Tory leadership debateRapper Nicki Minaj pulls out of controversial Saudi Arabia concert Midsomer Murders arrest as man in Romania held over claw hammer murder of Valerie Graves in 2013US plans to form military coalition to safeguard Gulf waters from Iran attacksJames Dyson buys Singapore\u0026#39s most expensive apartment \u0026#39for £44m\u0026#39 as he prepares to move company HQBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel seen shaking third time welcomes finnish pm","story":"Angela Merkel has insisted she is very well after she was seen shaking at a public occasion for the third time in recent weeks on Wednesday.The veteran Chancellor can be seen shaking at a ceremony to welcome the Finnish prime minister to Berlin in a short video clip circulating on social media.After shaking for a few seconds she gestures to Finnish leader Antti Rinne and then walks away without showing any signs of distress.Reuters has also reported that Mrs Merkel started to shake during the meeting in Berlin.Speaking to journalists afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: I feel very well, there is no need to worry. She added: I think me saying I am fine should be acceptable.Mrs Merkel held her arms during a shaking episode in Berlin last monthMrs Merkel has carried on with her scheduled appointments since the incident, and no official explanation has been offered.The German leader’s first shaking fit came on June 18 when she welcomed the Ukrainian president to Berlin.

The medic claims he was told he was “overwhelmingly likely” to lose his job unless he agreed. Dr Mackereth left his role on June 25, 2018, after an email exchange with Mr Owen in which he was instructed to follow the “process as discussed in your training”.The email read: “If however you do not want to do this, we will respect your decision and your right to leave your contract.” Dr Mackereth replied: “I am a Christian and in good conscience cannot do what the DWP is requiring of me.”He insists he did not resign his position and is the victim of direct discrimination and harassment. Dr David Mackereth, pictured outside the employment tribunal building in BirminghamDr Mackereth told the hearing: “The very fact a doctor can be pulled of the shop floor for an urgent interrogation about his beliefs on gender fluidity is both absurd and very sinister, even more so if it results in a dismissal. “If something like that happened in a church setting - people being pulled out of a pew, questioned, and then excommunicated - that would be seen as an outrageous example of religious intolerance and bigotry.”The DWP argues that Dr Mackereth’s views are in breach of the 2010 Equality Act. APM, the recruitment company who hired the medic, is also being sued for religious discrimination.The company claims that the doctor’s beliefs “are not compatible with human dignity”.In a statement put before the court, Dr Mackereth said: “I appreciate that in the present political climate, somepeople, including some of those who believe they are transgender, may find my beliefs to be offensive.“However, in a free society, this is not a good enough reason to censor my beliefs and coerce me to act contrary to my conscience.“Moreover, as a doctor, my responsibility is always to act in good conscience in the best interest of the patients - not to adopt various fancies, prejudices, or delusions, to avoid offence at all cost.”Dr Mackereth added that his inherent belief is that transgenderism is a “rebellion against God, which is both pointless and sinful”.He said: “I am, of course, aware that there are men or women who believe they have been trapped in a wrong body, and I do not question the sincerity of their convictions.“A small number of such people have always existed.  Up until recently, such a belief was considered by medics to be delusional and a symptom of a medical disorder.“It is only recently that transgenderism has been recognised as normal and such delusional beliefs accepted at face value.

Based on poor data from timelier business surveys, a number of economists think the economy contracted for the first time in seven years in the second quarter, and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics did not change that view.\u0026nbspThe May car production figures were flattered by a plunge in April when many plants had no choice but to go ahead with planned closures ahead of the previous Brexit deadline of\u0026nbsp29 March.\u0026nbspA longer-term and less-volatile measure of GDP showed that, in the three months to May, economic output rose 0.3 per cent compared with the three months ending in February. That marked\u0026nbspa deterioration from the first quarter when growth stood at 0.5 per cent.“Although there was a modest rally in GDP growth between April and May, the continued slowdown on the underlying three-month measure is further evidence that the UK economy is faltering under the weight of relentless Brexit uncertainty and tougher global economic conditions,” said\u0026nbspSuren\u0026nbspThiru, economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.“Manufacturing activity picked up in May as car production reopened, but the longer-term measures point to a sector under pressure from the running down of excess stock, tougher global trading conditions and rising upfront costs.”Created with Sketch.

There was better news on\u0026nbspthe much smaller construction sector where output increased by 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspafter previous falls.“There’s clearly a risk of a recession –\u0026nbsptwo consecutive quarterly contractions –\u0026nbspbut we’re not expecting one,” said\u0026nbspPaul Dales, economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbsp“Much of the probable weakness in the second quarter is because the risk of a no deal on 29\u0026nbspMarch meant that activity was shifted from the second quarter into the first quarter,” he explained.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSeparate official figures also released on Wednesday showed that Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in May due mainly to a smaller deficit in goods trade.\u0026nbspMr Dales said the gap in goods narrowed “simply because the surge in imports ahead of the original Brexit deadline of 29 March has been reversed”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

Critics have been marvelling at the film\u0027s “beautiful effects” which have been described as a “game-changer” for VFX.The “gorgeous score”, including tracks by Glover and Beyoncé, has also received high praise.Many have also complimented the voice cast, as well as remarking on how funny and moving they found the film.In the remake, Glover voices Simba, the lion cub whose birthright was robbed by his wicked uncle Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and who goes out into the wilderness, befriending warthog Pumbaa\u0026nbsp(Seth Rogen) and meerkat Timon (Billy Eichner) on his travels.Beyonce portrays Nala, Simba’s best friend, with James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original films as Simba’s father Mufasa.The Lion King will hit UK cinemas on 19 July 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Five other Navy vessels – three Indian and two Emirati – were reported to have been involved in the operation. The governments of both countries provided little information as to what had taken place.Before fleeing, Princess Latifa had recorded a video saying that were it to be released, “either I am dead, or in a very, very bad situation”, and accused her father of severely mistreating her and her sister, Shamsa. These allegations have been strongly denied.\u0026nbspPrincess Shamsa had fled from her father’s estate, near Chobham in Surrey, in 2000. She was seen in Cambridge in August that year before disappearing. She later turned up in Dubai after, allegedly, being forced back home.Haya\u0026nbspin Dubai in 2016 (Getty)In the photographs with Princess Haya and Ms Robinson, 33-year-old Princess Latifa was unsmiling, looking listless. Ms Robinson subsequently gave an interview to BBC Radio 4 in which she described Latifa as a “troubled young woman” who regretted making the video claiming abuse.Human rights groups accused the former Irish president of repeating the Emirati royal family’s propaganda she responded she was merely giving her views after being invited to the meeting by Princess Haya, her friend.\u0026nbspSeven months on, and Princess Haya has herself fled the UAE. She\u0026nbspis now living in London at a house near Kensington Palace, which she bought from Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire Indian born steel magnate, for £85m two years ago.\u0026nbspShe has asked for police protection and has also engaged a private security firm that has senior former Scotland Yard officers in its hierarchy.We can see the power the UAE has in Great Britain, it forced the government to carry out an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood, who the Emiratis hate. What happens if there is an asylum application and it’s rejected?Princess Haya, educated at Badminton School then\u0026nbspSt Hilda’s College at Oxford, knows members of the British royal family, including the Queen and Prince Charles.\u0026nbspShe is said to have asked for political asylum and there is also talk of legal proceedings for orce from Sheikh Mohammed and custody of the couples’ two children, a seven-year-old daughter and an 11-year-old son. The sheikh has 21 other children with his other wives.\u0026nbspThe princess is being represented by Fiona Shackleton QC who acted for Prince Charles in his orce from Princess Diana, as well as for Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Sir Paul McCartney.Radha Stirling, the founder of the pressure group\u0026nbspDetained in Dubai, who had been in contact with Princess Latifa during her abortive escape attempt and had raised the issue of the disappearance of Princess Shamsa with British police, has offered help to Princess Haya’s legal team.Zelensky represents a clear triumph over anti-semitism in UkraineSheikh Mohammed is being represented by Helen Ward QC who has\u0026nbspacted for Andrew Lloyd Webber, Paloma Picasso, Guy Ritchie, Bernie Ecclestone and Princess Diana’s stepmother Countess Raine Spencer.\u0026nbspThere have\u0026nbspbeen a number of reasons offered for Princess Haya’s departure from Dubai. One is that she apparently found out what really happened to Latifa and Shamsa and felt she could no longer continue to be a member of the royal family and live safely in Dubai.Another claim holds that Princess Haya incurred Sheikh Mohammed’s anger by becoming too close to a bodyguard,\u0026nbspa former British Army officer. One former British\u0026nbspsoldier, involved in the private security sector in the Gulf, says:\u0026nbsp“There were definite rumours of a Barry Mannakee kind around for a while, I don’t know if it’s true or not – the guy involved is back in the UK. You won’t see him in the Gulf any time soon, I suspect.”Mannakee was a police personal protection officer for Princess Diana and allegedly had an affair with her. He was moved from his post and later died in a motorcycle crash. No evidence has been produced to show that Princess Haya was intimate with the bodyguard, who works for a UAE-owned security company.\u0026nbspLast month, Sheikh Mohammed posted a poem on his website, written in a classical Arabic style known as\u0026nbsphija or\u0026nbspinvective. On the theme of perfidy and betrayal, it said: “The era of your lies has ended ... You no longer have any place with me ... I do not care if you live or die.”Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum ‘being detained against her will’ after failed escape from UAEAn entire section of Sheikh Mohammed’s website is dedicated to these poems. They are inspired, it says, from “personal experience, event or situation”. The sheikh stresses:\u0026nbsp“I have never written any verse without it being a reality of my life.”Emirati officials complain that opponents of the royal family and the government are seeking to use personal issues for agendas of their own. Their explanation of the Princess Latifa case, for instance, is that it is an attempt at blackmail.\u0026nbspThey point to an interview given by Helene Jaubert, the ex-wife of Herve Jaubert, on\u0026nbspThe Daily Beast website in which she claimed: “The whole plan was for Herve to help her escape and once he got her out, the daughter was going to get to the dad and say I want $3m or else I’ll tell all to the media. It was a con. It’s a corrupt scheme gone haywire.”Haya’s\u0026nbspfriends\u0026nbspfear UAE influence may see her asylum application rejected\u0026nbsp(AFPGetty)The allegation is strongly denied by Princess Latifa’s friends, and by Herve Jaubert.\u0026nbspThe Emiratis also point to links between Detained in Dubai and people such as Shahid King Bolsen, an American convert to Islam\u0026nbspwho served seven years in jail for manslaughter in Dubai, and who The New York Times once described\u0026nbspas “an internet provocateur” for Islamist causes.\u0026nbspThere are also claims from Emirati sources that regional rivals Qatar and Iran are behind stories of royal feuds.The whole plan was for Herve to help her escape and once he got her out the daughter was going to get to the dad and say I want $3m or else I’ll tell all to the media. It was a con. It’s a corrupt scheme gone haywireNo evidence has been provided to back this charge, but there are possible political ramifications to what is unfolding with Princess Haya.\u0026nbspThere have been reports that the UAE\u0026nbspasked the British government to help return Princess Haya home. This is denied by authorities in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.However, it seems highly improbable that someone with Princess Haya’s influential connections in this country, and resources, not least formidable legal ones, would allow her to be simply deported back to the Emirates.\u0026nbspThere are other possibilities of diplomatic and political friction. Princess Haya is the daughter of the late ruler of Jordan, King Hussein\u0026nbspthe current ruler, King Abdullah, is her half-brother.Haya marries Sheikh Mohammed in April 2004 (Getty)Jordan’s finances are in difficult straits. The country is dependent on the Emirates as well as Saudi Arabia, and relies on the millions of dollars in remittances sent home by tens of thousands of Jordanians working in the Gulf.The peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians, the economic part of which was recently presented by Jared Kushner in Bahrain, also does little favour to Jordan, which hosts a very large number of Palestinian refugees. Amman has consistently pushed for a two-state solution, the prospects for which are pushed even further back by Donald Trump’s son-in-law’s proposals. Jordan would need Emirati and Saudi help to cope with problems this is likely to pose.At the same time, Princess Haya, an Olympic equestrian for Jordan, is hugely popular in the country and any perception of mistreatment of her would lead to resentment, which may in turn affect Jordanians working in the Gulf.\u0026nbspThe story of the princess and her departure from the Emirati royal family will have widespread repercussions, well beyond the confines of the High Court in London.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It shows swallows swooping among clusters of red lilliesArchaeologists now believe that, in order to construct the complex, early Bronze Age Greeks embarked on at least 3,500 maritime voyages to transport between 7,000 and 10,000 tonnes of shining white marble from one Aegean island to another. Each return voyage would have required up to 24 crew members to paddle for around five hours.“It is by far the largest prehistoric marine transport operation that has ever come to light anywhere in the world,” said Dr Julian Whitewright, a leading maritime archaeologist at the University of Southampton.“It demonstrates quite clearly just how important, and integral to their culture, seafaring was to these early Bronze Age Aegean people.”The voyages – totalling around 45,000 miles – allowed the architects to construct what is thought to have been a huge religious sanctuary consisting of up to 60 marble buildings which were constructed specifically to glisten in the sun.Dhaskalio, off the Cycladic island of Keros (Cambridge Keros Project)What’s more, the architects ‘terra-formed’ the pyramid-shaped island ‘mini-mountain’, known in recent centuries as Dhaskalio (possibly just meaning ‘islet’), to create around a thousand metres of artificial terracing, arranged in six ‘steps’ on its steep slopes.These roughly six metre wide terraces appear to have been built specifically to accommodate all the buildings. The summit itself was not initially built on – but instead had a small probably sacred open area where votive offerings may have been deposited.“Our investigation has been transforming our understanding of early Bronze Age Cycladic culture and suggests that these very early Greeks were organisationally, technically and politically much more advanced than previously thought,” said the project’s co-director, Michael Boyd of Cambridge University’s McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.Nothing like this monumental complex has ever been found from this period in or around Greece before.Rise and fall of ancient civilisations revealed by Arctic pollutionAlthough the current archaeological investigations on Dhaskalio have been going on for the past four years, its only more detailed examination of the resultant data over the past 12 months that has revealed the true scale of the complex and the transport logistics and construction work associated with it.But the remarkable nature of the site does fit into a much more widely dispersed series of monumental construction traditions from western Europe and the Middle East.Intriguingly, it was built within 100 years or so of the creation of Stonehenge, the first Egyptian pyramids, the great cities of the Indus Valley and the first known Mesopotamian kingdoms.This broader context shows quite clearly that Dhaskalio was part of a much wider cultural and political phenomenon involving huge ultra-ambitious construction and political projects. These Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Indus Valley and western European traditions were almost certainly not directly related to each other – but were probably the result of a common stimulus, namely the spread and intensification of early metal usage, and the mercantile, cultural and political changes that process triggered.Equally significantly, Dhaskalio shows that, contrary to previous belief, Greece was part and parcel of that much wider phenomenon.While the inidual buildings on Dhaskalio were not themselves truly monumental, the complex as a whole certainly was.The 7,000-10,000 tonnes of white marble, needed for the project, were quarried in the south-east part of Naxos, a large island around 6.5 miles northwest of Dhaskalio. Each return trip from Naxos to Dhaskalio would therefore have been around 13 miles.Images of Aegean Cycladic boats survive – so it is known that they were each only 10-15 metres long and capable of carrying only between one\u0026nbspand two\u0026nbsptonnes of cargo.Site of ancient massacre yields the secrets of a lost Greek cityThe prehistoric Aegean project engineers then had to create the mountainside terraces to accommodate the dozens of white marble buildings – some of which were two-storey and up to 10 metres long. Because the entire complex was constructed according to a set plan with buildings of very similar design, it is thought that the entire island sanctuary was constructed over a relatively short period – probably between 20 and 40 years. Its existence – and the huge and consistent organisation of labour and transport that had to be deployed – strongly suggests that there was a strong and stable political entity involved, potentially based on Keros or possibly Naxos.From the south, the island would have been visible from many miles away as a gleaming white pyramid-shaped mini-mountain rising out of the sea.It is not known for sure whether the pyramidic shape was in any way significant. But the place had certainly been specifically selected as a religious site in preference to other much higher, more impressive and potentially more accessible mountains that did not have that shape. What’s more, pyramidic shapes were, at precisely that time, coming to be regarded as sacred just 500 miles to the southeast in ancient Egypt (Indeed it is also at that time that there are the first signs of Egyptian influence on nearby Crete).Badisches Landesmuseum, Karlsruhe, Germany)In the ancient Egyptian context, pyramid shapes were associated with a god of creation, Atum. He was believed to inhabit a pyramid-shaped rock (a “pyramidion” or “Benben”\u0026nbspstone) that was seen as symbolising the mythical “primordial mound”\u0026nbsp(representing the first dry land) which (much as in the Biblical story of creation) rose out of a “sea of chaos”\u0026nbspat the time of creation. What’s more, that pyramidic stone symbolised the sacred place where the first rays of the Sun illuminated the primordial mound at the time of creation – and the pyramidic shape of the pyramidion (the idealised primordial mound) was seen as symbolising the slanting rays of the sun as they descended from the sky to earth. Indeed, the ancient Egyptians used to cover their symbolic “pyramidions”\u0026nbspin gold leaf so that they would shine and glisten in the sun (potentially for the same or similar reasons that the Dhaskalio architects went to so much trouble to ensure that their pyramid-shaped island sanctuary would also glisten in the rays of the Sun).The Mesopotamians and others had similar ‘primordial mound rising out of watery chaos’ creation myths – and it is conceivable that Dhaskalio rising out of the sea symbolises some Cycladic version of those wider sacred cosmological concepts.Archaeologists discover long-lost tools used to build StonehengeArchaeologists discover eight ancient mummies in EgyptArchaeologists begin examining 10,000 years of history along HS2 routeIn the early Greek world, it is conceivable that the concept of the sacred mountain was exported from Dhaskalio to Crete and perhaps ultimately from there to mainland Greece.Certainly the main concentration of sacred (sometimes distinctly pyramid-shaped) mountains in Crete are in an area directly associated with what appears to have been Early Bronze Age colonisers from the Cycladic islands.Those Cretan sacred mountains and mountaintop religious sanctuaries appear to precede the eventual emergence on the Greek mainland of Mount Olympus as the principal home of the gods of ancient Greece.In religious and probably political terms, Dhaskalio seems to have had an unexpectedly important role in the early cultural development of the Greek world.“It is potentially a fundamental place of origin for the phenomenon of sacred mountains within the Greek world,” said the world’s leading expert on Greek mountaintop sanctuaries, Dr Alan Peatfield of University College Dublin’s School of Archaeology.The archaeological investigations on the islet are being carried out with the support of the Greek Ministry of Culture by archaeologists from Britain, Greece, Germany, France, Australia, the US\u0026nbspand half a dozen other countries. They are being funded by the US-based Institute for Aegean Prehistory, the Cyprus-based AG Leventis Foundation and the Athens-based the Stavros Niarchos Foundation. Major support is also being provided by the British-Academy-funded British School at Athens and the internationally-funded Cyprus Institute. The excavations and analysis of the finds are being directed by British archaeologists, Professor Colin Renfrew and Michael Boyd, both of Cambridge University’s McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.The finds from Dhaskalio are currently being investigated in great detail.Of particular interest are 1500 imported stone disks (each between eight and 50 centimetres in diameter) – and 700 imported white pebbles. The latter objects appear to have been used as religious offerings, presumably for the spirit or deity associated with the island mini-mountain.The discs came from various different Cycladic islands, while the pebbles were imported solely from the neighbouring island of Upper Koufonisi, three miles northwest of Dhaskalio.Very significantly, this practice of using stone discs and depositing pebbles seems to have ultimately been exported to Crete by Cycladic colonisers for use on Cretan sacred mountain sites.ScanPyramids project shows methods used to ‘see-through’ the Great PyramidThe archaeologists are also examining 36 small complete marble statues, unearthed on Dhaskalio – as well as evidence that very substantial numbers of copper daggers, spearheads, axes and other tools were manufactured on the sacred islet (conceivably as magical talismans for pilgrims to take home with them).What’s more, just 100 metres away from the sacred islet, on the extreme western end of the island of Keros, early Bronze Age pilgrims deposited more than a thousand ritually broken religious marble figurines (mainly depicting women in symbolic form), again brought there from all over the Cycladic Archipelago. Also ritually deposited there were literally thousands of blades and other tools manufactured at or very near the deposition site, but made of obsidian (natural volcanic glass) mainly imported from the Cycladic island of Milos.Today Dhaskalio is a small island – but back in the Early Bronze Age, it was linked to that deposition site on Keros by a natural sandbank causeway. Perhaps Dhaskalio was considered so sacred that ordinary pilgrims could not even set foot on it – and had to leave their offerings near the Keros end of the causeway, presumably for the sacred islet’s spirit or deity to duly collect.Only further research will help determine Dhaskalio’s precise role in the early history of Greece and what it symbolised.But whether the pyramid-shaped islet was simply a spectacular religious sanctuary or whether it also potentially symbolised the emergence of the first land out of the waters of chaos at Creation may never be known.• Although both Dhaskalio and Keros are strictly closed to visitors, the world’s first ever exhibition on the recent archaeological finds from the ancient islet sanctuary will be held from 14 July to 30 September on the nearby island of Upper Koufonisi.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the committee, said: “Public benefits from the settlement with Eurotunnel amount to little more than window dressing.“The taxpayer has been landed with a £85m bill with very little to show for it following the rushed procurement of ferry freight capacity.”Travel after Brexit: All you need to know about Eurostar and ferriesGovernment forced to pay Eurotunnel £33m over no-deal ferry farceEurotunnel, Russel Hobbs, Facebook: Business news in brief, Thursday 2Eurotunnel make €29m claim on taxpayers over refugee crisis The MPs also warned the DfT about a lack of preparedness for the next deadline for leaving the European Union, 31 October 2019.The committee said: “The department must learn from this episode and use its time well should it be required to re-procure ferry capacity ahead of the new October deadline.“The window for decision-making for any departure on 31 October is short and key deadlines for decisions are passing every day.“There is a real risk that the short time left before 31 October will force the department into further high-risk procurements.A DfT spokesperson said: “The freight capacity contracts were taken out as an insurance policy for the UK to ensure that key medical supplies could be guaranteed in the event of a no-deal Brexit.“This step was in response to changed assumptions about potential delays in the Dover strait, and the agreements were entered into as soon as a cross-government collective decision was taken that they were needed.“Two weeks ago the department outlined a new framework proposal to provide a list of operators capable of delivering this vital freight capacity without the government committing to any agreements at this stage, with market engagement already under way.”The DfT is facing more legal action relating to the Eurotunnel settlement.

Crucially, Labour would campaign for Remain in such a referendum.However, Jeremy Corbyn is keeping his options open about the party’s position at a general election – a\u0026nbspgrowing prospect, as\u0026nbspBoris Johnson, the clear frontrunner in the Tory leadership race, might seek an election if the Commons blocks no deal, while MPs could force an election to stop a\u0026nbspcrash-out.Labour pro-Europeans believe that it would now be inconceivable for the party to fight an election without supporting\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsp“two Rs” – referendum and Remain. But Mr Corbyn has not gone that far. Labour’s manifesto will be decided when an election is called, leaving open the possibility that a Labour government could seek its own Brexit deal, based on a customs union.If that were put to a confirmatory referendum, many Labour figures would have a dilemma. It would be virtually impossible for the leadership to campaign against its own agreement, but Mr Corbyn might permit his ministers and MPs\u0026nbspto campaign either for the deal or Remain. He has been reading up on how Harold Wilson, the then Labour prime minister, allowed such freedom\u0026nbspin the 1975\u0026nbsp Europe referendum.\u0026nbspCorbyn tells next PM to call new Brexit referendumFor now, Mr Corbyn is still trying to appeal to Remainers and Leavers, and can’t keep everyone happy. His support for a referendum and a Remain vote on any Tory deal has angered pro-Brexit Labour MPs representing Leave areas in the north and midlands, who\u0026nbspwarn it will cost the party the next election.\u0026nbsp But keeping alive a Labour deal does not go far enough for some Labour Remainers, and\u0026nbspallows the Liberal Democrats and Greens to argue that Labour is still pro-Brexit.\u0026nbspThere could be pressure on Mr Corbyn to come out unequivocally for Remain at Labour’s annual conference in September. Without that, Labour might still struggle to explain its complex policy on the doorsteps.\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s new stance makes it slightly more likely that there could be a Commons majority for a Final Say referendum. In\u0026nbspa Commons vote in April, 203 Labour MPs supported a people’s vote and 24 opposed it, while 20 abstained, some of whom might now back the move if the new prime minister put a revised deal to MPs.\u0026nbspIn April, a referendum was defeated by 12 votes.\u0026nbspOnly 14 Tory MPs supported the proposal, so more would probably be needed to forge a majority. That could happen if a Final Say vote became a mechanism to stop no deal. But time would be very short. A government actively pursuing no deal could ignore a non-binding Commons vote for a referendum, and refuse to bring in the necessary legislation. So opponents of a crash-out may have to find other ways of preventing one.Labour’s shift towards Remain might just increase the temptation for\u0026nbspPM Johnson\u0026nbspto seek a mandate for no deal at an election, as he eyed up marginal seats in the north and midlands. Then Mr Corbyn could no longer put off his final decision on whether Labour should become a Remain party.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have already agreed to field only one candidate in next month’s Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, and Unite for Remain is designed to encourage a similar approach across the country.Ms Allen will chair the group’s advisory council, which will consist of the party\u0026nbspleaders and senior figures from\u0026nbspthe Remain parties. Insiders said it\u0026nbspwas important that the initiative was led by an independent MP who did not have an agenda in favour of any particular party.Unite for Remain\u0026nbspis aiming to form an alliance in between 150 and 180 seats across the country, although the unwillingness of the SNP to take part means it is unlikely to focus its efforts on Scottish constituencies.Donors have also been lined up to help support candidates who stand under the Unite to Remain banner.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Allen said voters were “crying out” for parties to work together, and that the “high likelihood” of a general election required “urgent” action to boost the number of Remain-supporting MPs. \u0026nbspShe said: “Brexit has shifted the tectonic plates and shifted politics and our way of operating more than anything before. With both Labour and the Tories moving to the extremes, people just don’t recognise politics any more.“The only way we’re going to break out of that under first-past-the-post is to learn to work differently. I’m genuinely encouraged by the appetite in all the parties to try. We might not succeed and get as many seats as we’d like but we need to try to build a genuine centre-ground, internationalist movement.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyInsisting that there was significant support for a new alliance, she added: “The risk of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage twinkling over the horizon has really focused people’s minds. It is unprecedented. People in party politics don’t typically behave like this but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the appetite.”Ms Allen said Unite for Remain would prioritise \u0026nbsp“modern, country-first, cross-party collaboration across the nation” and added: \u0026nbsp“Our country is crying out for mature and progressive politics, not a government elected to pursue old ideology from the left or right.

Based on poor data from timelier business surveys, a number of economists think the economy contracted for the first time in seven years in the second quarter, and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics did not change that view.\u0026nbspThe May car production figures were flattered by a plunge in April when many plants had no choice but to go ahead with planned closures ahead of the previous Brexit deadline of\u0026nbsp29 March.\u0026nbspA longer-term and less-volatile measure of GDP showed that, in the three months to May, economic output rose 0.3 per cent compared with the three months ending in February. That marked\u0026nbspa deterioration from the first quarter when growth stood at 0.5 per cent.“Although there was a modest rally in GDP growth between April and May, the continued slowdown on the underlying three-month measure is further evidence that the UK economy is faltering under the weight of relentless Brexit uncertainty and tougher global economic conditions,” said\u0026nbspSuren\u0026nbspThiru, economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.“Manufacturing activity picked up in May as car production reopened, but the longer-term measures point to a sector under pressure from the running down of excess stock, tougher global trading conditions and rising upfront costs.”Created with Sketch.

roads and caused several injuries while seismologists warned that large aftershocks were expected to continue, according to reports.The epicentre was close to the city of Ridgecrest, about 140 miles north east of Los Angeles.The quake – preceded by Thursday’s 6.4-magnitude temblor in the Mojave Desert, was the largest in southern California for at least 20 years.It was followed by a series of large and small aftershocks, including a handful above magnitude 5.0.On Monday, officials said it could be several more days before water service was restored to the desert town of Trona, where officials trucked in portable toilets and showers.\u0026nbspTen residences in Trona were listed as uninhabitable and officials expected that number to rise as inspectors complete more surveys of the

There, they\u0027re looked over by veterinarians and outfitted with tracking collars before being trucked to the Cascades and once again flown by helicopter, this time into their new alpine habitats.The relocations began last year, following a years-long stretch of planning and public comment, with 115 of the roughly 725 mountain goats in the Olympics being moved to the Cascades.Officials captured 17 Monday and Tuesday at the start of a two-week goat relocation period, including a kid about 6 weeks old, which got a ride on a mugger\u0027s lap inside the helicopter instead of hanging beneath it.Created with Sketch.Goats in trees Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Moroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats in an argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats climbing an argan tree to feedA Moroccan goat in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing at an argan treeA kid perched in an argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats in an argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats climbing an argan tree to feedA Moroccan goat in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeMoroccan goats grazing at an argan treeA kid perched in an argan treeMoroccan goats grazing in argan treeThe Olympics have few natural salt licks. That makes it more likely goats there will be attracted to the sweat, urine and food of hikers, potentially endangering the hikers. One goat fatally gored a hiker in 2010.A coalition of state and federal agencies and American Indian tribes is behind the effort, which involves closing parts of the park, including the Seven Lakes Basin and Klahhane Ridge. A second two-week closure period is planned for August.Two ‘rhino poachers’ die after crashing into goat“Mountain goat relocation will allow these animals to reoccupy historical range areas in the Cascades,” Jesse Plumage, a U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologist, said in a news release.The capture of the goats was contracted out to Leading Edge Aviation, a company that specialises in animal capture and relocation.The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife plans to release the goats at six sites in the Cascades. They include the Chikamin area in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Preacher Mountain in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Hardscrabble Ridge and mountain peaks south of Darrington.Rich Harris, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife biologist leading the agency\u0027s work to move the goats, told The Seattle Times this month that of those relocated last year, about 65 to 70 survived the winter. Half of the 10 relocated kids survived, he said.Agencies contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this requires time and planning, not random comments detached from an ongoing, respectful discourse.”Israeli media said that Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, “pushed back” on Mr\u0026nbspPeretz’s remarks and said Israel needed “to stop disregarding and looking down on Jews in America that see themselves as Jews not only religiously but even more culturally and historically”.Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly concluded the conversation saying that a growing number of American Jews are drifting away from Jewish traditions.\u0026nbspIt is not the first time that far-right politicians in Israel have likened assimilation to the Holocaust.Haaretz reported that last year Uri Ariel, Israel’s agriculture minister and a member of Jewish Home,\u0026nbsppart of the United Right, sent a letter to employees discussing the “assimilation Holocaust” that stated:\u0026nbsp“During the Holocaust, we’ve lost about six million Jews.

It’s in really bad shape with paint peeling off the walls and is quite ugly.Before she can launch into the project and turn these crumbling ruins into the holiday home of her dreams, there is one big sticking point: Italy’s hellish red tape.Property boundary maps dont exist here - and she will need a translator to sign the purchase deed as she’s a foreigner.Im still going through all the paperwork hassle but hopefully it’ll be done by the end of July,” she says.Over  € dwellings have so far been sold in Mussomeli, mainly to European and Americans, while another  are potentially available.The most successful town in the scheme so far has been Gangi in Sicily where the mayor has sold over  abandoned homes, mainly to foreign buyers, some as far away as China.Kathleen Sparks, a  year-old publisher and her husband Garreth Powis, a finance manager, applied for a € house online in Mussomeli earlier this year and were subsequently contacted by the production company to take part in the show.“We had just applied for a € house online when the TV people came knocking at our door in London as the mayor had forwarded our contacts,” explains Kathleen.“They asked us why we wanted to do this and we told them: that we wanted a second holiday home in Italy which we could rent when we were in London. They showed us pictures of available properties, small ones, big ones, all more or less crumbling down, even before we flew over to Sicily.”The couple have only just ed from a visit to the town where they were given a tour by the local authorities and shown all the available houses and eventually picked one they liked.“So far we’ve paid just € for a -storey building and hope to buy the one next door to enlarge it, but that would have a higher price and there are issues with our paperwork,” explains Kathleen.“Apparently the property map is missing but the mayor told me all will be soon ready for when wethis summer and the TV will be there to film us entering our new home and meeting with the architect and builders for the renovation.”The couple hopes that starring in the TV show will give “good exposure” to their new holiday rental and get holidaymakers flocking.Guess we will need to tune in to the new show to seetheir holiday rental flies or flops...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, really.Christine Lagarde, replacing Mario Draghi as European Central Bank president, was a proud cheerleader for Project Fear in her role as head of the International Monetary Fund, predicting the UK’s collapsewe dared vote for Brexit.And Charles Michel, the lame duck Belgium Prime Minister replacing Donald Tusk as EU Council President, has consistently dismissed Brexit as a contemptible little “soap opera”.Come back, Jean-Claude Drunker — all is forgiven!I have seen these appointments described as a “huge headache” for the next British Prime Minister.On the contrary, having an elite of Brexit-bashing, Brit-loathing Eurocrats spitting their federalist poison at us makes leaving the EU inevitable.Nothing is more likely to finally get us out of the European Union than having a sneering, bossy rabble of democracy-denying nonentities wagging their fingers in our faces.I wouldn’t trust the EU Ayatollahs to run a whelk stall.Charles Michel’s major claim to fame is that he became Belgium’s youngest ever PM in , despite his party coming third in the elections.Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence in  over a financial scandal in France but spared jail time and allowed to keep her job.She is the first female head of the European Central Bank and also the first who has no background in economics.Despite her eight years as head of the IMF, Lagarde is a lawyer and a politician. So best of luck saving the Euro, Christine.Ursula von der Leyen’s nomination as EU Commission President has provoked outrage in her native Germany, where it is perceived as an undeserved reward for miserable failure.Frau von der Leyen’s six years as defence minister earned her the reputation as “the worst minister in Germany” and being promoted to President of the EU Commission is seen as getting “kicked upstairs” by her friend, Chancellor Angela Merkel.Certainly there is nothing on Ursula’s CV to warrant such a promotion.As defence minister, Frau von der Leyen prioritised creches and flexible working hours for Germany’s armed forces.Funding shortages became so dire on her watch that on a Nato training exercise in Norway, German troops were obliged to use broomsticks painted black instead of guns.I don’t fancy her EU army’s chances against the Russians.But I would bet they have childcare facilities to die for.Unelected by the people, unaccountable to the people and contemptuous of the people, this next generation of Eurocrats remind us why the British have no future inside this arrogant empire.Yes, Brexit has been an agony.But the appointment of the EU’s new Ayatollahs prove that remaining is unthinkable.BRIAN JONES, the original Rolling Stone, died  years ago this week.“No Jones, no Stones,” said Bill Wyman. “He formed the band.

Not a regular port of call because I’m a Good Morning Britain devotee thanks, in no small part, to the Great Sussex Doughnut hole, Piers Morgan, who took one look at its saccharine sweet format, back in , and thought: “Sod that for roasting politicians and a few home truths.”His tabloid instincts didn’t let him down. Its predecessor GMTV used to be such an easy ride Gordon Brown actually offered its host Fiona Phillips a Government job.These days, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and PM-in-waiting Boris Johnson are both too spineless to go anywhere near the GMB studio.BBC pay was the big story last week, though, so I had to desert ship for Breakfast, where I immediately discovered no one’s paid quite enough to work a five-day week and a squad rotation system is at play.Thursday and Friday it was the horribly mismatched Charlie “errr” Stayt and Naga Munchetty, who are both on £, but have so little on-screen chemistry they make Piers’ and Susanna’s squabbling sound more like Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin — Je t’aime . . . moi non plus, Chunk.Star pairing, however, are the undoubtedly talented and likeable Dan Walkerand Louise Minchinwho can actually bear to look at her co-host and almost won me over with Wednesday’s first link of the day. “Day three of Wimbledon and Carolisn’t looking quite so lovely.”No. And you should see her at the end of the fortnight, Louise.It’s not the clumsiness or the lack of chemistry, though, that make Breakfast feel like you’re stuck with Saturday Superstore when Tiswas is on the other side.

We always appreciate your feedback.”I hope, then, that Dan Walker appreciates me saying his show’s hypocrisy is every bit as nauseating as the BBC’s excess, ’cos no autocue reader should be paid anything more than £, when pensioners are having to pay for their licence.AndBBC staffers don’t like that figure  Well, they’re free to offer their talents to the private sector and I’ll be sure to tip Naga Munchetty heavily when she arrives with my Deliveroo order, as I really liked the pointed question she posed about a nuisance barnyard animal, on Friday’s paper review.“Is anyone interested in a noisy cock ”To my own surprise and horror, I am.

Not all the viewers, obviously.Just those few hundred who’ve got Ofcom on speed-dial and are forever accusing someone of “gaslighting” or claiming someone  needs to be removed “for their own safety”.Clearly no one’s explained to these cretins it’s an ITV dating show, not Channel ’s Dispatches, and objecting to jealousy or lust not only misses the show’s entire point, it threatens to ruin the meagre pleasures of watching Love Island.For me, last week, that mainly involved trying to catch a single glimpse of George the builder, a blond Essex vacuum, who’d been looking like the sparest part inLove Island history, until “partner” Lucie and Maura pulled him and Marvin aside for a Sunday night chat. Can he fix it Maura: “I’ve tried, she’s tried. There’s no point in prolonging this bulls**t. That’s it.”No he can’t.Top Gear jumping on the rainbow flag-waving bandwagon with the emptiest Pride gesture of all time.People who say “challenging behaviour” when they mean “disruptive little turd”.Snowflake Love Island fans complaining about absolutely everything.Loose Woman Janet Street-Porter constantly name-dropping all her famous friends .And the Norwich City fan, on Channel ’s Drag SOS, who thought the way to stand out from the Carrow Road crowd was wearing a tutu and wig, when ten fingers and two eyes really would’ve done it.EASTENDERS had a real opportunity recently.Louise Mitchell was locked in a shipping container, bound for Odessa, in the Ukraine, with plenty of space for the rest of the deadwood, Denise, Hunter, Kim, Denny, Bobby, Honey, Sonia, Bernie, Robbie and Adam, who could all have been as quickly for- gotten as Ben Mitchell’s forgotten he’s deaf.Instead, some imbecile left a mobile phone inside the container, she escaped and the moment was gone for ever.

There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Sommarøy — or Summer Island — about an hour’s drive from the city of Tromsø and with a population of just , has also found itself at the centre of controversy.A press release put out by Norway’s state-funded enterprise agency Innovation Norway about their plans prompted a backlash, with some accusing them of spreading “fake news”.Calls have been made for Innovation Norway’s director to quit, with claims the “misguided publicity stunt” cost Norwegian taxpayers more than £,.Kjell, a sixth-generation is- lander, appeared shaken by the media storm.The -year-old dad of three said he travelled to Oslo with local MP Kent Gudmundsen to hand over the petition, and the photos were not staged.He said: “It’s never been my intention to do something fake. We know it’s true.”He views the bid as merely underlining what the islanders do already, and added: “The goal is to get the time-free zone formalised.“Is it likely to be approved  I doubt it, but it’s worth a try.”Over a coffee in front of breathtaking views, Kjell said he came up with the idea after deciding to quit his job in the island’s only hotel last year.He added: “People asked meI was ill but I said no, I just decided to take my time back.“Many people are getting over- whelmed with time pressure, and how they don’t take the time to actually live their lives.“My family can tell you how hard I was working but my passion has now become helping others to have a better le.”Kjell has not owned a watch for five years. If he needs to know the time he just looks at where the sun is in the sky.Earlier, as we drove over the bridge to the island, I noticed the abandoned watches. So in order to truly live like a local, we pulled over and I attached mine to the railings too.Due to the Earth’s tilt on its axis, and in contrast to the summer months, Sommarøy is cloaked in continuous darkness for a large part of winter, so it is no surprise that locals take full advantage of   daylight.No one uses fixed times and when making plans, islanders will always say: “See you later.”Immersing myself in island le, I headed out at .pm for a bike ride in bright sunshine, stopping to make a sandcastle on the beach around .pm.Then it was on to the Nord Sommarøy Outdoor Centre, whose midnight sun kayaking tours are hugely popular.By then I was told it was am, but after a quick change we hiked up a mountain.At am we reached the top, from where we could see Sommarøy bathed in a glorious golden glow. Below, we spotted a group of teenagers tearing around the island on bikes.I was reminded of something Kjell told me earlier, that in summer, children don’t have a bedtime here. At night, Sommarøy becomes their playground.Earlier, islander Hal Ludvigsen told me: “We get  days of sunshine but we pay for it with no sun in winter.“When the sun is back, we know the value. People say, ‘How do you know when to eat and when to go to bed ’ Well, we eat when we’re hungry and go to bed when we’re tired.”In winter Hal, , hosts Northern Lights tours and earns enough to see him through summer. His favourite place to see the midnight sun is the Hekkingen Lighthouse.For the boat ride over, we were joined by his girlfriend Lena Olsson, who is Swedish but moved to Sommarøy two years ago after falling in love with Hal — and the island.She said: “It gets you in the heart when you see it. Sweden is a beautul country but this is paradise. It’s very special here. There is no stress.”As -year-old Lena unpacked a picnic, Hal said: “We always come here at midnight. It’s perfect. The sun is beautul, like gold on the sea.”Back on land, at the island’s hotel, I finally managed to get some shut-eye, sleeping from .am to am — and was glad my room had blackout blinds.I put on an eye mask as well, just in case any light got through. I may have given up my watch, but I wasn’t going to give up sleeping too.Sommarøy’s ferry boat captain, Ketil Voll, hasn’t even surrendered his watch yet — though he does agree with making the island timeless.The -year-old said: “This was a good thing so people can think about how they spend their time. It’s made me realise I should work less and spend more time with my family.And while there have been claims that the move would be bad for tourism, there is no denying it has put Sommarøy firmly on the map.With a wry chuckle, Hal said: “People from Sommarøy used to say they were from an island near Tromsø — but now people in Tromsø are saying they live near Sommarøy.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride.

So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub.

which youre lying in the centre of.The Sleep Advisor advises: Take a close look at your fan.If its been collecting dust on the blades, those particles are flying through the air every time you turn it on.And its not just hay fever sufferers who could wake up feeling rough after a breezy night.Sleeping with a fan on can also dry out your skin, which can lead to an overproduction of sebum...and ultimately acne.The Sleep Advisor also points out that having the fan on all night could even leave you with aches and pains in the morning, as the cool air causes your muscles to tense up and cramp.In Korea, theres even a theory that sleeping with an electric fan on will kill you.Fan death has been a concern in the country since the s, when a journal published a story warning readers that electric fans could cause sickness, facial paralysis and even asphyxiation due to the circulation of stale air.And apparently, that fear still exists today.While its extremely unlikely that an electrical fan will kill you, it may exacerbate existing medical issues.Soyou dont want to wake up with a sore neck, worse hay fever symptoms, and acne, then you might want to consider whether a fan is worth the aggro.. Sleep nakedIn the summer, it can be hard to regulate how hot our bedrooms become but other times, its a case of turning off your radiator, throwing open a window and donning your birthday suit.According to the National Sleep Foundation, the quicker you fall asleep, the better quality of sleep you tend to have. One way of reducing the amount of time it takes you to fall into a deep sleep is to lower your body temperature.Falling temperatures in the body tell it that its time for snoozing and a simple way to do that is to take off your clothes.Reducing body temperature not only helps you get off to sleep faster but may also improve the overall quality of your sleep.Although your body changes temperature throughout the night, going to sleep naked means that it doesnt have to cool down quite as vigorously and you can control the temperature more easily by removing or adding duvets and sheets.. Cold water bottleGrab your hot water bottle and fill it with icy slush.It might give you a bit of a shock in bed butyou are really struggling with overheating, its a good way of radiating out a cold hue in the sheets.. Freeze your sheetsSounds odd but putting your sheets in the freezer will make your bed beautully cool.Simply fold them into a waterproof bag and pop them in for  minutes before re-dressing your bed.. Have a flannelKeep a wet flannel by your bed and lie it over your eyes and press to your temples before you try to go to sleep.Apply it throughout the nightyou feel yourself coming over all hot and sweaty.. Use your blindsThe NHS recommends keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows.If this isnt possible, use light-coloured curtains and keep them closed , it explained.. Unplug technologyDid you know that plugged in chargers can emit heat It probably wont make a massive dference but youre better off moving any technology out of the bedroom and unplugging anything thats charging to reduce any extra heat.. Have a bathBefore you get into bed, have a cold shower or bath to take your body temperature down a bit.And once youre dry, get into bed in the nude. Youll feel far more refreshed and youll once again make sure that there are no rogue pollen particles nestling anywhere on your body or hair."},{"url":null,"title":"delta plane engine spinner emergency landing baltimore","story":"The -year-old aircraft was flying from Atlanta to Baltimore in the US on Monday when passengers heard a boom and spotted that one engines nose cone, or spinner, had broken off.About an hour into the flight, passengers said they heard a loud bang followed by smoke billowing into the cabin.Traveller Avery Porch told WMAR-TV: After we heard the boom, we just saw all this smoke come up into the cabin and thats when we really started freaking out.It started slowing down a little bit and it was getting hot.

So when it came to applying for disability benefit, they struggled in a world of websites and online forms. That was when Nick Leaman came to the rescue. The advisor with Bristol-based financial education charity Talking Money came to their house, and took care of everything. “Nick is a hero to us,” says Emlyn, . “He comes over and immediately puts you at ease. He knows exactly what to say and is so knowledgeable. “I am from the old school, and to understand something I need it in my hand. I don’t even know how to switch a computer on. But everything is online these days. I can’t even print out a form.  We are just relieved that Nick came over and explained everything to us and help us out.” Nick’s help was invaluable for the couple, who are both disabled and struggle to get out, and were falling behind on their rent. Nick’s work with Talking Money involves helping people who find themselves victims of fraud or who may be struggling with debts and don’t know where to turn. And the financially qualied advisor helps people access the benefits they are entitled to, with free specialist advice and ongoing support when they need it most. Over the last year the charity has received more than , enquiries and helped more than , people with advice and casework.They have also secured £.m for vulnerable low-income households by identying and applying for additional benefits they’re entitled to, including appealing negative decisions around housing benefit, sickness and disability benefits and Universal Credit .The majority of Nick’s work is through face to face consultations in Bristol and the surrounding area.  And he says many of his older clients struggle with the internet. “Older people are missing out because they can’t navigate online. I do feel compassion for them. They suffer from a lack of knowledge and access to information. Many of the best deals are online too so they miss out in that way too.” But the majority of people Nick helps are of working age. “It used to be the case that they had racked up huge credit card debts. But it has changed. The issues are now that they are struggling to pay rent and utility bills because they just don’t have the funds. Often they are in work, but they don’t get given enough hours or just not being paid enough. Or it might be the case they are facing financial crises because of unexpected le changes, such as relationship break-up, redundancy and bereavement. “It is also scary how much fraud is out there and how many people get scammed. Fraudsters are getting increasingly confident and can be so convincing. I had one lady who received a text saying she owed thousands to HMRC. It was a con, but she almost fell for it and was going to pay even though she was barely able to afford her rent. The problem is thatyou are desperate you are more likely to fall for scams like this because you just don’t think sensibly.” Despite the enormous demand on him, Nick loves his work. “It can be stressful but it is also really fulfilling because you are here to help people.  Evenyou can improve their lives just a little, that can make a huge dference to them.

Arguments over Brexit have been driving people apart in our communities and sometimes in the Labour Party too. As democrats, Labour accepted the result of the  referendum. In our  manesto we committed to oppose a No Deal Brexit and the Tories’ disastrous Brexit plans – which threaten jobs, living standards, and the open multicultural society that we as internationalists value so much. We developed a compromise plan based around a customs union, a strong single market relationship and protection of rights at work and environmental standards. We continue to believe this is a sensible alternative that could bring the country together. But the Prime Minister has refused to compromise and was unable to deliver, so we ended cross-party talks.    Now both Tory leadership candidates are threatening a No Deal Brexit – or at best a race to the bottom and a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump that runs down industry, opens up our NHS to yet more privatisation, and shreds standards on vital things like food safety and workers’ rights. I have spent the past few weeks consulting with all the dferent parts of the Labour movement – our members, MPs and the trade unions – on how we respond to this new situation. Whoever becomes the new Prime Minister, they should have the confidence to put their deal, or No Deal, back to the people in a public vote. In those circumstances, Labour would campaign for Remain against either No Deal or a Tory deal that threatens jobs and living standards.

You will not have heard anyone say: Jeremy Hunt  Brilliant! No-one has made the effort to describe what a great bloke Boris Johnson appears to be. And nobody, but nobody, has rhapsodised about what a great idea Brexit is for ages. While they spin, bluster and refuse to tell us what they wonapost do, itaposs the subjects theyaposre dancing around we all ought to be paying attention to. Subject : Sovereignty of Parliament The Brexit twats said we had to Brexit so Parliament had more power over our laws. Before we have even Brexited, they have decided Parliament has too much power, and should therefore be shut down so laws can be enacted without it. Subject : Control of our borders We were told we must Brexit to to control the flow of trade and people across our borders. The Brexit twats are now furiously denying there will be any controls at all on the one border we share with the EU. Subject : Letaposs spend £m on the NHS insteadThis works out to £.bn a year, but because the number is entirely wrong itaposs actually £.bn. Either way, the NHS funding gap is about £bn a year and growing.Youaposll note they didnapost say the EU costs us each p a day, letaposs spend it on the NHS instead. Subject : Brave new trade deals Secondhand bassoons, jumpers from the Faroe Isles, and selling the NHS to Donald Trump. Let us say no more about it. Subject : The will of the people This one is still occasionally mentioned, although in increasingly-quieter voices. Because the will of the people has, for the best part of two years, been solidly Remain. Leave constituencies have voted in Remain campaigners, there were more Remain than Leave MEPs elected last month, and everyone whoaposs not a blind, bonkers Tory can see Brexit has gone the way of the Norwegian blue. Today, what theyaposre not telling you is that John Major was once considered the most pathetic, grey, boring, rudderless, bastard-beset, pea maniac Prime Minister weaposve ever had. And he is now the Tory Partyaposs best hope.While Vanilla bitchslaps Marmite on the TV hustings, a man once ridiculed by the entire nation for being a middle-aged Clark Kent without the superpowers has snapped his power pants back on and declared heaposll wrestle either one of them to their political death.Stop staring at our potential PMs for a moment, asking yourselves how it is possible these two unappetisers are the best the natural party of government can offer. Marvel instead that the voice of sanity now looks and sounds a lot like an aged Mr Bean. Sir Johnaposs reputation has changed since he left Downing Street. We have since been exposed to claims that he shared bathwater, among other things, with Edwina Currie.Once upon a time that was one of the more shocking political sex scandals. It was news that made people stop eating their dinner with their fork halfway to the mouth, their eyes widening as they said: Wha  But those were more innocent times.  Major was the last Tory PM to defeat the anti-European wingnuts in his own party. In  he signed the Maastricht Treaty, the deal which helped to form the modern European Union.The fact he won that fight is the reason a more youthful Nigel Farage left the Conservative Party. It is why, a year later, UKIP was founded by an economist. And a little after that, a faction led by Farage ousted that leader on the grounds he was too intellectual.To be fair, then, this is very much Majoraposs fight. If you criticise David Cameron for running away, mild-mannered Major should be praised at least for coming back.It must be coincidence that Mad Cow Disease is coming too.   We all know proroguing Parliament, and making laws only a minority want, is undemocratic. But by threatening a judicial review, Major has exposed the fact itaposs un-Tory, too.No patriot should seek to destroy civil institutions that work just fine. No democrat should hold the people to an opinion they no longer hold. And no Tory should f*** business. Prostitutes, pigs, secretaries - these are all, sadly, expected. Perhaps even Edwina, in extremis. But Brexit means destroying Parliamentary sovereignty, promising a total lack of border control, ignoring the will of the people and wasting billions of pounds on schemes we currently enjoy with % cashback.   Boris Johnson will tell you to be optimistic about all of that. Jeremy Hunt says it must happen. Both of them are wrong. Because John Major, for all his flaws, are all the things they are not.He is a former Prime Minister. He is an election-winner. He defenestrated Margaret Thatcher. He saw off the Eurosceptics. He survived not only ridicule but the worldaposs worst Currie.And he s bearing the Brexit kryptonite - facts, democracy, the rule of law, and good old British sovereignty which says we are ruled by the Parliament, the courts, and the governments we choose.

The Labour leader confronted a floundering Theresa May on the legacy of the decision taken by the coalition government to cut access to legal aid - and introduce fees for people trying to bring a employment law case against their boss. Access to justice is vital in order to tackle burning injustices, Mr Corbyn said as her argued there were now legal aid deserts across the whole country. Speaking at the start of PMQs, he said: Many people welcomed the powerful points the Prime Minister made when she was first appointed about burning injustices in Britain. Does she agree with me that access to justice is vital in order to tackle burning injustices   Prime Minister Theresa May replied that there were many burning injustices that can be tackled in a iety of ways as she spoke of the action she had taken not just as Prime Minister, but also as Home Secretary. She said: And Iaposll give him one example, the Race Disparity Auditshines a light on inequality in public services is enabling us to put into place action that helps to ensure that people across this country whatever their background, will ensure that they have access to the public services they need. In , the government reformed the system in Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of OffendersAct with the aim of cutting spending by £m a year. Last month the EHRC warned that victims of discrimination in England and Wales were being denied justice due to the cutbacks.    Mr Corbyn said this year was the th anniversary of the Legal Aid and Advice Act, introduced by the post-war Labour government which he said gave all people access to justice not just the rich. It was, he added, an essential pillar of a welfare state and a decent society. Mr Corybn said the Tory-Lib Dem coalition slashed legal aid in  and the results are clearly very unfair. He added: The number of law centres and other not-for-profit legal aid providers has more than halved. There are now legal aid deserts across the whole country.

Across almost  solid minutes of live television he was asked repeatedlythe Ambassador should stay or go. But by our count he failed to answer the question - posed mostly by bullish host Mr Morgan -  times. Instead he gave conflicting arguments, saying at once that he respects the right of diplomats to speak freely but also that the special relationship shouldnapost be scuppered by one person. Growing visibly irritated, he said after the seventh question: Maybe, Piers, you should listen to my answer which is that the relationship is incredibly important. After the ninth time of asking he visibly stuttered before insisting there was so much more to the relationship than one person.    After the th time he said: Iaposm actually on here to talk about making sure we can get better health advice.

Eddie McIntosh has endured more than  years of anguish because of a legal wrangle over planning permission for the lavish development. And he could yet be jailed over the affair. The farming entrepreneur set up his eco retreat in rural Powys, Wales, in . His planning dispute with Powys council has so far cost the local authority £, in legal fees after a court case against Eddie held earlier this year.Eventually, it will also eventually see the farmer go to jailhe continues refusing to pay the fine he was issued, Wales Online reports.Now, the -year-old has opened up about the exhausting struggle for survival after being granted planning permission to keep his business only months after being told to tear it all down.    Eddie said: Itaposs been absolutely devastating. The amount of things Iaposve had to go through - my we and I have split, the business suffered, I lost the plot a little bit. Iaposm looking forward to getting back on track, especially considering years ago I was being nominated for best off-grid retreat and was on TV with Kevin McCloud. In  Eddie came across the -acre abandoned smallholding by accident. He had recently sold a Grade-II listed building in Gloucester and with about quarter of a million pounds behind him, he was looking to buy a lestyle in a rural setting. Driving through Powys in his motorhome, he saw an auction sign for the property and decided to buy it. His vision was to restore the land, establish a new smallholding and create an off-grid rural retreat offering education and alternative therapies for visitors. But just as his vision started taking off, it was forced to grind to a halt after planning permission was refused.    Eddie said: People look at me and think I didnapost submit planning permission in the first place but I did. I submitted it and it kept getting rejected so I piled on as much pressure on as possible. The bizarre thing is that these people never wanted to talk to me in the first place. They never discussed my project, it was only ever enforcement and legal action. In , Mellowcroft smallholding received a planning enforcement notice demanding Eddie take down everything from his treehouse home to the recycling point and classroom for visitors. The notice came only a year after his business had began to boom, and after featuring on Kevin McCloudaposs Man Made Home programme on Channel . Eddie said: It started just spiralling out of control. I have spent £, on planning applications and enforcement notices.  I wasnapost trying to hide anything, it was in the media and on my website. By , Eddieaposs planning application had been turned down and told his appeal was equally unsuccessful. Eventually, the planning inspector ruled the entrepreneur only had permission to use the site for agricultural purposes - meaning he would have to demolish the structures on the land and cease living in his home. Eddie insists he did comply with the order by the October  deadline, although he carried on living there, but thought he would be able to reuse some of the structures for agricultural purposes. He was eventually charged with  offences under the Town and Country Planning Act , all of which he denied. On February , a jury found him guilty of all charges following a four-day trial at Merthyr Crown Court. He was fined £ and told once more to stop living on the site - and remove all structures.    Eddie said: I tried to represent myself and that went wrong but couldnapost get legal aid. I am not going to pay the fine, I canapost pay the fine so I have to do the  days [in prison]. Iaposm not paying the costs on the moral principle that there was no charge to answer in the first place. Last Thursday, five months after Eddieaposs appearance in court, the Mellowcroft smallholding went up in front of the Powys Council Planning Committee one last time. On this occasion, it was for retrospective planning permission for agricultural purposes only. Perhaps unexpectedly, the application for the existing welfare cabin, silver birch sap production and storage building, farm office, storage shed and hut was granted - meaning Eddie will no longer have to tear down the structures that he lost his fight in court for. In total, a freedom of information request revealed Powys County Councilaposs legal costs to bring the matter to court mounted to £, - along with the £, it had previously cost them in enforcement action. Eddie said: Itaposs unbelievable to think [the council] have spent £, and itaposs just come to nothing.  It seems like a ludicrous farce really.

The Duchess of Sussex has been involved in a media storm after it emerged people had been asked not to take pictures - even though she was sitting in a packed stand and the game was being broadcast live on TV. Her protection officers told people she was there in a private capacity, watching her friend Serena Williams rather than on official royal duties.Many critics have hit out at Meghan for the demand, labelling her childish and paranoid. But a palace source has now said: “It’s entirely unfair to say the Duchess was behind the request.    “Her protection officer was simply doing his job and the Duchess is only too happy to meet well wishers and members of the public when she is out and about. “After the match she met and greeted several spectators and thoroughly enjoyed he experience as well as seeing her friend Serena Williams won her match at Wimbledon.” During the visit Meghan also stopped and spoke to some fans, including a little boy sitting nearby.   A source at the All England Club has told The Times that Meghan was a nightmare and organising the visit had been dficult .  There were also reports that Meghan wasnapost invited into the Royal Box as she was wearing jeans, however this is said not to be the case.  The source told the newspaper: She wanted to come incognito but there was problems. They couldnapost invite her into the royal box because was wearing jeans but that didnapost really matter because all she wanted to do was come and watch Serena.     Another added: It was a nightmare, she was a nightmare.  The source also claims that Meghan made a masive faux pas by going to see her friend Serena but not staying to watch Andy Murray afterwards.  They said: Andy Murray was on Court  afterwards and it was a massive faux pas not to watch a Brit when she is signed up to the royal family.  However Meghan went to see Serena as a private engagement as the two women have been friends for years, meeting years before the Duchess married into the royal family.

Video shows the festival goers wreaking havoc on the three-and-a half-hour flight - which was delayed because cabin crew struggled to control the rowdy hoard even before take off. But stewards did not see the funny side and were forced to call police to meet the revellers at the airport.

Later he can be seen passed out in his seat, while his pals continue to yell and scream. Aneta and her partner said almost the entire flight was filled with people going to the festival - billed as the holiday for hard dance lovers. She said many of the festival goers ignored the fasten seatbelts signs and were shouting at other members of the group sat many rows of seats away during the safety talk.    She described it as like being in a nightclub without the music and said three men were arrested by police in Croatia once the plane landed. Support service manager Aneta, from Leeds, was sat right in the middle of the group travelling to Croatia for a two week holiday. “It was like being in a jungle with wild animals”, she said. “It was hell on earth. It was the worst flight of my le. It was absolutely appalling.    “The only way I can describe it is like being in a nightclub without the music ,ft above the ground. “They were shouting, chanting and the crew could not calm them down. “They were uncontrollable. No one could calm them down. It was completely unacceptable. All of them were drunk. The cabin crew threatened to throw them off several times.  “They were basically having a party on the plane. They were animals. “It was obvious they were drunk when they boarded the plane. No one was allowed to buy alcohol for the whole flight because they were so drunk. “It was unacceptable. The police came on when we landed before anyone was allowed to get off. “Three of them were taken away. They were being arrested. “It was a horrible experience.”  Aneta said the group appeared to be drunk even before they boarded the plane which took off an hour late, on Saturday. They could be seen stumbling around, riding around on suitcases and drinking in airport bars at Manchester Airport, she said. But everyone was allowed to board the plane, which was delayed as cabin crew battled to explain important safety information to the festival-goers. The “disgustingly drunk” Brits were travelling to Zabar for the Hard Island festival, at Zrce Beach, on the west coast. Hard Island Festival, which started on Friday, is billed as ‘The holiday for hard dance lovers’ and runs until Thursday.

Tragic Paige was stabbed repeatedly by twisted killer John Leathem at a deli in Clydebank in March . Pamela, , who has set up a charity in Paige’s memory, told the Daily Record: “The messages are absolutely vile and what makes it worse is the fact that it was set up using my daughter’s name.    “They were sent to our charity page and I was shocked and horried at the content. “I just can’t understand why someone would want to do something so awful and use pictures of my children with horrendous messages across them. “Every day of our lives, we have to deal with losing Paige and people who do this type of thing should think of the pain and hurt it causes grieving families. “To hide behind a computer and send abuse of this kind is just callous, cruel and unacceptable.”    Pamela, also mum to Andrew, , Peyton, seven, and three-year-old Lucas, is now calling for tougher laws to unmask and trace online trolls. The Snapchat messages, too graphic to publish in full, target each of the children saying they should “kill themselves when they are older”, “get run over by a bus” and “be raped and murdered”. They also mock Paige’s brutal death. Pamela, from Bishopbriggs, Glasgow, said: “We reported it to police straight away and have been told they are investigating to try to discover who is behind the messages. “I just hope these trolls are never in a position where they lose someone they love the way I did. There’s no need to target families who are already going through so much. These people need to realise the impact they have and the damage they cause.  “It’s not only happening to us but to other people too and it has to stop. There needs to be strict laws against this type of behaviour introduced. “It should be an offence punishable with the full force of the law. “There have to be better ways of protecting victims of crime and their families and holding these trolls to account.”After burying her daughter and seeing twisted Leathem jailed for a minimum of  years, Pamela is determined to help others who have been robbed of a child. She set up Paige’s Promise, a charity offering self-defence classes, grief counselling and short breaks for bereaved families. She added: “Paige was always thinking of others and she would be proud her charity is helping people. We want her memory to live on. By doing this we can help to make a dference in the lives of people who need help after the loss of a loved one. “We’ve almost finished a memorial garden for Paige and it’s looking great. It’s somewhere we can go and think of the good times we had together. It’s a very peaceful place. “We are also planning more events over the next few months, one in particular that will help men struggling to deal with grief and loss.” "},{"url":null,"title":"spooked bull tramples handler after","story":"NewsSpooked bull tramples handler after winning prize at Great Yorkshire ShowThe handler suffered non-serious head injuries during the incident at The Great Yorkshire ShowShareCommentsByElaine McCahillDeputy News Editor:,  JUL NewsA prize-winning bull trampled its handler after becoming spooked at the Great Yorkshire Show \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPictures show the terrying moment an animal handler was trampled by a prize-winning bull.

When Sarah ed to her car, rather than finding a hefty parking ticket she discovered a hand-written note from staff at the North West Private Ambulance Liaison Service , Lancs Live reported.    It said they had sweet talked the traffic warden into not giving her a ticket.

Catherine Brown had booked a weekend break for her husbandaposs birthday at The Fleece Hotel, in Cirencester.She claims that she called before the visit to let them know she had a guide dog to assist her day-to-day, and says she was told this not a problem, Gloucestershire Live reports.But on their first night in the hotel in December last year, Catherine claims she was physically barred from entering the dining room - because somebody in there may be allergic to dogs.    Instead, Catherine was told she could eat in the seated area leading into the restaurant, or the packed bar area - both of which, she said, were too dimly lit for her poor sight. Catherine, from Glastonbury, Somerset, said: I was physically barred from entering the dining room. A very tall man stood in front of me and said I wasn’t allowed in as somebody in there may have been allergic to dogs. She said the area leading into the restaurant was dimly-lit with candles, and added: I told them that due to the poor light levels I would be unable to see my food clearly. I was then told that I could eat in the bar area, but it was heaving with people. There was also low lighting in there, so I couldn’t see what was on my plate. I ended up in tears, it was a very upsetting experience. She claims that hotel staff had seen her guide dog, Ruby, when she checked in earlier that day and nothing was said.    Staff also told my husband that they would reserve a table for us for breakfast the following morning, outside the dining room. In the end we ate where for the rest of our stay, we only used the hotel as a place to sleep. Catherine said she spoke to the manager and reminded of him of his obligations due to the Disability Act . Phil Mehrtens, general manager at The Fleece says that dogs are not allowed in that area of the restaurant, because there are some people with allergies. He said: We were really disappointed that the lady in question was not happy with her stay with us, particularly as we didn’t find that out until after she checked out. The Fleece is a beautul place to stay and eat with many dferent areas to enjoy food and drink. There is one particular section which we don’t allow dogs in because there are some people with allergies and others who really don’t like dogs. But this has never been an issue previously because there are so many dferent spaces within our inn and it’s exactly the same menu and service standards on offer. However, after the lady who is partially sighted wrote to us with her experiences, we took on board her comments. We have amended some of our operations so that this doesn’t happen again, and invited her back so she could have a much more positive stay.

Everyone sympathised with single mother Dee Dee Blanchard, who spent every moment caring for Gypsy Rose, a teenager with “the mental capacity of a seven-year-old”.Confined to a wheelchair almost her entire le, her daughter suffered from leukaemia , asthma, muscular dystrophy, learning dficulties and paraplegia, according to Dee Dee.She also had to be fed through a tube after having her saliva glands removed and her teeth fall out from seizure medications. Whenever they went out, the mother had to carry her oxygen tank and feeding tube.    Andthat weren’t enough suffering, the family had been left with nothing after Hurricane Katrina, from which the mother and daughter had barely escaped with their lives. Their ordeal, though, had led to an outpouring of support from their community of Springfield, Missouri, charities and celebrities. Habitat for Humanity built them a house with a special wheelchair ramp, while the Make-A-Wish Foundation sent them on an all-expenses-paid trip to Disney World. Country music star Miranda Lambert visited them at their home and, moved by their plight, gave them £, from her personal account. And they met Lord of the Rings actor Elijah Wood, posing with him for a photo. But appearances weren’t what they seemed. The horrying true crime story has now been told in Huluaposs The Act, starring Joey King and Patricia Arquette.    On June , , sherf’s deputies entered Dee Dee’s home and found the motheraposs body, facedown in a pool of blood from stab wounds inflicted several days earlier.Neighbours had called police after someone hacked into the mother’s Facebook account, and wrote: “That bitch is dead”.More alarming, there was no sign of her daughter, leading to a belief Gypsy Rose had been abducted by her mother’s murderer. The medications she needed to stay alive were found still in the house and a huge manhunt was launched. Officers were at first relieved to find Gypsy Rose in a hotel with her boyfriend Nicholas Godejohn, who she had met online. But what they discovered next was so bizarre it was even more shocking and grotesque than the idea that someone had murdered a loving mother and snatched her severely handicapped daughter. Gypsy Rose wasn’t a child at all but a -year-old adult. And she had never been sick, disabled or confined to a wheelchair. In fact, once her boyfriend had butchered her mother, she had simply stood up from her wheelchair and run out the house with him.  It was actually the mother, not her daughter, who was sick it emerged. Dee Dee suffered from a condition called Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy , a mental disorder where a parent fabricates or induces a person under their care to obtain sympathy or attention. She had been making her daughter pass herself off as younger, and pretend to be disabled and chronically ill, giving her medication she didn’t need and subjecting her to unnecessary surgery, and controlling her through physical and psychological abuse. The incredible story has now been turned into a true crime mini-series, The Act, starring Patricia Arquette and Joey King. In fact, Gypsy Rose had been trying to escape her abusive, controlling mother for years. Four years earlier, in , she ran away, fleeing from the hospital to a friend’s house. But Dee Dee tracked her down and punished her, taking away her phone, smashing her computer and hitting her with coat hangers.  In a  interview, she said: There are certain illnesses that I knew I didnapost have. I knew that I didnapost need the feeding tube. I knew that I could eat. I knew that I could walk. But I did believe my mother when she said I had leukemia. Gypsy Rose also told police her mother would shave her head to make her look like a chemotherapy patient and convinced medics to remove her saliva glands by using an anaesthetic to numb her gums and make her drool before doctor visits. Tubes were also implanted in her ears to control the ear infections her mother claimed she had. She also claimed thatshe ever said something while in public which showed she was not really sick or mentally impaired, Dee Dee would give her a very tight squeeze - then when the two were alone, would strike her with her hands or a coat hanger. Then, in , she started a secret romance with Nicholas Godejohn, who was six years her senior, after meeting on a Christian dating site.  Soon, they were planning their wedding and naming their future children. Most importantly, Gypsy Rose saw in Godejohn an escape from her controlling mother. In , she convinced her internet boyfriend to murder her mother so they could be together. “I wanted to be free of her hold on me,” she told his trial in . Godejohn drove to Springfield, arriving while Gypsy Rose and her mother were away at a doctors’ appointment. After they had ed and Dee Dee had gone to sleep, she let him into the house, handing him duct tape, gloves and a kne, before hiding in the bathroom and covering her ears so she would not have to hear her mother screaming as he stabbed her to death. Then, they fled to Godejohn’s house is Big Bend, Winconsin, where police caught up to them, and the real specics of the case were unraveled.  In , Gypsy Rose was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to  years in prison. According to her loved ones, Gypsy Rose is actually thriving in prison. Kristy Blanchard, Gypsy Roseaposs stepmother, said in : Despite everything, she still tells me that sheaposs happier now than with her mom. And thatshe had a choice to either be in jail, or back with her mom, she would rather be in jail. In another interview from prison earlier this year she said she felt “like a prisoner” before her mother was killed. She said: “The prison that I was living in before, with my mom, itaposs, like, I couldnapost walk. I couldnapost eat. I couldnapost have friends. I couldnapost go outside, you know, and play with friends or anything.

But the first man to set foot on the moon -  years ago this month - was also notoriously shy and, once back on Earth, lived a reclusive le out of the spotlight, rarely speaking about the mission, even with friends and family. Even photos taken from the surface of the moon only show his fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin, as it was Armstrong who took them and preferred to stay behind the camera. Armstrong died aged  in  but here, in the first of two parts, we reveal the build-up to and drama of the moon landings in his own words...    We were trailing. The Soviet Union had successfully put firstly an articial satellite into space, and secondly, put a man into orbit around the Earth. We had put only one flight, Alan Shepard, on a short -minute suborbital flight of about a hundred miles altitude and back down into the ocean. We’d never had a person in orbit, and now the President was challenging us to go to the moon. The gap between a -minute up and down flight and going to the moon was something that was almost beyond belief technically. But Nasa had identied the lunar landing as perhaps the only way we could catch up with the Soviet Union. And the challenge was enormous.    The first Apollo space craft was on a pre-flight test with the crew in the module atop the rocket on the pad at Cape Canaveral. A spark ignited some of the flammable material in the cockpit. The hatch was an inward opening hatch that the crew was unable to quickly open, and the crew was killed in the fire. It was a tragedy, and it was going to take us a long time to recover from that. The second flight was an eleven day flight to make sure that the command module had systems that would run for theof the lunar mission. That worked well. They decided they would take the next flight - Apollo  - on the big Saturn rocket, and not only fly it with humans on it but also take it around the moon. It was an enormously bold decision, but that moved our programme along a lot further. A few days later the boss called me and said, “Would you take the third flight down the road, Apollo  ” A month before the launch of Apollo  we decided we were confident enough that we could try an attempt a descent to the surface.    I thought we had a % chance of getting back down to earth on that flight, but only a   chance of making a successful landing on the first attempt. I never allowed myself the luxury of dreaming of being the team which would step foot on the moon. On the day of the launch, there was a certain relaxed atmosphere. You’re thinking, “We’ll get down to two minutes and then they’ll call a hold, then they’ll cancel the flight then we’ll go another day, so don’t get too excited here about this”. So, actually, when you actually lt off, it’s really a big surprise. The noise at lt off from the pad is extremely loud, you get not only the noise of the engine but the reflected noise that’s coming up off the ground. Until you fly out of that reflection after about  seconds it’s very dficult to hear anything, even with our special helmets and earphones on.    It’s a very shaky ride especially in that particular rocket, the Saturn , a , tonne machine with an energy enough to lt it off the pad. The second and third stages are just as smooth as the first stage is shaky. It was a striking event, leaving the planet and realising that there was no logical reason that you were ever going to fall back to that planet at some point. It was a slowly changing panorama as you went from just the horizon to a large arc, to a larger and larger arc, and finally to a whole sphere. The Earth is quite beautul from space. It looks quite small and quite remote, but it’s very blue and covered in white lace, the clouds, and the continents are very clearly seen. Greenland stood out, just as it doesn’t on the globe in your library, all white. Africa was quite visible, and we could see sun glint off a lake. There were a just thousand things to worry about in the final descent to the moon. It was hardest for the systems, it was hardest for the crew. It was the thing I most worried about, because it was so dficult. The unknowns were rampant. And in the middle of the descent our computer complained at us that it was having a problem. We had gone that far and we wanted to land.    We were getting good velocities and good altitudes. The navigation was working fine. There were no anomalies other than the fact that the computer was saying, ‘Hey, I’ve got a problem’. My inclination was to keep going ahead as long as everything looked like it was fine. So we continued on toward the landing site, but then the computer showed us where it intended to land and it was a very bad location. It was on the side of a large crater, about  metres in diameter with very steep slopes covered with very large boulders, not a good place to land at all. So I took over manually and flew it like a helicopter, out to the west, a smoother area with not so many rocks. We started losing visibility when we got a little below  feet. We starting picking up dust, and not just normal dust clouds like we would experience on Earth. This sheet of moving dust obscured the surface almost completely. This very fast, almost horizontally moving sheet of dust did not billow up at all. It just moved out and away in a straight radial sheet. The visibility continued to decrease as we got lower. I was able to get it down there safely before we ran out of fuel - we had about  seconds of fuel left. After landing we took a handshake - “Congratulations, we made it this far”. But there was a lot of work to do at that point, and we couldn’t luxuriate on those feelings. “Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” That was the signature line for achieving the presidential goal that we had been working on for a decade, and in our view that was a very important statement. Days: To The Moon And Back is on Wednesday  July on BBC at pmApollo aposs Key Mission Moments LaunchApollo  was the most powerful rocket to fly successfully. The five F engines produced . million pounds of thrust – the equivalent of  F- fighter jets. The crew were accelerated to almost ,mph. Seeing the eclipseOn the fourth day, as Apollo  neared the Moon, it entered its shadow and got their first close up views of the Moon’s surface and the spectacle of a solar eclipse. Entering lunar orbitTo enter lunar orbit, the crew of Apollo  had to slow the craft by around ,mph by burning their engine. The timing was critical an overburn of just a matter of seconds might slow the Command Module enough to crash it. Seeing the far side of the moonAs the crew began to orbit the Moon they became some of the first people to see its far side. Only the crews of the earlier, pathfinder missions, Apollo  and Apollo  missions had been there before them. Moon LandingAs Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were making their descent to the Moon’s surface, they lost radio contact with mission control. They had become so low on fuel they came within less than a minute from having to abort the mission. The lunar module touched down safely but it was four miles downrange from the planned site. MoonwalkToward the end of his historic moonwalk, Armstrong’s heart rate shot up to an alarming  beats per minute. Not wanting to alert the world to the problem, mission control made a disguised request for Neil to slow down by checking equipment. The broken switchAldrin and Armstrong might have been stranded on the Moon. They discovered that one of the switches controlling the engine had broken off. Eventually, Buzz Aldrin armed the switch with a felt-tipped pen. Re-entry to Earth’s atmosphereThe astronauts relied on Earth’s atmosphere to slow them down on the trip home. But the angle at which they entered was critical with a margin of less than three degrees.

We constantly have a collecting can in the practice.“I am also hoping to do a sky e in the future.“In total we have so far raised £ but donations are still coming in which is fantastic.“I had hoped to raise £.”Orkambi is the second drug to be licensed for use in people with cystic fibrosis, the first was Kalydeco.The medication is not currently available on the NHS with the Cystic Fibrosis Trust currently campaigning to ensure the drugs reach the people who need them.However, the medication cannot help everyone with cystic fibrosis and can only help those with specic mutations of the condition.Lisa added: “Orkambi will not help Robbie as he has a rare mutation and the most common, both of which can’t be helped by Orkambi, so I feel the more money raised to go towards research which will help everyone who suffers is paramount in order to help him.”Although to some an abseil would be extremely daunting, Lisa said she really enjoyed herself.“I loved every moment of it, it was very exciting.“It was amazing at the top and we could spot all of our supporters easily as they were all in cystic fibrosis yellow!“I was watching Robbie all the way down as he was cheering us on.”Lisa and Brad were joined by  other daredevils who were raising money for cystic fibrosis and luckily the skies were clear for the venture over the River Forth."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1f2c032317a7.06468979-453x564.jpg ","title":"benjamin siegrist looking to make history as he aims for top flight place","story":"Benjamin Siegrist was flattered to be linked with a move to the English Championship over the summer.But other than to the Premiership with Dundee United, the Swiss goalkeeper isn’t planning of going anywhere for quite some time.Siegrist’s performances in the second half of last season, culminating in a string of five-star displays during the promotion play-offs, saw him watched by Nottingham Forest.That was nice to hear as he enjoyed a few weeks off last month but, as he focuses on the coming season with the Tangerines, fans will be delighted to learn it’s not turned his head.“It was nice but it just proved the point to me I know what I can do and I know where the standards lie,” he said.“I am more than happy here. I know what I have here and I work well with the staff.“I know how big a club this is and I am really happy to be here.“And what is important for me is I want to be one of those players who go in the history books of this club and say he was one who got promotion for the team.“I want to improve and learn every week. As a team I think we got better last season as the games continued and I think I got better as a goalkeeper.“We want to keep doing that this year and,we do, we will get back to where we want to be.“Everybody knows where this club belongs and everybody wants to be part of achieving that ultimate goal of getting promoted.“That’s a big point of incentive and motivation for all the players.”Siegrist admits a bonus for him as he ed to work last week was teaming up again in training with fellow-goalie Deniz Mehmet.He was at United until January and has ed with a view to signing up again.“We crossed paths before when we were younger, at international tournaments with Switzerland and Turkey.“Coming from clubs down south we also faced each other. We are competing for the same place but there is always the goalkeepers’ union that means we stick together and it is nice to be working every day with someone you like.”Very much one for looking forward, Siegrist refuses to dwell too long on the disappointing end to last term that saw United again miss out on promotion in the play-offs.And when he does look back, he takes the positives.“I think what happened last year is part of our motivation for this year but I don’t want to speak too much about it because we start from zero again for a new season.“You do every year. In terms of experience it is good that we have had big games, big occasions together and that will help us.“It is like money in the bank but this season is about doing it consistently and picking up points over the whole of the year.”Tonight sees the start of a busy weekend when the entire squad will be involved in a friendly at Brechin before heading for Dumbarton tomorrow to do it all again.Two games in less than  hours may seem unusual but, for Siegrist, it will be the perfect way to prepare for the start of the competitive action in the Betfred Cup at Hearts next week.“So far as fitness goes we are good and game time is the most valuable time you have as a player,” he added.“You can train all week butyou don’t have a game at the end of it you are not bringing everything you’ve worked on together.“It is good to have as many games as we can so we are looking forward to these two games.“There is a lot more to football than passing and running, so game time is the most valuable part of pre-season.”"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-do-you-recognise-any-of-these-old-photographs-of-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-how-many-of-these-old-photos-of-glasgow-do-you-remember","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-moment-angus-woman-zoe-archibald-gets-stuck-in-toy-car","story":"THIS is the hilarious moment a Scotswoman got stuck in a childrens toy car -

This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

from the UK Government, the Scottish Government and five councils that represent the region were in Peebles on Monday to sign the Heads of Terms for investment of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive economic challenges.ldquoIt works out at around poundm a year over ten years for the whole of the south of Scotland which is quite modest.ldquoHowever, it will bring some badly needed investment into projects that could make a real dference to the local

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Davies, who had a -year unimpeachable work record, believed that she had been discriminated against when dismissed for ldquogross misconduct, when in fact she was suffering debilitating physical and mental problems because of severe menopausal symptoms.Already I can hear sniggering in the back row. The word menopause often has that effect. As anyone who has gone through it knows, it is the condition whose name nobody dares speak for fear of mockery or revulsion. Periods used to be taboo, but thanks to enlightened education, they are fast losing their power to humiliate. Not so the m-word. While itrsquos okay to arrive in the office nursing a humdinger of a hangover, to admit to the Grayrsquos Medical Dictionary of complaints that the middle-aged woman endures is like raising a flag of shame. Not that we need any flag. When in its grip, some of us emit as much steam as the Hogwartrsquos Express.Thanks to the courage of Ms Davies and her lawyer Kate Wyatt, we should get used to hearing more about the menopause, and to wiping the smile off sniggerersrsquo faces. Despite the hurdles they faced, they won their case. Awarding the complainant pound, compensation for lost pay, and pound for ldquoinjury to feelings, the judgement also said Ms Davies should be given her job back.So what , you might be thinking. Itrsquos hardly as dramatic a step in the fight for womenrsquos equality as Wade v Roe, or the recently expanded definition of what constitutes domestic violence. In fact it is every bit as revolutionary. Possibly even more so, since almost every woman will go through it. By proving that menopausal symptoms can have as deleterious effect on a personrsquos well-being and ability toas an illness or disability, this landmark case will go down in legal history as ndash forgive the phrase ndash a red-letter day for womenrsquos rights.In Daviesrsquos instance, she had to cope with very heavy bleeding, anxiety and loss of memory. To hold down a job while contending with all this must be hard. All women will sympathise. Even those who sailed through the Change of Le, as our grandmothers called it, know that itrsquos not always easy. It can last a decade or more, bringing with it a smorgasbrod of side-effects. Lost names, sentences that cannot be finished, tasks left undone and forgotten are all part of the mental fog that descends asyoursquore scaling the Matterhorn. There can be sudden catastrophic loss of confidence, when ordinary tasks seem scary. Add to these meteoric mood swings and general aches and pains, and there are surprisingly few days when you feel like your real self.It doesnrsquot help that you wake in the small hours thinking yoursquove left the electric blanket on high, only to discover itrsquos you whorsquos imitating a kettle.

You could be in ice-bound Archangel, but your body will suddenly find itself near the Mediterranean, rustling up a Turkish bath up for you to enjoy.Read more: Why age isnrsquot a barrier to power in our youth-driven societyPerhaps the crimson face that afflicts women of a certain age is naturersquos way of making us visible. As almost all over-s know, by this point we have become wallpaper. Itrsquos hard catching the waiterrsquos eye, let alone hailing a taxi at rush hour. This is not necessarily bad. With invisibility comes power of a dferent sort, as Miss Marple knew to her advantage. But the fluster that the menopause creates brings attention of the wrong kind, a self-perpetuating vortex of public mortication that can only be cured by half an hour in a wind tunnel.It sounds comic, but itrsquos no joke. Especially not when you consider the escalating number of women working into their fties and beyond. Indeed,you were a conspiracy theorist, yoursquod think the cosmos was enjoying a grand jest at our expense. First, women need time off work to have, and raise, children. As a result, they risk slipping down the career ladder. Once back in harness, they scrabble to catch up. Yet no matter how much effort they put in, therersquos no escaping the awareness that therersquos little chance of fully retrieving the time and status they have lost.Then, just when a measure of equilibrium has been reached, the menopause looms. At the very age when we have acquired experience, confidence and perspective, when childcare days are over, and we are eager to throw ourselves into work, hormones step up a gear. Whether the job is challenging or routine, whether the menopause is a mere blip or is so debilitating it represents a serious intermission in normal service, it makes an impact, and never in a good way.With an ageing population and the state pension fast receding, a prodigious number of women will be in work in advanced middle-age. As they navigate this troublesome stage, they need to know their bosses and colleagues are not sitting in judgement.Now that one case of mistreatment has been brought to book, every employer should be conscious that staff going through the menopause need more kindness and respect than ever. If the stigma and embarrassment of a wholly natural physical transition can be eased, then employees are likely to repay this solicitude with years of loyal service. As those women who have passed through the night sweats, hot flushes and all the rest often say, happy days lie just around the corner. Theyrsquore like canoeists whorsquove shot the rapids, and found themselves in calmer waters at last."},{"url":null,"title":"wrong-devolve-immigration-policies","story":"True, the SNP policy on immigration dfers from that advanced by most political parties, in that it wants more of it, rather than to reduce it. It deserves credit for this, because itrsquos not an especially popular stance, and therersquos some evidence that it may cost it votes. But on demographic and economic grounds and, for the most part, general principles, the case for increasing immigration is overwhelming, because the arithmetic is pretty well indisputable.By contrast, the argument that mass immigration is overwhelming the native population, or national characteristics, social norms or the like is nebulous, tricky to demonstrate andfaintly disreputable,not downright racist. Indeed, until just a few years ago, most political parties simply ignored or aggressively disputed such cultural anxieties, though examples of social breakdown in places such as Govanhill, or of schools where the majority of pupils do not have English as a first language, indicate that those concerns are far from illusory.Nonetheless, such worries may be overstated, manipulated by populist politicians, or simply misdirected ndash with the failures being policy, or resource allocation, or misguided cultural relativism, rather than some essential feature of immigration. Theyrsquore at any rate not insurmountable polling in January suggested that, since the Brexit vote, the UK electoratersquos attitude towards migration has become more positive, with  per cent thinking its impact positive and only  per cent negative ndash almost exactly the reverse of the figures in June .This applies to Leave and Remain voters perhaps because Leave votersbelieve the Westminster Government will soon have control, or perhaps because their aim was always control itself rather than blanket opposition to immigration. The next Prime Minister will almost certainly ditch the blinkeredtarget figures that Theresa May so stupidly clung to, and voters seem perfectly relaxed about the prospect.But that distinction between control and numbers is the reason why devolution of immigration, like freedom of movement within the EU, is not really an option while Scotland remains within the UK, or for that matter, within the EU.The SNP is right to point to an impending demographic crisis in paying for pensions, welfare services and care for the sick and elderly, because the Scottish birthrate is at its lowest for  years, and the population is expected to grow by just . per cent by , considerably less than comparable EU countries.The Scottish Governmentrsquos also right that immigrants are a net economic boon the gain in tax revenue and productivity is so much more than the costs that itrsquos evidentially impossible to dispute, even for those who argue that wage suppression in the lowest-paid jobs, or costs in education, health and housing are signicant . Of course, Holyrood could try spending less, or attracting people from where in the UK with lower tax rates, butitrsquos not prepared to do that, immigration is one solution to the black hole in the budget.But you canrsquot realistically determine your own immigration policy while part of a larger union, whether itrsquos the EU or the UK, evenScotlandrsquos current concern is that Brexit may reduce the number of migrants. For now, anyone from any EU country can still set up in any other oneand anyone admitted to the UK can settle anywhere within it. There are forms of devolution that allow some incentives within that free movement regional subsidies to encourage industries or housing, or to promote population growth .The opposite can be done, by restricting access to aspects of welfare or services, although to a limited degree within EU rules. The UK, under Tony Blairrsquos government, chose not to apply them, but Scotland does apply some restrictions: for example, theof time you must be resident to qualy for university tuition ndash something which currently disqualies only rUK applicants.In fact, at the moment, Scottish Government spending priorities and taxation levels provide a disincentive for those of working age, particularly higher earners, and a strong incentive for students and retirees .I share Holyroodrsquos favourable view of immigration, and of its economic benefits ndash perhaps even its economic necessity ndash but itrsquos possible to provide more general incentives in areas that are already devolved. And it would be a good thing for the UK to rethink income qualications and skills requirements whatrsquos regarded as suitable for south-east England doesnrsquot necessarily fit the Highlands and Islands.To devolve immigration policy in its entirety, however, requires the erection of distinctions and controls between territories that dfer it is more or less a de facto declaration of full independence. A good reason, naturally, for the SNP to be keen on it, but a fairly obvious reason for it to remain a reserved power while the Union exists."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-rude-awakening-lunar-lines-tannoy-tricks","story":"MY goodness, the weather took a turn for the worse.

One submarine is always on patrol.ldquoStep two is removal of the keys and the triggers which would then be secured in a safe place on land.ldquoStep three is to disable the missiles.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amALL four of the German High Seas Fleet wrecks which had been put up for auction on eBay, have been sold for a total price of £,, the man behind the sale has confirmed.

Our submission is that evidence may not have been complete or fully accurate.Senior coroner for North WalesJohn Gittins rejected the application and said it was ldquotactical and designed to get round a previously rejected application to call Mr Shottonrsquos statement.An appeal against the coronerrsquos earlier ruling not to allow that evidence, which included text messages relating to the behaviour of Mr Sargeant, was rejected by the High Court earlier this year.Mr Gittins said: ldquoCalling the witness is a further bite of that same cherry. The court heard Mrs Sargeant was only aware of one anonymous letter sent to her about her husband in , alleging he was not fit to be around women.But Ms McGahey said evidence from Mr Shotton suggested another letter had been received.In a statement, Mr Shotton said in early  he had been told by fellow Labour councillor Bernie Attridge that Mr Sargeant had received an anonymous letter making allegations about him being seen in a pub beer garden with a woman.Mr Shotton also said an alleged incident involving Mr Sargeant had occurred at the evening reception of his wedding, although he said he did not witness it.Ms McGahey said the evidence could be key to the ldquocredibility and reliability of Mrs Sargeantrsquos evidence and could provide information about what ldquoincidents or allegations may have been preying or were preying on Mr Sargeantrsquos mind when he took his own le.Leslie Thomas QC, representing Mrs Sargeant and her son Jack, said Mr Shottonrsquos evidence was made up of rumour.He said: ldquoThe deceased person is not here to defend themselves. This is not a trial, remember there has been no investigation into these rumours and suspicion.On Tuesday, Mrs Sargeant told the hearing at Ruthin County Hall that her husband had been ldquoshell-shocked by the allegations and she believed him ldquo% when he denied them.Mr Gittins said: ldquoThis is not a trial, having reviewed the statement of Aaron Shotton and evidence he might be able to give, there is nothing in it that mentions that Mrs Sargeant had knowledge, which she denied yesterday.He said the application was ldquooutside the scope of the inquest and ldquoopportunistic.Gordon Nardell QC, a lawyer for the Labour Party, gave a statement to the inquest setting out reviews of policies and procedures.He said: ldquoThe Labour Party has learned lessons around Carl Sargeantrsquos tragic death.Mr Gittins told the court he no longer needed to hear evidence from Mr Sargeantrsquos son Jack, who had been due to be called on Thursday.He rejected an application by the media to disclose the text messages between Mr Attridge and Mr Shotton which had been referred to in legal arguments.The court was adjourned until midday on Thursday when the coroner was expected tohis judgment.copy -.

Her declaration comes after Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt claimed the Scottish Government was not making adequate preparations for a no-deal scenario.Former first minister Jack McConnell also warned relations between civil servants in Edinburgh and London had been hit by growing isions as a result of enhanced devolution. The claims are made in a new collection of essays published by the Smith Institute think tank today.Ms Sturgeon said the civil service in Scotland has “often worked well” with the UK-wide civil service despite “inevitable tensions”.But she said: “Our experiences have been mixed here, however.“The Scottish Government has also had to work with the UK government on the aftermath of the  referendum on leaving the EU.“The UK government has routinely deprived Scottish Government civil servants of important information – for example, on preparations for a no-deal Brexit – which I would expect to be made available. This is perhaps a reminder that, regardless of the professionalism and goodwill of civil servants, clear leadership from ministers is still absolutely essentialgovernment is toeffectively.”It is feared a no-deal Brexit could cost up to , jobs north of the Border. Ms Sturgeon has warned the Scottish Government will not be able to fully mitigate the impact.SNP ministers are concerned about a lack of information in key logistical areas such as how much ferry capacity will be available after exiting the EU and on what routes they will run. It is also not known what goods will be classed as “priority” and what arrangements will be made for Scottish needs, including the particular challenges of rural areas. It is also not known whether food exports can be integrated with imports, which would allow Scots goods to be shipped on the “outbound” journey.Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the Scottish Government was not doing enough to prepare for a no-deal scenario during a visit to Scotland last week, but declined to specy particular areas of concern.Lord McConnell says it is time to “refresh and renew a battered civil service”. He warns enhanced devolution has led to a freeze in relations between civil servants north and south of the Border.“Internally within the UK, respect for the autonomy of the devolved nations and the relationship between their ministers and civil servants leads to a lack of interchange now that is iding the practical experience of dferent levels of government,” he adds.“To tackle this, regular secondments and interchange should take place between UK departments and departments reporting to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast.“Top level civil servants in London, and in the devolved administrations, should have spent some of their career working at the other level, understanding the systems and dynamics at play there and understanding the relationships from both sides.” The former first minister warns there is a need for the civil service in the UK to be strengthened.“There are too many instances of covering up for ministers or colleagues and in these times of identity politics, where nationalism and patriotism can become confused, too many stories arise of promotions based on political loyalties,” he says.The collection of essays has been published in an attempt to “bring clarity” to the debate about the challenges of delivering an impartial civil service. Steve Barwick, editor of the collection and deputy director of the independent Smith Institute think tank, said it shows the “diligence and impartiality” of civil servants is respected by the vast majority of politicians.A UK Government Spokesperson said: “There are regular discussions at all levels between the UK and Scottish Government ahead of UK’s exit from the European Union to discuss the next steps in delivering Brexit in a smooth and orderly way.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

They will ask the Shetland Islands Council to declare a climate emergency, as Orkney Islands Council did earlier this year. raquoWhat an amazing turnout, thanks to everyone who participated. 👏🏻🙌🏻As long as people in power put the value of money ahead of anything then we will never cease to destroying the planet until mother nature herself decides for us. For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash..."},{"url":null,"title":"yell ferry daggri could be out of service for up to two weeks ","story":" will be taken out of service for up to a fortnight in early July in order for essential mechanical work to be done.According to Shetland Islands Council, inspections during the recent annual refit had highlighted an issue with the shaft bearings between each main engine and the propulsion thrusters.Parts were not available at that time and the vessel would now need to be taken out of service to carry out the repairs, which could take up to two weeks..Bookings and timetable on the route would operate as normal but with a reduced capacity for vehicles, the SIC said, apologising for any inconvenience caused. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th.

His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price.

It was initially withheld, officials said because it was felt disclosure would \"weaken or inhibit\" their negotiating position and given Brexit was still \"live issue\" it needed to be considered internally \"freely and frankly\".The Brexit Gateway Review was compiled by experts in the Department of Finance and assessed the Brexit preparations carried out by the Department for Agriculture and Rural Development- a key department in terms of cross-border trading in agriculture.It recommended a need for \"clear tactical and operational focus\" to prepare for the UKs departure from the EU from day one as well as a need to identy potential gaps that needed to be addressed. It suggested communication between the department in Northern Ireland and officials in London was not adequate. \"Northern Ireland officials have limited visibility of Brexit information even in areas that are critical to Northern Ireland interests,\" the review said.It went on to say as the original March Brexit deadline approached communication improved.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said the revelations showed \"the total lack of concern in London regarding the impact on people here\".“Despite the fact that the north will be hardest hit by this disastrous policy, we continue to see London’s total indference and disregard for the consequences of Brexit in Ireland.“We are being driven toward a disastrous no deal Brexit. In that eventuality the British Government needs to act in line with the Good Friday Agreement and announce a referendum to give people the option of remaining in the EU through Irish reunication.”A DAERA spokesman said it had an \"excellent working relationship\" with its colleagues in London."},{"url":null,"title":"man accused of keeping nigerian woman as domestic slave must remain in custody","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He made the comments after the government published an updated #Brexit preparedness plan @PA pic tcqpNI— Michelle DevaneJuly , “It will make it more dficult for the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement toand it will be a fundamental disruptor to the all island economy as it s today seamlessly,” he said.“There is no sugar coating of that message. For people living in border counties and in Northern Ireland, this will be really dficult.“In a no-deal scenario, while we will prevent physical infrastructure, undoubtedly the imposition of tarfs and the need to protect the integrity of the single market, to keep Ireland in the single market that we have been part of creating, will provide a disruption to the all-island trade which is something that we will all work intensively to avoid.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Tanaiste Simon Coveney Mr Coveney told the media that the “overarching theme” of the document is a stark message that there is no good news in a no-deal Brexit for Ireland, Northern Ireland or the UK.“This will be a very, very dficult issue for Ireland to deal with but this document is about mitigating where we can the negative impacts of that scenario should it unfold,” he continued.The -page document states that a crash Brexit would pose “unique and unprecedented” challenges for the UK, the EU and Ireland.The extensive report further states that a no-deal would be an exercise in damage limitation and it would also be “impossible” to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors.It also found that a no-deal Brexit will have severe negative impacts in a number of sectors and among smaller and medium-sized businesses, and it will be widely felt on a regional basis.It also warned of signicant job losses in the most exposed sectors in a no-deal scenario, with an estimated increase in unemployment of -, after the UK leaves the EU.It further said that tarfs and checks and controls on UK imports will be disruptive to trade across the Irish Sea.The report also said that the consequences of the UK crashing out of the EU could be “very damaging” for the political process in Northern Ireland.“If the institutions are not in place at the time of a no-deal Brexit, there is a risk that the UK Government might initiate a move to Direct Rule in Northern Ireland as a response to managing the sht to new post-Brexit arrangements,” the report added.“A no-deal Brexit will have profound implications for Ireland on all levels.“These implications involve severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral challenges.“Notwithstanding mitigation measures in place, potential disruption to daily le in areas such as online retail purchases from the UK, access to medicines, and medical devices, and financial services sourced from the UK.”Mr Coveney continued: “We will need to take some action somewhere in our economy to ensure that we are protecting the integrity of the products that are then going to be sold on out of Ireland but we are not going to put checks on the border or close to it.”He said Ireland needs to make sure the integrity of single market is protected and that a situation does not arise where there is an “unguarded backdoor” through Northern Ireland into the EU single market which would “in effect take Ireland out of the single market against our will”.“We as a government can’t allow that to happen and won’t allow it to happen,” he added.Mr Coveney said that, personally, he does think the UK will crash out of the EU on October .“I’m not a gambler, it’s just as well with Brexit,” he added.“It’s a very real risk now and we need to be prepared for it in a very real way.“One of the warnings I’ve given this week to businesses is that we can’t suffer from the boy who cried wolf mentality here.“We’ve had a number of occasions where we’ve been marched to the top of the hill and then all of a sudden there’s been an extension.“And anybody who assumes that somehow someone is going to pull a rabbit out of a hat between now and October I think is being very naive. People need to prepare for all Brexit outcomes.“Others have suggested that there’s some evil plan on a shelf somewhere that can be implementednecessary. There isn’t.”He said that discussions between Ireland and the European Commission are continuing.He continued: “We’re designing solutions here in very dficult circumstances with this dual responsibility we have towards peace and good relations and at the same time protecting Ireland’s economy and keeping us in the single market and customs union. And the European Commission is helping us to do that.“But we know that in the build up to October, this time it’s for real, and we will need answers to these awkward questions.”He said it was why the backstop was such a “clever solution to this dficult issue”."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Female representation within the ranks of An Garda Siochana is strong.“Women perform duty across the whole range of operational units and bureaus. Every day, the women of An Garda Siochana make a positive dference to iniduals and the communities this organisation serves across the country and further afield.”It was noted throughout the event and by the commissioner that female gardai have suffered “unacceptable, sexist and degrading” treatment while serving in the force.Minister Charlie Flanagan spoke atduring his speech about the recent case of Majella Moynihan, an unwed female gardai who was forced to give up her child against her will, and had her career halted due to the discrimination she suffered in the aftermath of having a child “outside of wedlock”.He spoke of meeting and apologising to Ms Moynihan, and that she had told him of the camaraderie she felt from some of the other female gardai during the episode.Currently, female gardai only make up % of the force but Mr Flanagan said the overhaul of the police force will work to advance gender equality.“I’m keen to ensure that state bodies like Garda Siochana are friendly workplaces for women,” he said.“An Garda Siochana is going through a time of reform, and is an attractive career, and I would encourage more women to join, and would point to the great options career-wise for women in specialisation in the security forces of the state.“It’s important in any police service that the make-up of that service is reflective of society at large, that’s why we need more women and minorities and reflective of modern day Irish society, and I know the Garda commissioner concurs with that view.”One female guard, Sergeant Nicola Brady from Dublin’s Finglas Garda station, in the Class of , was one of five women in her first station.“I have led a charmed existence in the guards, I haven’t had any negative experience, you’re paid to do a job, the lads are paid the same, you’re expected to get out and do it, you’re paid to get stuck in,” she said.“We all police the same for the most part.“In some circumstances women take a softer approach, especially in domestic situations, but not all the time.“Some people might not agree with me, but women tend to be a bit more rational and practical than men at times – but I’m sure someone will correct me on that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bmw stops uk production of engines for south africa factory due to brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He was regarded by everyone as a quiet and mild-mannered man and had never been involved in any political agitation.Newspaper reports recorded that his funeral was one of the largest the city had ever seen and was attended by an estimated , people.CAPTION: The remains of Sammy Devenny being carried past his home in William Street."},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist takes land s end john o groats charity","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Theres nothing stopping me from doing anything: Welshpool man to hand cycleof UKAndrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"last call hunt champions businesses powys","story":"Powys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured is Cllr Rosemarie Harris .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured front left to right, Cllr Martin WealeCeri StephensBeverley Blt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsBiz awards logo\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsITVrsquos Coast  Country TV presenter Andrew Price will be presenting thiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts yearrsquos Powysltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Business Awards.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10113832.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women.

Bathroom waste is restricted to ceramics, taps and shower glass with tiles classed as rubble waste.Oil tanks and drums are not permitted at any of the districtrsquos household recycling centres, alongside fluorescent tubes and liquid waste.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran welcomed the opening of the new facility.ldquoThere has been a need for this new centre for some considerable time and hopefully this investment will ensure people do not have to queue up to use it, he said.ldquoA large facility with increased skip capacity is exactly what is needed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Noel helps Saray join record books with Everest expedition  ","story":"DROMARA adventurer Noel Hanna has been stopped in his intrepid tracks mdash by an international incident between Iran and the US.He had planned to scale the highest volcano in Asia this month but the Iranian air strike against an US drone last month meant that diplomatic relations would be volatile in the coming weeks and months.The  year-old had planned to led a team of climbers up Mount Damavand in Iran, which stands at ,m.ldquoAfter the Iran drone strike and the US threatening to retaliate we were advised not even to think about it, said Noel.Noel spoke to the Recorder about his latest venture up Mount Everest when he led the first successful ascent of the worldrsquos highest mountain by a black woman.He and South African businesswoman Saray Khumalo made global headlines when they reached the top of the ,-metre high summit on May .It was Ms Khumalorsquos fourth attempt and Noelrsquos ninth successful ascent of Everest.Noel explained that he was asked to take Saray at the last moment when she became aware that another black African woman was also planning to climb Everest.ldquoSeveral months before the expedition started she came to me about doing Everest in .

the Education Authority and CCMS to seek a solution which would ldquoallow the long tradition of Catholic provision to continue in the school.Fr McHugh praised the loyalty and support of the

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our submission is that evidence may not have been complete or fully accurate.Senior coroner for North WalesJohn Gittins rejected the application and said it was ldquotactical and designed to get round a previously rejected application to call Mr Shottonrsquos statement.An appeal against the coronerrsquos earlier ruling not to allow that evidence, which included text messages relating to the behaviour of Mr Sargeant, was rejected by the High Court earlier this year.Mr Gittins said: ldquoCalling the witness is a further bite of that same cherry. The court heard Mrs Sargeant was only aware of one anonymous letter sent to her about her husband in , alleging he was not fit to be around women.But Ms McGahey said evidence from Mr Shotton suggested another letter had been received.In a statement, Mr Shotton said in early  he had been told by fellow Labour councillor Bernie Attridge that Mr Sargeant had received an anonymous letter making allegations about him being seen in a pub beer garden with a woman.Mr Shotton also said an alleged incident involving Mr Sargeant had occurred at the evening reception of his wedding, although he said he did not witness it.Ms McGahey said the evidence could be key to the ldquocredibility and reliability of Mrs Sargeantrsquos evidence and could provide information about what ldquoincidents or allegations may have been preying or were preying on Mr Sargeantrsquos mind when he took his own le.Leslie Thomas QC, representing Mrs Sargeant and her son Jack, said Mr Shottonrsquos evidence was made up of rumour.He said: ldquoThe deceased person is not here to defend themselves. This is not a trial, remember there has been no investigation into these rumours and suspicion.On Tuesday, Mrs Sargeant told the hearing at Ruthin County Hall that her husband had been ldquoshell-shocked by the allegations and she believed him ldquo% when he denied them.Mr Gittins said: ldquoThis is not a trial, having reviewed the statement of Aaron Shotton and evidence he might be able to give, there is nothing in it that mentions that Mrs Sargeant had knowledge, which she denied yesterday.He said the application was ldquooutside the scope of the inquest and ldquoopportunistic.Gordon Nardell QC, a lawyer for the Labour Party, gave a statement to the inquest setting out reviews of policies and procedures.He said: ldquoThe Labour Party has learned lessons around Carl Sargeantrsquos tragic death.Mr Gittins told the court he no longer needed to hear evidence from Mr Sargeantrsquos son Jack, who had been due to be called on Thursday.He rejected an application by the media to disclose the text messages between Mr Attridge and Mr Shotton which had been referred to in legal arguments.The court was adjourned until midday on Thursday when the coroner was expected tohis judgment..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Coroner rejects application to hear Sargeant misconduct allegations evidence article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Our intervention demonstrates that we will take all the necessary steps to keep consumers safe.ldquoI want to reassure consumers that we are doing everything to ensure consumers with unmodied machines are made aware and have their tumble dryer replaced.ldquoConsumers with an unmodied machine should contact Whirlpool to arrange a free replacement.Jeff Noel, vice president of communications and public affairs at Whirlpool Corporation, said: ldquoSafety is Whirlpoolrsquos top priority. Thatrsquos why we have been working with the Government for some time to reach todayrsquos agreement to launch an enhanced campaign that will offer customers who own a tumble dryer that has yet to be modied to the highest safety and quality standards the opportunity to have it replaced free of charge.ldquoWersquove always put customer safety first, thatrsquos why we voluntarily approached Trading Standards immediately after we purchased Indesit in  and became aware of a potential concern with two types of tumble dryers manufactured between  and .ldquoThe extended recall programme announced today will offer consumers several options that include replacement, deeply discounted exchange as well as flexible free of charge in home modication that has been available since . We urge consumers with unmodied dryers to contact us on    or visit our websites.The announcement follows Whirlpool admitting to MPs last week that the number of faulty tumble-dryers in homes across the country could be far higher than first thought. Executives from the company told the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee that the true number could be , and it was working hard to mody those affected.Whirlpool also revealed that in recent years, it had logged  fires in its tumble dryers and admitted that three of those were models that had already been updated.MPs were taking evidence over the scandal that has seen . million products modied.One witness Jemma Spurr, a victim whose modied dryer caught fire, told politicians she was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement about the incident, which MPs said was used for ldquoshutting people up.She was given an apology by Whirlpoolrsquos communications chief Jeff Noel. Turning to Ms Spurr, he said: ldquoI apologise to you for whatever distress this situation has caused to you, to your family, to your loved ones and your neighbours.Ashley Martin, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: ldquoWe urge consumers who think they may have one of the affected models to engage with the recall process because it is so important that these dryers are removed from homes.ldquoAs well as those who have bought their own tumble dryers, we would urge landlords and anyone  who has provided a tumble dryer for use by others to urgently check whether their dryer is affected.Sue Davies, from consumer group Which , said: ldquoWe have serious doubts about Whirlpoolrsquos ability to urgently get these faulty machines out of peoplersquos homes given the companyrsquos history of dragging its heels and its failure to find hundreds of thousands of machines that could still be in circulation almost four years on.ldquoIt is critical that the Government closely oversees this long overdue recall and definitively establishes the safety of modied machines, which the company has acknowledged have also caught fire,they are to be offered as replacements..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Whirlpool to issue recall of unmodied tumble dryers from consumers u homes article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
