Billionaire tycoon Stephen Ross\u0027 many companies include Equinox and SoulCycle         Various celebrities have cited the fundraiser and announced boycotts of SoulCycle and EquinoxAll this is part of a wider, deeply sinister theme about the hard millennial left that suggests they feel entitled to shame and abuse anyone who supports Trump.A few days ago, Democrat congressman Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas named and shamed 44 Trump donors in his state, accusing them of ‘fuelling a campaign of hate’.By doing so, and including the names of all their firms, he wanted these people punished, professionally and personally.He made them targets for abuse, and possibly violence.When news broke that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 77, had broken his shoulder in a fall on Sunday night, enraged liberal protestors raced to his home in Kentucky to scream ‘F*ck you, f*ck your wife, f*ck everything you stand for!’They proudly broadcast their actions on Facebook Live.We’ve seen female White House officials like Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders horribly abused, physically assaulted, and thrown out of restaurants.Yet the people doing all this vile stuff are the same people who profess to hate Trump because he is so ‘intolerant’.The truth is that there is nothing more intolerant than the modern American hard millennial left as represented by the likes of Chrissy Teigen.They furiously preach ‘compassion, empathy and humanity’ yet have none themselves.And their own moral self-righteousness is of coursed riddled with rank hypocrisy.Ms Teigen and her celebrity friends all enthusiastically supported Barack Obama in fundraisers despite the fact he deported 3 million immigrants, broke all US presidential records for dropping bombs, and kept illegal torture center Guantanamo Bay open throughout his presidency despite making its closure a key campaign pledge in 2008.I have no problem with Chrissy Teigen cancelling her accounts with Equinox and SoulCycle.In fact, I’m delighted that this will now reduce the chance of me finding myself accidentally stationed next to her irritating little PC-crazed face on a spinning bike.But I do have a big problem with her and her multi-millionaire celebrity pals trying to destroy the jobs of so many hard-working young people working at these gyms just because she doesn’t agree with the political views of a man who owns the parent company.It’s a new kind of fascism, and it’s disgusting."},{"url":null,"title":"JAN MOIR imagines secret diary Summers summer love","story":"Share this article Chapter 7: Just mucking about  Paul\u0027s orce from his wife comes through.

Without GPS, our military would lose sight of both enemy and friendly forces, as well as rendering unmanned vehicles, smart missiles and early-warning systems useless.In military terms, space has become the ultimate \u0027high ground\u0027 that brings dominance over the land below. Both Russia and China now regard space as a fighting domain, and are even creating aerospace forces. Russia\u0027s MiG-31 fighter, which can fly 15.5 miles above the Earth, will soon be armed with anti-satellite missiles.Since the Cold War, Russia has been developing a range of weapons systems with varying levels of success, including orbiting space stations armed with cannons, direct energy weapons using high-power microwaves or lasers, and also kamikaze-style satellites, which can be instructed to destroy those belonging to the enemy.It is now creating subtler space weapons, which can covertly damage a rival country\u0027s satellites, thus creating economic chaos and political instability.Attacks could be extremely difficult to trace. A laser weapon, for example, could be used to damage optical sensors on a rival satellite, \u0027blinding\u0027 it and thereby rendering it useless, but with no sign of who was responsible.China\u0027s intentions are also raising eyebrows. Beijing says its far-side lunar landing was for the benefit of all of humanity, but it is clear it has intentions to robotically mine mineral elements that are in short supply here on Earth.The Moon is a potential treasure-trove of priceless resources, including helium-3, which is found in the lunar soil and is a potential future energy source for further space exploration. The lunar poles are suspected to contain sub-surface ice. Would China share this precious, life-sustaining asset with other lunar missions?         Tobias Ellwood warns of a \u002721st Century Space Race with an ever-growing possibility that the satellite technology we all rely on for the internet, smartphones, GPS and defence could be brought crashing down around our ears\u0027It is important that our Government acts, and quickly.Firstly, we must develop resilient systems that enable early detection of satellite disruption and effectively deal with the aftermath. Given how dependent we have become on space services, this is also in our commercial interests.We already have the expertise. The £400 billion space industry is one of the fastest-growing economic sectors, with British companies responsible for about ten per cent of global turnover. Furthermore, one in four telecoms satellites contains British components.Secondly, this political intent must be backed by increased defence spending. As current tensions in the Strait of Hormuz starkly illustrate, our defence budget is struggling to cope with present-day threats.If we are to expand our defensive capabilities to deal with tomorrow\u0027s cyber and space threats, we must increase defence spending towards three per cent of GDP over the life of Parliament.This would take us from £40 billion to £60 billion, but because it would include investment in our industrial base, it would be economically viable. We spent four per cent of GDP on defence in the Cold War.At today\u0027s levels of spending, the UK will soon be overtaken by France and Germany. America, in comparison, spends £538 billion.Thirdly, we must join France and the US in creating a UK Space Command to sit under the umbrella of the RAF, enhancing our ability to monitor hostile activity, defend our space assets and, if necessary, launch attacks.This new command would send a powerful message to friend and foe alike that Britain\u0027s hard-earned reputation of stepping forward on the international stage as a force for good is set to continue in this new technological age.Finally, Britain has the global reach and reputation for defending the rule of law to lead a crucial international debate on setting new rules for space.As Neil Armstrong suggested 50 years ago, space should be a global endeavour that benefits all mankind. This new age of exploration demands wise leadership, collaboration and, critically, enforceable governance. Britain should be helping to shape the new rules of space before it\u0027s too late. Failure could be catastrophic for all of us. "},{"url":null,"title":"Jeremy Kyle make TV return soon early year","story":"Share this articleJeremy Kyle lined up for TV return for first time since lie detector ‘suicide’ tragedy – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Taylor Swift Karlie Kloss friendship turned sour crazy argument","story":"Share this articleInside the downfall of Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss\u0027 friendshipTaylor Swift on 30 Things She Learned Before Her 30th Birthday - Taylor Swift Turns 30Taylor Swift¿s September Issue: The Singer On Sexism, Scrutiny, and Standing Up for Herself | VogueYael Cohen Braun on Instagram: ¿@taylorswift, I¿m here to talk privately anytime.¿"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman 37 accused inventing aristocratic lineage visa","story":"Share this article But this supposed descendant of the 15th Earl of Perthshire has been accused of inventing her illustrious lineage to get a spouse visa to enter Britain from Australia.Records show there is no such title as the Earl of Perthshire – and although there is an Earl of Perth, members of his family are adamant that Kristyna is not a relative.And, disappointingly for anyone hoping their job application will succeed, the Earl’s family say the Isla Drummond Hay, which lies 1,100 miles south of the Chilean capital of Santiago, does not belong to them.

Pictured at their wedding with workmen as witnesses‘Lady Kristyna’ first made the news last year as a wealthy aristocrat who had married a former farmer after meeting him on a dating app for people who love the countryside called Muddy Matches.But last night, as their tangled story unfolded, her husband, Michael Lloyd, 34, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, told The Mail on Sunday that he regrets the marriage. He said: ‘I feel really embarrassed and I feel I can’t trust anyone any more.’Mr Lloyd, an ex-Royal Engineer who served in Helmand province, Afghanistan, said Kristyna contacted him on Muddy Matches when he was orcing his first wife, telling him that though she lived in Australia, she belonged to an aristocratic family in Perth.‘She said she would come to the UK and we could live in her farm in Scotland,’ he said.         The bungalow in Melbourne, Australia, where Lady Kristyna Drummond-Hay lived as a tenantBut when Kristyna did eventually come to the UK, she mainly stayed at a hotel in Birmingham at his expense and Mr Lloyd said she gave a string of excuses to stop him meeting her British family.‘I asked if she wanted to see her cousins and she said no because they were working,’ he said. After she returned to Australia, Mr Lloyd visited Kristyna in Melbourne and, within a day, the couple married in an empty hall at the Melbourne Welsh Church. Photos of the wedding show a modest affair, at which two builders signed the marriage certificate as witnesses. On the certificate, her name is ‘Kristyna Halyburton’, not ‘Drummond-Hay.’Mr Lloyd returned to the UK after a week due to work commitments, and without seeing Kristyna’s home in Melbourne. Almost immediately, she applied to the Home Office for a spouse visa for Britain.He said he later found out she was a secretary in a taxi firm. She had told him she was descended from a secret son of the 15th Earl of Perth, William Huntly Drummond, who was born in 1871 and, after marrying a British woman, had been sent to India as an official in the Raj.         The Mail on Sunday tracked down Ms Drummond-Hay’s last-known address to a one-bed rented bungalow in a Melbourne suburb – a far cry from Stobhall Castle (pictured) in Perth, the 14th Century seat of the Perths, with 23 bedrooms and 196 acresThere, she claims, the Earl formed a bigamous marriage with another British woman and had a son, Harry Denzil Drummond-Hay, who Kristyna said was her father.She said Harry grew up in India and moved to Australia, marrying a woman called Diane Halyburton. But records show Huntly Drummond died childless in 1937, without any hint of secret wives.When Mr Lloyd confronted his wife about her background, he says she began sending hostile messages to him, his mother and his ex-wife, warning them not to damage her chances of getting a UK visa.He said he has since had to change his mobile number to stop her ‘stalking’ him, and now believes he was deceived, after spending what he says was at least £10,000 on her in Britain and on the wedding.Mr Lloyd said: ‘She definitely did this to get a visa. She has brought so much trouble, my mother has fallen ill.’ He is now talking to his solicitor about a orce. James Strathallan, 53, heir of the current 18th Earl of Perth, said: ‘She certainly has nothing to do with my family. She sounds like a naive fantasist.’ He also said the family do not own Isla Drummond Hay.

She said in a statement: ‘Michael is a known liar, cheater. Our marriage ended – and it’s me who is filing for orce – due to his infidelities.‘I have not deceived anyone. On the contrary, it is me who has been deceived. I asked Michael to move to Australia several times. If anything, it would be an Australian being used for a visa.’ She also insisted that a branch of her family who lived in the United Arab Emirates, owns Isla Drummond Hay.Asked by The Mail on Sunday for details, the Chilean Embassy was unable to say even if the island was in private ownership, after a week of searching for the answers.It is unclear why someone would invite applicants to be paid castaways on the island if they do not own it and do not have access to appropriate funds for the scheme.Additional reporting from Roger Maynard in Melbourne "},{"url":null,"title":"Britains loneliest dog shelters longest serving resident","story":"Share this article \u0027It\u0027s never anything Sam\u0027s done, he\u0027s just constantly found himself in the wrong home at the wrong time.\u0027He\u0027s currently our longest-serving resident.

He had spotted a man around 50 metres away, incongruously wearing a suit to the beach – perhaps an office worker on his lunch break – and Summerfield could tell the scene had potential. “He looked like a character from a Magritte painting,” he recalls. “Suddenly he lifted and folded his paper. I waited for the peak of the movement, so that it looked frozen, static, as though that was how he had always been and would be for ever. When you see a picture and you know it’s a good one, your heart skips. It’s a real adrenaline rush.”Over 45 years, Summerfield has been travelling to coastal resorts up and down the country, where he captures black-and-white images of life by the beach while ostensibly on holiday. At 72, the photographer still takes pictures every day, but the beach provides something his home town, Oxford, can’t. “On the coast, there’s a spaciousness looking out to sea – it has a potential for images of isolated figures,” he says. “I found the life of figures on the beach ideal for picture-taking, with a clear view beyond of sea and sky, away from the clutter of the streets.”Working with his wife and collaborator, Patricia, Summerfield has now organised the disparate photographs into a new book, with the order evoking a loose narrative. Exploring themes of isolation, disappearance and rebirth, the book reflects the influence of cinema on his work: Michelangelo Antonioni’s Blow-Up, Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson. “Taking pictures is the easy part – the hardest thing is to make the book about something,” Summerfield says. Unlike films, however, photographs offer “slow time”: “You can go at your own pace and examine each inidual frame. You see a photograph, and it’s permanent.”• Paddy Summerfield’s The Holiday Pictures (Dewi Lewis, £30) is out now.

Two decades on, we ask her, how does it stand up in our world of tech giants and personal brands?Some political books capture the zeitgeist with such precision that they seem to blur the lines between the page and the real world and become part of the urgent, rapidly unfolding changes they are describing. On 30 November 1999, mere days before the publication of Naomi Klein’s debut, No Logo, the epochal “Battle of Seattle” began. Tens of thousands turned out to protest against the World Trade Organisation, and the global corporate interests it represented, and were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades. Seattle’s mayor declared a state of emergency, and a massive “no protest zone”, as the violence continued, while the chief of police resigned.Reading No Logo back then in my first year at university was hugely formative the book, mixing eye-opening reportage with sharp-tongued analysis of consumer capitalism, was a bible for understanding the world my generation was growing up in and the motor behind a new kind of grassroots politics. The battle lines were clear, as ordinary citizens around the world stood in opposition to corporate greed, sweatshops, union-busting, “McJobs”, privatisation and environmental destruction: and the avatar for them all, the increasingly unavoidable logos of western “superbrands”.No Logo was published on the cusp not just of a new millennium, but a new phase of globalisation, in which household names such as McDonald’s, Nike, Shell, Starbucks, Disney, Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Microsoft could trample over workers’ rights, local laws and civic opposition in pursuit of ever bigger profits, as western outsourcing crashed against the shores of the developing world, leaving behind human misery and environmental ruin as the tide rolled out.The book charted the dramatic rise in the west of youth-oriented, cool-hungry consumer capitalism, in which companies sold an idealised lifestyle, not the physical product on the shelf. With the factories and production lines moved out of sight, and out of mind, the superbrands could focus their north American and European operations on ever more elaborate and intrusive marketing schemes and protecting their brand through censorship and legal action. In one infamous case, Disney sued a small-town creche for painting an unauthorised mural of their characters. Privatisation, Naomi Klein observed in No Logo, “slithers into every crevice of public life”.Caustically funny and polemical in places, Klein’s book won plaudits for her dogged research and reportage, from the candid and stomach-turning declarations of the brand gurus and snake-oil sellers to first-hand reporting from the sweatshops in the developing world’s semi-lawless “export processing zones”.It became a new truism, for those of us schooled in No Logo’s worldview, that corporations were becoming more powerful than governments. Where previous generations had focused on the oppressive strictures of militarism, racism, nuclear power or patriarchy, the superbrands now became synonymous with all that was wrong with the world. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, they roamed across the globe unhindered and their marketing-first mentality took over party politics too: New Labour, reflected a piece in ad-land bible Campaign marking the tenth anniversary of the 1997 general election, was “perhaps the most brand-savvy political project in British history”.No Logo had a global impact far beyond anything Naomi Klein – only 29 at the time and unknown outside her native Canada – had expected. It became a bestseller in the UK (among numerous other countries) and was translated into more than 30 languages, with more than a million copies in print worldwide. The instant success propelled her to fame and Klein’s subsequent books The Shock Doctrine, No Is Not Enough and This Changes Everything were all bestsellers (her newest, On Fire, making the case for a green New Deal, arrives in September). No Logo inspired numerous musicians and artists: Radiohead were so swayed by the book that they toured Europe in a tent to avoid corporate-sponsored venues and considered naming their 2000 album No Logo, before finally alighting on Kid A. The book did so well, in fact, that Klein’s publisher tried to persuade her that they should copyright the title and logo others, seemingly oblivious to the irony, even proposed a No Logo clothing line. Incredulous, Klein declined.“No Logo hit at this moment when a global movement was exploding and taking mainstream commentators entirely by surprise,” says Klein on the phone from the west coast of Canada. “It felt a bit like a dam breaking – every month, there was another massive demonstration, across the world, not just in the global north.” She had real trouble finding a US publisher for the book, she recalls. They would tell her how much they loved the manuscript, but that there would be no interest in it: “The perception among media and cultural gatekeepers in the late 90s was that young people were completely apolitical.”What strikes me, rereading the book now, is not that Klein was wrong in her diagnosis, but that the changes she was documenting are so much worse than we could have ever predicted – from PepsiCo exploring the idea of broadcasting its logos into space to KFC buying festival DJ slots for Colonel Sanders. We have reached an audio-visual climax of total brand dominance, as if Piccadilly Circus or Times Square were simply laboratories for how our world would look in the 21st century.So what happened to the focused anti-corporate anger Klein describes in the book? In an age of synergistic “brand personalities” with “strong voices”, integrated social media strategies, trend forecasters and micro-influencers, have we given in to the total branding of every aspect of our lives and culture?The critical moment for the global justice movement, when it was perhaps still to reach its full potential, arrived with the 911 attacks in the US less than two years later and the wholesale change in the political conversation that quickly ensued. The west was swept up by George W Bush’s “you’re with us or against us” rhetoric, the “war on terror”, the rise of surveillance and the neoconservative adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq. The urgency of the anti-war movement absorbed western energies.As well as shifting activists’ focus away from the sportswear and fast food brands, the Bush-era crackdown drove a wedge between the more radical anti-capitalist activists on the one hand and the bigger NGOs and trade unions. “When governments started equating the global justice movement with terrorists, a lot of them got spooked,” Klein says. “What had been so exciting about these coalitions was they were so erse: you had scruffy anarchists, big shiny mainstream NGOs and auto workers’ unions all alongside one another, doing really hard and sometimes fractious work to find common ground, but they did it. In South America, India and elsewhere, these movements continued, but the north left them behind.”This reaches even more flagrant extremes as the companies that were initially paying for product placement in films and TV programmes become original content-creators. Where once we might have seen Jerry Seinfeld ostentatiously drinking Pepsi and wearing Nike trainers in an episode of his sitcom, we now have Pepsi Max TV and Nike TV channels on YouTube, producing their own content: not just adverts, but short documentaries, featurettes, competitions and interviews, with viewcounts often in the millions.Corporate brands swamp our digital lives, resulting in the uncanny spectacle of their social media accounts bantering with one another on Twitter, sassily posting pop culture gifs and responding to breaking news events “in voice”. Many of them have also developed their pre-existing corporate social responsibility programmes into a performance of “wokeness”, to both generate headlines and head off some of our boredom and scepticism. Whether it’s Dove soap challenging body fascism in the beauty industry or Gillette attempting to tackle toxic masculinity in the name of selling razors, our woke pounds are there for the taking.On another level to its rivals in this regard is Nike, most recently harnessing a portentous mixture of feminist (“breaking every single glass ceiling”) and self-help rhetoric via Megan Rapinoe and the US women’s football team. When the company made headlines last autumn with its Dream Crazy advert that featured NFL star Colin Kaepernick, controversial for kneeling during the national anthem in protest at police racism and brutality, the reports underneath told their own story. First, the advert was widely reported as appearing in celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Just Do It campaign, a landmark purely because it was three decades since a previous ad campaign. Second, Nike CEO, Mark Parker, responded to the controversy by telling Marketing Week he was proud of the ad: it was a success because it drove “record engagement”. Not sales – brand engagement. “We’re motivated to inspire our consumers to connect and engage,” Parker continued. Not buy trainers.“Kaepernick is an incredible activist and what he’s done is historic – and he’s also given away a huge amount of money to grassroots groups. That doesn’t let Nike off the hook, but I think just condemning Kaepernick for taking their money is ridiculous.”In the UK, this balancing act is reflected in Stormzy’s simultaneous role as high-profile Adidas brand ambassador and outspoken critic of the Conservative government, the Daily Mail and others. Plied with free Adidas merchandise since he was an underground grime MC, cut him and you suspect he would bleed three stripes. When Paul Pogba signed for Manchester United (who also wear Adidas) in 2016 for a record £100m, the deal was announced by a special Adidas-produced video featuring the two of them, soundtracked by Stormzy, a perfect piece of four-way brand synergy. But did this affiliation stop Stormzy putting in one of the most powerful and controversial political performances in living memory at the 2018 Brit awards, calling the political establishment “criminals” for their betrayal of the victims of the Grenfell fire? Of course not.“When musicians and athletes don’t accept the idea that because they have corporate sponsors, they have to keep quiet, it can take us to some interesting places,” Klein avers.There are two things driving the brands’ ongoing territorial expansion. The first is that consumer capitalism is boring and so constantly requires innovative, ever more ridiculous stunts to hold our increasingly fragmented attention. That’s why “experiential marketing” (PR stunts, in old money) is the ad-land buzzphrase. Senior marketeer Hilary Bradley told Campaign magazine last autumn that millennials in particular needed “memorable experiences” to help them “emotionally connect” to a product.The second is that consumer capitalism is insatiable – it is the same reason businesses are pushing for cities to function around the clock, to fit in more shopping and advertising time, trying to effectively “colonise the night”, an idea the American art critic Jonathan Crary explored in his 2013 book 247: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep. In April, the news broke that PepsiCo was working with a Russian “space startup” to look into projecting its logos into the night skies via a series of satellites. Like all empires, consumer capitalism always requires new territory to conquer.And we are often unwilling subjects. Consumers, marketing executive David Lubars told Klein in No Logo, in a moment of perfect candour, “are like roaches – you spray them and spray them and they get immune after a while.” Since 1999, the spray has become considerably more potent and it’s getting everywhere. Not just trainers, razors and soft drinks, but places, spaces, charities, local councils, human beings: all of them need a brand identity, because all of them are pitching themselves in the global marketplace. As the public sphere becomes ever more emaciated by cuts, corporations step in.Brands are literally filling in holes in the road with their logos: in Louisville, Kentucky, KFC filled in a plague of potholes, stamping them with a stencil that read “Re-freshed by KFC”. They paid what is small change in advertising terms – $3,000 – to fix 350 potholes in the city, or buy 350 adverts. “Cities are struggling all over America and you do what you can,” Louisville’s mayor, Jerry Abramson, told NPR. “We’re fortunate to have such an outstanding corporate citizen in this community.”Occupying physical space beyond a billboard has always been appealing when Adidas signed its “tier one” £40m London 2012 Olympic partnership deal, it cannily struck an agreement to plant inner-city sporting “AdiZones” (outdoor gyms), and thus its logos, in public spaces across the country, for up to 20 years. It was a nod to the idea of trickle-down athleticism made by the Games, leaving what are essentially semi-permanent, 3D billboards in public spaces, in return for a minuscule investment – and some free publicity to boot.This was just the latest iteration of a 1990s scene Klein describes in No Logo – Nike marketeers visiting inner-city basketball courts in mostly black neighbourhoods in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, branding the courts with the company’s logo, and giving out trainers to the most stylish alpha males, in a pre-digital version of “influencer” culture.One vital trend that was just emerging when No Logo was published and is now a near-universal experience – for those entering the job market, at least – is that of self-branding: commodifying and selling yourself, carefully “curating” your “socials” and general online presence, in response to the frenetic demands of the gig economy (the number of self-employed young adults in the UK has almost doubled since 2001). “It was really only celebrities who could actually be their own brand, in 1999,” Klein says. “The idea that a high-school student could have a ‘personal brand’ would have seemed absurd.“The biggest change since No Logo came out is that neoliberalism has created so much precarity that the commodification of the self is now seen as the only route to any kind of economic security. Plus social media has given us the tools to market ourselves non-stop.” This worries Klein because it hinders solidarity: “Brands don’t cooperate very well – they’re built to be selfish and proprietary.”In her position as the Gloria Steinem chair at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Klein has been teaching a course to undergraduates called The Corporate Self, tracing the journey from the birth of branding, and her own No Logo, up to Shoshana Zuboff’s acclaimed book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, published in the UK in January. Zuboff may do for big tech what Klein did for the superbrands 20 years ago. They watch and critique the Colin Kaepernick ads, Klein says, comparing them to the Michael Jordan equivalents from the 1980s and 90s.“It’s been fun to talk to them about surveillance capitalism, because they’ve grown up with it – they’ve grown up in it – and to follow the emerging ways people are confronting the tech giants.” She recently brought in as speakers some of the organisers of 2018’s Google walkout protest, in which thousands of the corporation’s employees walked out of work in protest at the handling of sexual harassment and gender inequality.“We’re more globally connected than ever before,” Klein says, “and also less connected to who makes our clothes, who grows our food, and I think part of that is down to information overload. And in terms of what social media is doing to our ability to stay focused, to not see the world in terms of these matrices of our own marketability and consumability, whether it’s views or likes or retweets…” She sighs. “Well, I think this may be the death of us. It’s not that people don’t care, it’s that they care for five seconds. That acceleration of emotion, and attention – it’s a pretty big shift in 20 years.“I think the next big battles will be over the information commons: the entire business model of these tech giants is an extractive model, based on people’s unpaid labour. It’s been the most incredible bait-and-switch, to simultaneously say, ‘Don’t be evil’ and persuade us to live our lives in public and online and share everything.”There is, however, one small part of our relationship with brands that the internet and social media have perhaps democratised – the ability to control the memes of production. “In No Logo, in the ‘adbusting’ chapter, I was writing about a few daring guys with ladders, defacing billboards,” she laughs, “and now you have millions of people able to do parody ads and share them with everyone, instantaneously.”While the images of black-clad protesters on the streets of Seattle in 1999 may have marked a rupture of sorts, the rapid decline of the global justice movement it heralded is not something to be entirely mourned by activists, Klein says, because another kind of progress has been made. “It’s easy to lose sight of just how hegemonic neoliberalism really was, in the late 1990s. There is an ascendant democratic socialist left in the west now and it’s liberalism that is in crisis.” The global justice movement was, she says, a movement of “nos” and not a lot of “yeses”. “It’s taken a while to get the political and intellectual confidence to not only say ‘no’ to the ravages of neoliberal austerity, but to propose bold and imaginative structural transformation.“The real sea change between then and now is that that critique of corporate power is utterly mainstream. If you look at the US presidential candidates, not just Elizabeth Warren’s or Bernie Sanders’s campaigns but even some of the more mainstream candidates – everybody has to talk about breaking up big tech and standing up to the fossil fuel companies.”Maybe it’s partly that our relationships with the companies behind the logos have changed dramatically since 1999 too. Another example of a new trend recorded in No Logo that’s become commonplace is the gig economy, or precarious work. People have no reciprocal relationship, no give and take, with their big-name corporate employers. In the Fordist era of production-line factory jobs after the war, many workers may have had miserably mundane nine-to-fives but at least those came with stability, pensions and as jobs for life. The gig economy is shattering any lingering sense of trust in or fidelity to corporations. “Wide-scale public rage at oligarchic power is very mainstream now,” Klein says.And that surely can’t be good for the brand.Perhaps it is a function of age, but recalling the world No Logo described when I was 18 – a world before 911 and the “war on terror”, before the global financial crisis and before the gig economy and big tech set the terms of your employment and social life respectively – does feel like harking back to a more innocent time. It would be easy for me to get an Uber to a WeWork office, order some Deliveroo and finish this article on Google Docs, while I stream Spotify, taking a break to browse Facebook and Instagram on my Android phone, finesse my personal brand on Twitter and wonder where the No Logo revolution all went wrong.But it was never as simple as merely boycotting brands you vaguely disapproved of the thrust of the book, and the global justice movement in general, was not about making more tasteful shopping decisions, but understanding how corporations shape our lives and culture and using that knowledge to try to, at least, stop them from running riot. The stakes are higher now than they were in the 1990s and this time, thanks to books such as No Logo, we can’t say that we didn’t know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30ba029d8c90880a4f3a2bff711a7a834f25a68/295_260_1674_1004/master/1674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e13b8604e265708b5f35e349dc0f21db","title":"all the stuff of life goes on here the wine bar that bath fell in love with","story":"Intimate, personalised service has made Beckford Bottle Shop a favourite for first dates, long lunches and more As you enter Beckford Bottle Shop, a new bar, restaurant and wine shop with views over Bath’s Assembly Rooms, it’s impossible to miss the huge, U-shaped sofa skirting the back wall. It’s the focal point of the room and, as it turns out, the focal point of the business. “The sofa creates this space for people to hang out,” says Dan Brod, Beckford’s co-owner. “It’s also communal, so it kind of forces people to talk to each other – which, as a nation, we’re generally terrible at. When you go to Spain everyone hangs out and chats in the village square. The sofa is our version of the square.”The welcoming atmosphere is something the team at Beckford have considered since day one. The owners all come from a background of members’ clubs and own several other “poncey pubs with rooms, I think is the official name,” laughs Brod. As a result, customer experience is key. “We’ve come at the wine world putting wine at the bottom and service at the top. Traditionally wine shops aren’t like that – it’s wine over everything else and they’re pretty intimidating. You walk in, get scared and choose whatever’s on the middle shelf,” he says.“We don’t want to be elitist here. Whether you’re a wine aficionado or just want a glass of something with a snack, our staff will look after you regardless. We’re a sociable environment, the lighting, the music and the welcome when you walk through the door it’s all very considered because hospitality is in our DNA. We want people to have a great experience that sticks with them. I almost want this to be a community centre, which sounds ridiculous but that’s what hospitality is ultimately about – community.”Brod is certainly achieving that wish, as every customer references the atmosphere and the people they’ve met over long lunches or cosy evenings in the snugs.“I don’t think I’ve ever sat on this sofa without everybody on it talking to each other,” says customer Soo Arber. “I’ve made a lot of friends here, including a girl who has recently moved to Bath and doesn’t know anyone. She came along with her glass of fizz we got chatting, ended up swapping emails and now regularly meet up. It’s a space where, particularly as a woman, you don’t feel intimidated by sitting alone, because it’s so friendly.”Fellow customers Anthony Christie and Simon Jones say the venue suits different moods. “If you want to socialise with new people, the sofa is a good place for that. We’ve met a lot of people there,” says Christie. “But then you’ve got the snugs downstairs, which are the perfect place to sit with a gang of friends and lose track of time.” As we chat, the waiter brings some salted almonds over. “They’re not on the menu any more but I know you love them,” he says, much to the pair’s joy. “That shows how personalised the service is here,” says Christie. “We have a relationship with all the guys who work here and they take pleasure in recommending wine and food that they know will meet our palates.”Christie and Jones are self-confessed wine buffs but Casey Ryder, Beckford’s general manager, says their customers are a broad range of people. “We’re very non-pretentious and get customers of all ages and walks of life,” he says. “We see lots of first dates but also older couples out having fun, whose kids come and pick them up afterwards.”He says the small plates menu makes it the perfect date spot. “Sharing plates takes out the slight intimidation of a long three-course meal with a huge bill at the end. Plus, if you decide you’re not into each other, you can leave after a plate of charcuterie. If things are going well you can have a whole meal and take it downstairs, which is much more intimate.”While the management team own other pubs and businesses, they view Beckford Bottle Shop as a business within a business – effectively a startup – and that is why they chose iZettle. “They are a genuine disruptor within the fintech industry. They offer something different and the level of customer service is excellent,” says Brod.“It’s incredibly easy to set up, there are no long contracts, as it’s all month by month, and it’s simple to add new machines. It’s all cloud-based, which is good, as we often do events so can take the machines with us. If I was starting any business I’d use iZettle. Card machines are the last thing you want to think about in a business, but also one of the most important. And I love that iZettle regularly check in and care about what we do, because that’s what our business is about: customer care. I like dealing with companies that share our ethos.”Another customer, Joanne Hodges, echoes Brod’s sentiment around customer service. “You don’t even need to look at the wine list here. I often tell them I fancy trying something new and they just know what you’re after. You don’t have to drink the same wine each time you visit, which gets boring. And I love the mix of people – I’ve met locals as well as people on holiday and everyone is lovely. I particularly like sitting at a table in the shop. It’s like being in a library surrounded by books, only with wine.”Brod says the key to the Beckford Bottle Shop experience is that it’s an evolving space. “You can come for coffee with your laptop in the morning, have a small plate and glass of wine solo, or meet with friends and put a lot of plates together for a full meal. We’ve seen it all: proposals, marriages, dates and affairs – the whole gamut. All the stuff of life goes on here.”So, whatever you’re looking to celebrate next time you’re in Bath, try this community centre with a difference.Explore the benefits of joining the iZettle community at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e0e66d04381501d92ef12ab1a0d1607a2c37d62/0_28_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9263179203b525f8ee19b815b793cf19","title":"for women like me postponing the menopause would be a blessing","story":"Scientific advances that prolong fertility can only be a benefit to many would-be mothersLet us imagine for a moment that we lived in a world where male fertility dropped off a cliff by the time men hit their mid 40s, leaving a group of men who wanted to have children but couldn’t. When would science have produced a fix?I am going to hazard a guess that it would have been quite some time ago. But it has taken until 2019 for a fledgling treatment to delay the menopause by up to 20 years to be offered to women, even though the idea has been around for almost two decades.The treatment involves removing and freezing a small piece of ovarian tissue from women under the age of 40, then regrafting that tissue years later when they reach the menopause. The doctors behind this are clear that the objective is to mitigate the nasty side effects of the menopause that some women experience. But it is not implausible that this could one day be a way to prolong female fertility.That is why I read about it with a sense of excitement. Perhaps I would say this, as a woman in my late 30s who wants but does not yet have children, but I think enabling women to prolong their fertility would be a scientific advance worth celebrating.I am well aware that puts me in a minority. There are two dominant narratives about women who try to prolong their fertility through freezing their eggs. The first is the dominant career woman, selfishly putting off having kids until they are too old to look after them properly (no matter that we don’t judge men who have children in their 50s in the same way). The second is that women only want to prolong their fertility because they are forced into a choice between having kids and sacrificing some career success, and that if you take away that trade-off, that is the problem solved.This chimes with me. I will never stop arguing that we have to address the structural inequalities that mean women’s biology acts as a drag on their careers. But those inequalities are not why I do not yet have children. Even though I shouldn’t have to, I would have made the choice to sacrifice career progress to have had children at this point.Women in their mid-to-late 30s who want children are all too aware of another biological inequality at play: the vastly different rates at which the male and female fertility clocks tick down. Dating at this age means contending with the awful stereotypes of women desperate to bag a man before it is too late. Imagine how liberating it would be to know you have 15 years of fertility left, just as many men of your age do. That is something feminists who have had their children by their early 30s should care about, just as female solidarity behoves women who choose to be childfree to fight the fact that having children curtails mothers’ careers.There will be those who argue that women have only themselves to blame if they are still in the dating pool at 35 in a world where women are a third more likely to go to university than men, they should stop being so fussy. This rather assumes that these women are single because they will not settle for men less educated than they are, rather than vice versa. And – surprisingly, if you buy into the stereotype of men being less keen on kids – similar proportions of male and female graduates born in 1970 were childless at age 42 (about one in four), and similar proportions of those (about one in three) said it was because they had not met the right partner.Perhaps prolonging female fertility could benefit men who meet their partner later in life too. And perhaps, as fertility science develops, this is not to be discouraged. Is it not better to wait a little if need be to raise a child with someone you can spend decades with, rather than settle into a loveless partnership in your early 30s just so you can have children?The problem is the existing science is not good enough: just one in five IVF treatments using frozen eggs results in a live birth. That is partly because the £7,000 or so cost and the invasiveness of the process mean that the average age at which women freeze their eggs is 38, far beyond their fertility peak. That’s why this new treatment to delay menopause is so exciting: a single 30-minute procedure could give women access to thousands of their eggs rather than just a handful years late. It could one day be a less intrusive, more effective and cheaper insurance policy for childless women in their early 30s.Developing a scientific fix for the female fertility cliff edge will not change the fact that for the vast majority of women, the right time for them to have children will be during their naturally fertile years. But there is a small but significant minority who miss the boat because they do not find the right partner in time. It is time to grapple with the fact that the profoundly positive social development of women’s increased educational and professional success might mean that we need to use science to rethink aspects of our biology. To recoil at that is sexism, pure and simple.Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Neither, quite frankly, are they ones anyone would have wished for. Mistakes were made. But let’s be clear about one thing: the voters’ decision to leave the European Union and how politicians have gone about implementing the result are two distinct issues. Criticising the process of leaving is not the same as questioning the referendum outcome. Leave had a clear majority on a high turnout.Whichever way anyone voted, we can probably agree that the paralysis of indecision of this period has been corrosive and damaging. It has entrenched isions and undermined confidence.Liberal democracies need political structures that are capable of governing. It is not sustainable for political parties to have their frontbenchers in disagreement with the backbenchers. In the same way, MPs being out of step with their voters on a major issue rarely ends well. Restoring trust and confidence won’t be easy and it will take time. But we don’t have much time, so clarity of purpose and seeing beyond narrow party politics must be the starting point.The government has a clear and unequivocal commitment to implementing the referendum. The prime minister and his cabinet have not framed their work as being a case of making the best of a bad decision, but as one of looking ahead with optimism and determination.Column inches are being filled with speculation about the personalities involved, but what matters is the fact that a team has come together to make things happen in a relatively short time.At long last we are doing what we should have done after the 2016 vote: saying we are leaving as a statement of fact and doing all that is necessary. For some things we need transition arrangements. But for others we can start to change rules now.We do want to leave with a deal, but if that is not possible then we must prepare to leave without one. As we’ve seen in the past, statements that are not underpinned by actions don’t mean very much.Parliament has been clear about all the things it doesn’t like, but vague about alternatives. There is no logic in MPs saying that they respect the result of the referendum, voting for implementing article 50 and then going on to defeat all options put in front of them in the expectation that this would somehow overturn the referendum.It was wrong to label as “extremist” anyone who suggested that if the UK and the EU could not reach an agreement we should leave in any case. Just as it is wrong now to imply that the only way of avoiding no deal is for the UK to not leave the EU after all.This isn’t just a debate among politicians. There is little consistent evidence that voters have changed their minds and they do expect some clarity. They showed their frustration in the European elections. The greatest gains were made by the Brexit party and the Liberal Democrats, who had clear and unambiguous policies. Labour and the Conservatives opted in varying degrees for “creative ambiguity” and were punished at the ballot box. The Brexit party emerged with the largest number of MEPs, and this can’t be dismissed as a one-off protest vote. In 2014, two years before the referendum, Ukip’s 24 MEPs were also the largest UK grouping.The UK is leaving the union, but it is and remains European. In years to come it will be seen as more remarkable that we decided to join the political project of the core European countries in 1973, rather than prioritising a trading-based relationship by remaining within the European Free Trade Association.The 2016 referendum asked voters for a generational decision about the future direction of this country. They were driven less by economic considerations than by a sense of belonging, community and place. Divisions that had been in the making for a long time were suddenly exposed. These isions run deep and will take a long time to heal.The most significant conclusion to draw from the past three years is that, despite best efforts, this process can’t even begin until the promise to implement the referendum and leave the EU has been delivered. Now is our last chance to deliver on that promise, and begin the process of restoring trust in our institutions.• Gisela Stuart is chair of Change Britain.

An estimated 20,000 people were drawn in, and 4,000 arrested. A subsequent study by the  and the London School of Economics found that “humiliating” stop and search was a key factor in anger towards the police. An independent panel appointed by the government to examine the unrest urged immediate attention to the issue, noting that it was cited as a major source of discontent by young black and Asian men.Now, stop and search is on the rise again. In eight of England’s largest forces, its use doubled in the two years to March 2019. Sajid Javid, then home secretary, nonetheless eased the use of section 60 powers – allowing officers to stop and search anyone in defined areas without reasonable suspicion – for several forces. The prime minister’s announcement on Sunday extends that pilot scheme across all forces in England and Wales.But if his approach speaks to concerns, it cannot answer them. Mr Johnson has reverted to a familiar and failed Conservative playbook of “hard on crime, hard on criminals” rhetoric. (His home secretary, Priti Patel, wants offenders to feel not just fear but terror).Like his pledge to create 10,000 more prison places, or his earlier promise to recruit 20,000 more police officers, his announcement reeks of electioneering. Unlike those, this handily comes without a price tag for the Treasury. So even if the government’s “fiscal headroom” disappears thanks to a no-deal Brexit, this policy will stand.Mr Johnson has glibly dismissed the criticism he expects from “leftwing criminologists”. Several police chiefs see stop and search as an essential tool. But plenty of others will question both the fairness and effectiveness of this strategy.An analysis of the Home Office’s own data found that black people in England and Wales were 40 times more likely to be searched under section 60 powers than white people – exacerbating the disproportion seen with regular stop and search. The damage to police relations with communities is evident and the policy counterproductive. The College of Policing notes that while some studies suggest an impact on crime, it is likely to be “small, highly localised and short-lived”, and that stop and search tends to be less productive the more that it is used.Last month, the outgoing chief of Bedfordshire police, Jon Boutcher, said extra officers were essential, but could not make up for austerity-driven cuts that had left disadvantaged children vulnerable to gangs, damaged the social fabric and must be reversed to reduce crime. He noted in particular those hitting mental health and youth services. Since 2011, when the riots broke out, the number of youth centres in London has fallen from 234 to 130 the number supported by local authorities across England has halved.Extending stop and search powers, while paying only lip service to tackling the causes of crime, is “a tried-and-tested recipe for unrest, not violence reduction”, as the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, warned – and as Mr Johnson’s own experience should tell him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f21c1b5bca8bf4bec4edd247447f03c8c69acea3/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=084dbe2f5fc2f291b5dea9c0ed6cd474 1370w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of lazy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘lazy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘lazy’.Share your photos of what lazy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 14 August at 10am.

It’s usually the Palestine society, or the Islamic society, and I think that’s a clear route of allowing discrimination in our education system.”The government has agreed to an independent review of Prevent, in response to widespread concern that it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. “The Prevent agenda does not need a review,” said Ibrahim, “it needs to be scrapped”.Ibrahim, who was born in Sweden and is the daughter of Somali refugees who fled civil war, has previously spoken out against the media for portraying her as a “fanatical Muslim and a threat to British society” on the basis of comments she wrote on social media as a 16-year-old.In one she joked that if she was president she’d oppress white people “to give them a taste of what they put us through”. In another she said everyone should read the Qur’an. The backlash was devastating. “I suddenly felt unsafe in my own campus, in my own space,” she said.Ibrahim, who came to the UK at the age of 10 and was brought up in Bolton, said her adolescent comments were twisted to make them seem more sinister than they were ever intended to be, and in no way represented her views today.She said: “It was something that was blown out of proportion. I think people know and understand I’m a completely different person from the 16-year-old child that I was, who had no political training and no political education at all at that time.”Ibrahim said her experience was common among young people from Muslim backgrounds or people of colour who dared to step into the public sphere. “To me, what’s been the most upsetting thing is to see young people who would be incredible in these roles to not even think of running because of the backlash that I faced. If it had been any of my white peers or colleagues they would never have experienced that.”Ibrahim said she worried about putting herself forward as a candidate to lead the NUS after witnessing the experience of Malia Bouattia, the first Muslim NUS president, who was subjected to Islamophobic attacks and hate-filled trolling on social media during her tenure.She said: “When I was thinking about running, it was the biggest factor that was putting me off – the backlash and the vilification and all the horrors that would come with it. “But at the same time I recognise it’s not something I should be afraid to do and I want to be able to encourage young people – especially young girls that look like myself – to be able to come into these spaces and make decisions for the institutions they represent and be unapologetic for who they are.”Meanwhile, the Islamophobia directed at young women like Ibrahim continues. On Wednesday, she tweeted: “It doesn’t matter how frequent it happens, what the context is, where it happens or who the perpetrators are, I will always be racially profiled and discriminated against. Who you are, what you’ve achieved and what you do will never matter.”Ibrahim takes over the leadership of the NUS at a difficult time for the union, which has has been forced to undergo a radical overhaul because of a £3m deficit. It has been slashing staff numbers, cutting officer roles and selling off its London headquarters in Gray’s Inn Road in order to avoid financial collapse.The union’s considerably more modest new home is in a corner of Hackney community college. Despite the scaled-down nature of the organisation, Ibrahim is enthusiastic about campaigning for a fully funded education system that is accessible to all.She said: “I want to change the narrative of the way we talk about education and for people to understand education is for the public good. I’ve been in the sector for years and seen the mess that it has got into, and the mess it’s heading towards. Free education is not about me. I’ve got my degree. It’s about future generations that are going to come after me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bd9d78390205b9a4e2c172cde427f5c2e790e35/102_72_3240_1945/master/3240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d9058902676eeabd9460d95d2c4852","title":"greta thunberg leads to boom in books aimed at empowering children to save planet","story":"The 16-year-old climate change activist has galvanised young people to read more about saving the planetSome seek to convey the wonder of endangered animals while others give tips on how to tackle waste or tell tales of inspirational environmental activists.All are part of what children’s publishers are calling “the Greta Thunberg effect”: a boom in books aimed at empowering young people to save the planet.The number of new children’s books looking at the climate crisis, global heating and the natural world has more than doubled over the past 12 months, according to data from Nielsen Book Research shared with the Observer. Sales have also doubled.Whether it’s beautifully illustrated factual books like A Wild Child’s Guide to Endangered Animals, apocalyptic climate catastrophe novels such as Where the River Runs Gold or how-to guides such as Kids Fight Plastic, publishers are targeting a plethora of new fiction and nonfiction titles at young readers inspired by Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate emergency campaigner.Earth Heroes, which features Thunberg on its cover, is one of them. A collection of stories by travel journalist Lily Dyu about 20 inidual inventors and conservationists around the world, including Sir David Attenborough, Yin Yuzhen, Stella McCartney and Thunberg, it was snapped up in June by children’s publishers Nosy Crow.“I absolutely would say there has been a Greta Thunberg effect,” says Rachel Kellehar, head of nonfiction. “She has galvanised the appetite of young people for change, and that has galvanised our appetite, as publishers, for stories that empower our readers to make those changes.”Kellehar has sent the collection hurtling through the publishing process at breakneck speed so that it will hit bookshelves in early October, just before Thunberg find outs if she will be awarded the Nobel peace prize: “We’re turning this around in four months, which is really unusual in children’s publishing.”The message of the book is: you’re not alone and you can make a difference, she says. “We feel it’s important to get that message out as soon as possible, and that is partly driven by the Greta effect. Whether or not she wins the Nobel peace prize, October will be a key moment to reach out and say Greta’s doing this amazing thing, but also lots of other people you’ve never heard of all around the world are doing amazing things. From young girls in Tunisia who have got plastic bags banned, to an engineer in India who is creating artificial glaciers, this is a book about people who are finding different ways to confront climate change head on, wherever it is affecting them.”Bloomsbury will publish a similar collection, Fantastically Great Women who Saved the Planet by Kate Pankhurst, in February. It features women throughout history who have dedicated their lives to studying, conserving and protecting planet Earth. Isobel Doster, senior editor in children’s nonfiction, has also noticed a “Thunberg effect” – a “real thirst” for authors who write about environmental role models to whom children can look up and actions they can take to prevent climate change.“Additionally, there’s been a tonal shift in the natural history books that are coming on to the market, she says. “It’s not enough just to explore the beauty of the natural world – we have a responsibility to tell readers why it’s important to look after it.”Plastic is also a hot topic for nonfiction picture books: Walker Books recently acquired one by MG Leonard called Tale of a Toothbrush, which follows the journey of a single plastic toothbrush, while Hachette Children’s Group brought out A Planet Full of Plastic by Neal Layton earlier this summer.In fiction, Matt Haig’s illustrated chapter book Evie and the Animals – about a girl who wants to save the planet – won plaudits from critics for its timely storyline and strong appeal for Thunberg fans when it appeared on shelves in June. Meanwhile, fans of There’s a Rang-Tan in my Bedroom, the moving Greenpeace cartoon that went viral last year, were delighted when it was published last week as a picture book. Author James Sellick hopes his story – about an orangutan who loses his home and family due to palm oil production and deforestation – will have greater longevity for children in picture-book form, where it can be revisited and given more context from parents. The book also offers tips about actions children can take, such as writing letters to companies that use palm oil.“I want not only to educate but to inspire a new wave of eco warriors. Kids are the future. Hopefully if they have been educated about environmental issues from a young age they will go on – and go further – than we are right now,” said Sellick.Designed in a similar way to inspire the next generation of conservationists, naturalists, biologists, zoologists and nature lovers, A Wild Child’s Guide to Endangered Animals will be published later this month. Author and illustrator Millie Marotta says she is hoping the book will tempt young readers to take a lifelong interest in wildlife conservation and show them there are things everyone can do to help, right now.“We’re losing so many species every year, every month, every day, even. The generation of children who will be reading this book are the ones who are going to be the most impacted, and who will have the biggest impact. They are going to be the people to fix what’s happened and hopefully turn things around.”Written by a long time anti-plastics campaigner and founder of the Beach Clean Network, it shows children what they can do in their home, on days out and at school to reduce the plastic they use.Nonfiction picture book that explains where plastic comes from, why it doesn’t biodegrade and why that’s dangerous for animals and the planet.An adventure story set in a terrifying caste-ided, dystopian world in which bees have long disappeared and children must labour on farms to pollinate crops.

He said: “Thank you for coming back to check on my boys after Louis KO’d himself trying to get a wave!“He loves you so much and the pain went away instantly when you came to give them a hug. A nose reset worth well worth it he said. You are a top man and a true gent!”Louis was taken by ambulance to Alder Hey children’s hospital, where his nose was reset.Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Cooper said: “We live just opposite Melwood and the two boys have been spending their holidays trying to get pictures of their heroes.“Mo Salah was one of the last ones to come out and the boys were waving at him in a bid to catch his attention.“Unfortunately Louis went straight into a lamp-post while running after the car and busted his nose when he hit the floor.“He’d seen one of the boys had hurt himself and he had the decency to drive back into the close to check that he was OK.”Cooper said: “It was a touch of class on Mo Salah’s part to turn round and actively come looking for the boys.“He was really apologetic and saying sorry for something that wasn’t his fault,” he added. “Mo Salah is their hero and the boys were made up.”Salah was one of the scorers during Liverpool’s 4-1 win against Norwich in the first game of the Premier League season on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e71c3c6db719eff59e9ce055b86e5f220c446c78/437_690_2722_1633/master/2722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6cc5604b7111422c76226e3d5359d29","title":"jose mourinho manchester city b team united chelsea punditry","story":"• Mourinho: ‘I think even City’s B team could fight for the title’• United agree €10m deal for Monaco teenager Hannibal MejbriJosé Mourinho has ruled Manchester United and Chelsea out of title contention – and added that Manchester City’s “B team” might be good enough to win the Premier League.Mourinho was a lively presence on Sky Sports in the buildup to the clash between his former clubs at Old Trafford on Sunday, having signed up as a pundit for the new season.Mourinho also gave his thoughts on Chelsea, claiming that his former player, Frank Lampard, will not face the same pressure as he did at Stamford Bridge.If Abraham plays and Chelsea doesn’t win, people can go in the direction of the younger players.

They won, they kept a clean sheet and Ole Gunnar Solskjær was noisily serenaded by all four sides of the ground. Sure, there was the impertinence of José Mourinho, in his new role in the television studios, opining that Manchester City’s B team would stand a better chance of winning the Premier League. Yet this was the fifth season in a row United have won their first game of a top-flight season and the last time that happened was 1910 - the very year that Old Trafford opened for business.Not that anyone should be getting too carried away just yet. Or, indeed, thinking that Mourinho might necessarily have been mistaken. A 4-0 winning margin does not quite tell the full story, particularly when taking into account a first half in which Chelsea’s players often gave their opponents the run-around, hitting the woodwork twice as well as creating all sorts of danger.Ultimately, though, it turned into a chastening experience for Frank Lampard, taking charge of his first match as Chelsea manager. Marcus Rashford, in particular, profited from the shortcomings of the away side, opening the scoring with a first-half penalty and then racing away to put in the third goal barely a minute after Anthony Martial had doubled United lead. Lampard had to endure the now-familiar ‘sacked in the morning’ chant after Daniel James confirmed United’s second-half superiority with a debut goal eight minutes after coming on as a substitute.Yet the more pertinent song, perhaps, came a few minutes earlier when the Stretford End made it clear what they thought of Graeme Souness, the long-term critic of Paul Pogba. Pogba had just supplied the best pass of the match to dissect the entire Chelsea defence, resulting in Rashford slipping the ball past Kepa Arrizabalaga to make it 3-0. Pogba also supplied the decisive pass for James to score with a deflected shot and, on this evidence, maybe even Souness might be forced to concede the French World Cup winner brings more good than bad to this club. Pogba was the last player to leave the pitch, lingering to applaud the section of the Stretford End where he has not always been applauded so warmly. It felt like a man who wanted to repair some of the damage from a summer in which he openly stated he wanted to find another club.That second half was a strange capitulation on Chelsea’s part because the paradox of this game is that for long spells they passed the ball with more authority. They certainly had the better of the opening 45 minutes but still found themselves behind after Kurt Zouma brought down Rashford just inside the penalty area. It was a straightforward decision for the officials monitoring the VAR screens and, though Kepa ed the right way, Rashford’s penalty was struck with enough power to beat the goalkeeper to his right.Until that point, Lampard must have been encouraged by the adventurous way his team had started the match. Tammy Abraham, spearheading their new-look attack, had flashed a 20-yard shot against David de Gea’s post. Mason Mount, operating in the number 10 role (albeit wearing number 19) looked determined to show he could flourish at this level, while Ross Barkley and Pedro were quick to support Abraham when the team broke forward.United, in comparison, needed the opening goal to bring them alive and, even then, Chelsea had enough chances to feel aggrieved to be behind at half-time. Emerson, in particular, was unfortunate with a rising left-footed shot that beat De Gea but ricocheted off the crossbar. Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s saving tackle on Barkley drew an almighty cheer from the home crowd and Harry Maguire, another debutant in United back four, certainly won his fair share of headers on a day when Solskjær did not even include Chris Smalling, Phil Jones or Marcus Rojo among the home team’s substitutes. Overall, however, the opening hour was not easy whatsoever for United’s new defence and they rode their luck at times. Chelsea were just too naive, perhaps – too open, too wasteful in attack, too obliging with their marking.Plus there is a great statistic from the Premier League era that United have never lost after having a half-time lead at Old Trafford (winning 264 times now and drawing the other 16). More and more, it also became evident how Solskjær intends to line up his attack. Here, he started with Andreas Pereira just behind Martial. However, there were times when Jesse Lingard, who started on the right, exchanged positions with Pereira whereas Martial and Rashford did the same on the left. Martial has taken on Romelu Lukaku’s number nine shirt and he certainly finished like one when Pereira swung over the cross for United’s second goal. Pereira had justified his selection. Scott McTominay did, too, alongside Pogba in midfield and Old Trafford, once again, felt like a happy place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e91da7eedc1b2f05dc260a79e03d11e3e25b143f/0_58_4191_2515/master/4191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c9a2cae69781d5af2a0219a26cea8f6","title":"newcastle arsenal premier league match report","story":"A little bit of a boycott and an awful lot of rain ensured that Steve Bruce’s Newcastle United reign began in downbeat mode as Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang emphasised his enduring importance to Arsenal by cutting through the gloom and registering an exquisitely incisive winner.If it hardly bodes well for Bruce that the chaotic preamble to that goal involved him screaming ‘what the fuck’s happening’ as his new Netherlands left-back, Jetro Willems, replaced Jonjo Shelvey and immediately began charging around in midfield, these are very early days.Willems was meant to step in at left wing-back but it transpired that tactical instructions were lost in translation and he did not realise Matt Ritchie was shifting positions to assume Shelvey’s old central role.Two minutes after order was finally restored, the Eintracht Frankfurt loanee proved the victim of another misunderstanding, with Paul Dummett this time, before his surrender of possession prefaced an anti-climatic defeat.Bruce’s pain was only exacerbated by the reality that Unai Emery’s supposedly vulnerable, and hardly full strength, backline managed that real north Londoner’s collector’s item, a rare clean sheet on the road, on a day when a starting frontline missing both the £72m Pepe and Alexandre Lacazette created very little of note. At least the sight of the watching Andy Carroll keeping his ponytail dry with a baseball cap emblazoned with the word ‘Icon’ hinted at the prospect of potentially better days ahead but unfortunately for Newcastle, their newly returned, local attacking hero is injured – yet again. Admittedly there were some tantalising Miguel Almiron cameos, redolent with glittering promise but the undeniable absence of real ruthlessness in front of goal appeared suggestive of a long, hard, slog ahead.In mitigation, Bruce’s players arguably had the better of things until injury concerns necessitated the withdrawal of first Shelvey and then Sean Longstaff from central midfield and they, fatally, lost shape. That reshuffle also cut the supply lines to Joelinton, Bruce’s marquee £40m Brazilian attacking signing from Hoffenheim whose debut proved as quiet as a young Arsenal XI’s opening half.If Emery’s side felt unsettled by the security issues which dictated that Mesut Özil and Sead Kolasinac did not board the flight to north east, their hosts seemed to derive a measure of reassurance from the reasonably secure looking 3-5-2 framework within which Bruce had initially configured them.That structure proved sufficiently robust to keep the score goalless at half time on a day when Mike Ashley, Newcastle’s owner, will have been fairly satisfied to note that a proposed boycott of the game on the part of supporters variously dismayed by Rafael Benítez’s departure, his stewardship of the club and Bruce’s appointment fell more than a little flat.Almost 48,000 still filed into the 52,000 capacity stadium while a pre kick-off protest march from Ashley’s Sports Direct in the nearby city centre to the ground attracted only around 300 dissenting fans.They missed the sight of Bernd Leno making a smart one handed save to prevent Joelinton scoring and the important Isaac Hayden interception which possibly denied Henrikh Mkhitaryan a goal.Bruce will have been might relieved to see Mkhitaryan curl an extremely inviting opening wastefully off target but gratified by both his team’s initial strength down the left and his new public’s early generosity of spirit towards him.Significantly Benítez’s successor was the recipient of warm applause as he, rather niftily, subdued a dropping stray ball with a heel as it flew into the technical area. It would ultimately prove a rare highlight but Mkhitaryan’s lack of similar assurance on a day when the often wayward Armenian provoked frequent frustration as he almost palpably struggled to settle into any sort of passing groove seemed to be playing into Bruce’s hands. Tellingly. Emery looked disgruntled with far more than the raindrops beating down on the tightly pulled hood of his Arsenal anorak.The moment had arrived for Aubameyang to issue a reminder that his presence, alone, is often sufficient to undo teams by beginning his pursuit of another golden boot in the most convincing fashion.His 33rd goal in 50 Premier League appearances began with Dummett’s slapdash pass selling Willems horribly short and enabling Ainsley Maitland-Niles to seize possession and advance down the right before picking Aubameyang out with a luscious ball which removed Jamaal Lascelles from the defensive equation.What followed from Aubameyang was an amalgam of adhesive control, technical excellence and exquisite incision all in the space of two touches. With his first, the Gabon striker tamed the dropping delivery and, with the second, he dinked a cushioned half volley over Martin Dubravka, his boot connecting at precisely the right moment as the ball bounced back up off the turf. Arsenal’s season has lift-off, but Bruce is contemplating ignition problems."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7406ba337e4f55aa4199c1a954f00339cb04e3db/0_51_1876_1126/master/1876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f0334d362b64f7c5cd30d830e89479f","title":"manchester united v chelsea premier league live","story":"Two goals from Marcus Rashford, and one each from Anthony Martial and Daniel James, gave Ole Solskjaer’s side a rousing, if flattering, victory over ChelseaI’ll leave you with Danny Taylor’s match report from Old TraffordThanks for your company - bye!“There were four mistakes for the goals, but we controlled major parts of the first half. We made a couple of poor decisions in the final third. We should have been ahead at half-time. Even at the start of the second half, I didn’t mind it, then two mistakes and we’re 3-0 down.“At 1-0 we were the better team. They’re a counter-attacking team – it’s a big strength of theirs, put it that way, and if you give them opportunities to run past you they will. They were absolutely clinical.“There are loads of lessons for us – we can’t make unforced errors at this level. But at the same time, it was nowhere near a 4-0. We have Rudiger and Willian not far away Callum and Ruben will be a bit longer than that. I don’t want that excuse, though. The team we put out was competing very well in the game. “The first thing I said to the players was that we have to be grown up about it, because it’s not nice. We’re Chelsea and we don’t losing 4-0 anywhere, but we have to accept that. We have to analyse the bad bits and correct them.”The Man of the Match is Harry Maguire“It’s a great start for myself and the team. We rode our luck a little bit in the first half – we gave them too many chances. There were a few nerves and we gave the ball away in dangerous areas. But I think we were a lot better in the second half, we controlled the game and thoroughly deserved the three points.“Our front three are so dangerous, on the break especially, and it was a convincing win in the end. Even at 3-0 and 4-0 we wanted a clean sheet we knew there were only two here last season. We need to make this place a fortress. It’s a good start, but we’re not getting carried away.”“We’ve finally put in a textbook Mourinho performance,” says Michael Simpson. “I’m sure he’ll have warm words upstairs after the game.”Ha, yes. This reminded me of some of those 4-0 wins at the start of the 2017-18 season: tight and nervous for most of the game, and then a blizzard of late, counter-attacking goals. “United weren’t great, and no doubt they will still get the worst write up of all 20 PL teams this weekend,” says Bob Baccalieri. “But they have scored four, kept a clean sheet, looked like they cared, and their ‘terrible’ summer transfer business has already borne some fruit. That is good enough for me.”Yes, I thought their attitude - which was such a problem at the end of last season - was excellent. Peep peep! Manchester United start their season with a rousing, if flattering, thrashing of Chelsea. Marcus Rashford scored twice, with Anthony Martial - back in his old role at No9 - and the substitute Daniel James getting the others. Paul Pogba was his usual self: exasperating at times, imperious and devastating at others. Chelsea started the game superbly and passed it well, but their shoddy defending was punished ruthlessly.90+1 min “Has there ever been more deceiving 4-0 lead than this one?” says Admir Pajic.In fairness, United’s performance in the last half-hour has been textbook: sit deep, give Chelsea’s passers no space and shred them on the counter-attack.90 min James is too fast even for Kante, who takes him out and is booked. It’s been a fine day for the United debutants - James has scored, Maguire has been as solid as his forehead and Wan-Bissaka, though erratic, has done some impressive things.88 min “Hope you’re well,” says Ruth Purdue. “I’d love to have Jorginho in a 2 with McTominay. He’d keep the ball ticking over and thread balls through. I feel you need that type in that position rather than the marauding Pogba. The no 6 can play on the left of a midfield 3 when he has world class players around him. He seems not to be as consistent without a Kante, Pirlo or Matuidi. I realise I write this after that Pogba run. Any thoughts?”They would complement each other, definitely. It’s the PirloGattuso model that Sir Alex Ferguson loved so much. But Pogba has been majestic at times in this game.87 min After a good cross from Wan-Bissaka, Greenwood’s first-time shot is blocked.86 min A double change for United: Juan Mata and Mason Greenwood replace the impressive pair of Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard. Beans. 85 min Mount hits a cracking low shot from distance that is well saved by de Gea, sprawling to his right. As Gary Neville says on Sky, he’s had a good day. A clean sheet would mean so much to him and the whole team, given the way they defended last season.83 min “Is the scoreline a travesty?” says Christopher Faherty. “Chelsea have dominated the ball at spells and made chances but they’ve looked an open book at the back from the start of the game.”It was another superb counter-attack. Pogba played a one-two with Martial and surged majestically over the halfway line, beyond the defence. As Chelsea players started to catch him up, he looked up and angled a pass through to James in the area. He overran the ball slightly but recovered to hit a shot that deflected off Emerson and beat Kepa.Daniel James scores on his debut!81 min McTominay is booked for something or other. There have been a lot of yellow cards today, although I can’t remember any bad tackles.80 min United almost get a fourth on the counter-attack. Pogba eases a long pass forward to Rashford, who cuts inside Azpilicueta on the edge of the area and hits a shot that is blocked by Kante.76 min It’s been a strange game. Chelsea have had more possession, more shots, more shots on target, more corners, fewer fouls. But they’re 3-0 down, and no xG analysis in the world will make them feel better.73 min A change for each side: Kante replaces Jorginho, and the debutant Daniel James comes on for Andreas Pereira.72 min Although this scoreline is a travesty, it’s a reminder of how dangerous this United team can be on the counter-attack, both through the running of Rashford, Martial and Lingard and the passing of Pogba.72 min It was Lindelof who was booked in the 69th minute, not McTominay.71 min Zouma heads over the bar Emerson has another shot from distance saved by de Gea.69 min McTominay is booked for a foul on Kovacic.68 min Between those goals, Tammy Abraham was replaced by Olivier Giroud.That was an expertly taken goal. Pogba, just inside his own half, sprayed a brilliant pass over the top to find Rashford, who made a sharp run infield away from Azpilicueta. He killed the ball beautifully with his instep, just outside the area, and passed it to the left of Kepa.Two goals in 90 seconds!The goal came on the counter-attack after Maguire robbed Abraham on the edge of the box. Rashford overhit an angled through pass to Lingard, who retrieved the ball on the right of the area and eased it to Pereira on the wing. He whipped a wicked cross into the six-yard box, where Martial got in front of Azpilicueta and forced the ball through Kepa.64 min Chelsea haven’t been as threatening in the last 10 minutes, though they are still dominating possession. If it stays like, Daniel James or Mason Greenwood will surely come on for United.62 min Pereira hangs the corner up towards Maguire, who wins it at the far post but can only head it back across goal. Chelsea clear.62 min Martial tries to wriggle away from Zouma, who runs the ball behind for a United corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e321d2702f2a582bf631935c740829e05fb59d5/0_233_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2ff06f21c0cf8efa09192519ff3958","title":"five ways to look after your joints","story":"It’s not all about stretching. Varied exercise, good posture and changing your diet can help you stay nimbleEssentially, the heavier you are, the greater the impact on the joints and the stronger the muscles have to be to control movements, explains Laura Jamieson, a chartered physiotherapist. Ensuring that muscle-mass percentage is higher than body-fat percentage is crucial to maintaining muscle strength, which helps to ensure you move well. Registered dietitian Sue Baic, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, breaks it down: “For every 0.5kg (1lb) lost, we reduce the weight going through the knee joint at each step by 2kg (4.5lb).” Excess body fat, especially around the abdomen, is also inflammatory, making any osteoarthritis symptoms worse.“A common misconception is that people think exercise will aggravate joint pain,” says Giles Stafford, a consultant orthopaedic hip surgeon at the Wellington Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare UK. But strengthening the muscles around joints is important, says Stafford, especially if you have any issues with them, as it will minimise the pressure on them. Hip problems, for example, can be improved or even prevented by maintaining a good functional range of motion and muscle strength. Stafford recommends body weight exercises such as squats and lunges, and light dumbbell exercises such as bicep curls.When it comes to exercise, variety is key. Jamieson recommends a mixture of impact and non-impact cardio for good bone density and strength training (ensuring guidance is sought for correct technique). Yoga can help maintain good mobility but Jamieson says to combine it with other forms of exercise.Stafford warns against over-stretching: “It can take the joint past its natural physiological range, which can cause damage to the joint and surrounding structures.”“Some recent research has suggested that diets high in saturated fat – found in fatty meats and meat products, full-fat dairy, cakes, biscuits, butter and coconut oil – can weaken the cartilage in the knee and hip so that it is more prone to damage and loss of cushioning,” says Baic. She recommends a Mediterranean-style diet, higher in monounsaturated fats such as olive or rapeseed oil, with plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and seeds. As omega-3 fat is anti-inflammatory, Baic suggests one to two servings of oily fish each week (or in the recommended dose if taken in oil form). Also pay attention to your vitamin D levels, which are crucial for bone development: it is believed one in five people in the UK have low levels.Maintaining good posture is key to preventing joint issues, says Jamieson. “You want to be very careful of your back particularly: there is no surgery that will replace your discs or spine yet.” The NHS publishes an online guide tackling common posture mistakes. It is also important to wear the correct, supportive footwear for exercises and activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92de10aba8bdb5d8f8be698602e8165478a4e23d/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d863927252d17a6be0563346799655a6","title":"indoor plant sales boom reflecting urbanisation and design trends","story":"Millennials’ desire to nurture and care for something also contribute to riseIndoor plants sales are booming as a result of urbanisation, interior design trends and millennials’ desire to have something to nurture and care for.According to experts, the rise in sales of indoor plants and plant accessories, as well as the prominence of Instagram influencers – social media personalities with tens of thousands of followers – speaks to a growing trend among young people.When George Hudson, 24, moved to London from Derbyshire to start a politics degree, he missed the green spaces he had grown up in. He started work in Walworth Garden, which let him reconnect with nature from there, his fascination with house plants grew and he now owns about a dozen.“It’s partly a back-to-nature thing, a relief from the developed cities we live in,” he said. “It also gives people something to look after and care for something people crave. There is a bit of a collector’s addiction about it.”Freddie Blackett, Patch’s founder, said it was hard to pin a date on when the trend started. “Urbanisation is a big driver,” he said. “People are increasingly living in tight spaces in increasingly tight cities so access to nature is much reduced.”Blackett said the physical and mental health benefits of plants were also a draw as indoor plants help clean the air and are said to ease depression and anxiety. Another change had been design trends, he said. “We have seen people move away from stark minimalism.”Ali Edwards, the design manager at Made, said there had been a big trend for wellness within the home. “We’ve seen a rise in popularity of calming furnishings like woven rattans and spherical lighting,” she said.Alice Vincent, an author and journalist who runs an Instagram account with thousands of followers dedicated to plants, said there was something more meaningful going on for younger people. “Millennials don’t have the housing and security our parents had. We grow up slower and that does not mean we don’t want to connect, have something to nurture,” she said.Vincent noted that house plants had gone in and out of favour for decades. “In the Victorian era, they were very fascinated with them … Fast forward again and in the 1970s there was a huge proliferation in house plants. We are taking up the mantle again and you see it reflected in the fact everyone likes mid-century stylings, and interiors … and so plants are part and parcel with that.”Jamie Song, whose Instagram account Jamie’s Jungle has 201,000 followers, described the growth as an “explosion”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cf4829ac5134f4661a0f050874f5724185bd789/731_706_4818_2891/master/4818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3206d2fa8638b7401de648081d812f3","title":"sunday with ian rankin i always worry when i start writing itll be no good ","story":"The crime writer on unread books and bright ideasWhat’s the first thing you see when you wake up?

Breakfast is at the flat, porridge and berries. I’m not much of a chef. There’s only breakfast in bed for my wife on Christmas and birthdays. But I do go and fetch the coffee.Are Sundays for work or pleasure? If I’m writing a book, Sunday is just another day. I’ll be writing seven days a week. It’s not always a day of rest. If I’m not working, Sundays are when the family gets together. When I was young, family was what Sundays were all about. Now, at 59, I still cling to that.Worst Sunday habit? Worrying about Monday.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.If parliament passed a motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson’s government, the plan would be for them to form a temporary cabinet, existing only to propose a Brexit referendum, likely to be remain versus no deal.The move by Lucas is the first public offer to Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP, as well as Tory rebels, detailing who would lead a potential government of national unity and how it could be constituted with the explicit aim of delivering a referendum.The move is likely to have a mixed reception in Westminster from some leading figures coordinating the anti-no deal planning in parliament, several of whom are not in favour of a second referendum, including Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles.Labour has ruled out backing a replacement government not led by Jeremy Corbyn, limiting the chances that the plan could succeed. Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, appears unlikely to back such a move.Lucas, who is understood to have begun talks with the women she has addressed in her open letter, sent the offer to Thornberry, Swinson, Greening and Sturgeon, as well as the Change UK MP Anna Soubry, the independent MP Heidi Allen, the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman, the independent Northern Irish MP Sylvia Hermon and Plaid Cymru’s Liz Saville Roberts.The final MP who has been approached is Yvette Cooper, one of the leading Labour figures coordinating efforts to stop no deal, but the only one of the addressees who has not explicitly endorsed a second referendum herself.Lucas, the former Green party leader who is her party’s only MP, wrote: “It is hard to remember a moment in my lifetime when Britain faced a greater crisis. A coup led by a small group of rightwing libertarians is all but complete, as the Vote Leave team has been reassembled and taken control of 10 Downing Street.“They are set upon implementing the most extreme no-deal version of Brexit – and, most terrifyingly, we are running out of time to stop them.”Lucas said she believed a cabinet of women from across the political spectrum would be best placed to set up an “emergency cabinet” which she said would “work for reconciliation” rather than fight new political battles.“Why women? Because I believe women have shown they can bring a different perspective to crises, are able to reach out to those they disagree with and cooperate to find solutions,” she wrote.“It was two women who began the Peace People movement during the worst of the troubles in Northern Ireland it was two women who were key to the signing of the Paris agreement on climate difficult, intractable problems have found the beginning of resolution thanks to the leadership of women.”Soubry said she had been in contact with Lucas over the idea, but had some reservations: “The very serious point is that people of different political views, who might profoundly disagree over some things, need to put their differences aside and work together to stop a no-deal Brexit. That is really important.“However, while I agree that women can do things in a different way, if you’re trying to stop no-deal Brexit then the key thing is to bring people together, not to ide them on the basis of their gender.”But Allen said she had signed up to the plan: “Caroline is right to draw the conclusion that often it’s us women who are prepared to get people round a table and work differently.“We are facing the precipice of no deal so we have to shed old ways of working, and fast. Women are by nature less tribal, so I’m very willing to play my part and try.”The date on which the Commons is likely to return from summer recess. It is the first date that MPs could hold a vote of no confidence in the new prime minister. However, rebel MPs would need to be confident they could form an alternative government, as many wish to avoid triggering an election.Mps would be due to go on conference recess - but could continue to sit if a no-confidence vote had been lost.Assuming the government has lost a confidence vote, this would be the deadline for Labour or any unity government to win a confidence vote. If not achieved, Boris Johnson would call an election. Parliament could then be prorogued.The Labour and Conservative party conferences are due to be held on consecutive weeks.Parliament would be dissolved if an election were to be held on 1 November.\u0026nbspEU leaders meet for the final European council summit before the UK\u0027s extension is due to expire. Rebel Tories and remainers may choose to call a no-confidence vote if an extension is not offered as a way of preventing no deal.The six-month article 50 extension will expire.The UK could hold a general election.In her letter, Lucas argued she did not accept that such an arrangement risked being an anti-democratic stitch-up.The proposal was, she said, “not so that a small group of us decide on Britain’s future, but so that we end the dangerous pursuit of a crash-out Brexit and find a way forward which allows the British people to decide which course to take”.Lucas said the first course of action would be to defeat Johnson in a confidence vote with the immediate aim of forming a national unity government which would negotiate an extension to article 50 in order to hold a new referendum.That referendum would give voters the option to choose between remain and “the latest government plan”. Lucas said that could include a revised withdrawal agreement, should Johnson have produced one, but accepted it was “more likely” that the alternative would be to leave with no deal.Lucas said those forming the new government would commit to “accept the outcome of that fair, transparent and informed vote, even if it delivers a result we do not agree with”, implying the temporary government would then dissolve.“I believe we can make this happen,” she wrote. “I’m asking you to meet with me in the coming days, so together we can transform the conversation about Brexit. So together we can find a positive way forward, revitalise our democracy and stand up to this government’s reckless gamble with Britain’s future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/662e35c63cbdbbe6575517228379e06eb8ac7922/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6fef9e725456d3cddab671e9896400b","title":"snp scotland independence referendum brexit","story":"Boris Johnson’s do-or-die Brexit has pushed even reluctant Scots into the pro-independence camp, among the voters in one bellwether townWhen Boris Johnson, as editor of the Spectator, published a poem in 2004 calling the Scots a “verminous race” that deserved “comprehensive extermination”, he may not have imagined it could come back to haunt him 15 years later in his first weeks as prime minister.“The Scotch – what a verminous race!” begins Friendly Fire by James Michie. “Canny, pushy, chippy, they’re all over the place  Battening off us with false bonhomie  Polluting our stock, undermining our economy.”The purportedly satirical poem is no longer available on the Spectator’s website, but it is remembered with cold fury by some in the fractured, but relatively conservative market town of Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. “If you’re at the receiving end to being likened to vermin, you’re not impressed,” Rae Jardine, a local Scottish Nationalist party member, said with restraint.Jardine was speaking last week just after an opinion poll showed the first lead for an independent Scotland for more than two years, and shortly before shadow chancellor John McDonnell triggered a row by saying his party would allow a second independence referendum north of the border if Labour was in government.Indeed, these twin factors, Johnson and a hard Brexit, could be a tipping point which threatens the very survival of the United Kingdom.In Inverurie, Andrew Jenkins voted No to an independent Scotland in 2014 but is now tilting reluctantly towards Yes. “I wouldn’t like Brexit and Johnson to change my mind but it may well do,” he said. If there was a referendum in the next couple of years, “it would certainly be a more difficult choice this time than last time”.About 17 miles northwest of Aberdeen, Inverurie is a quietly prosperous town, cleaving to tradition, resistant to upheaval. Its population is growing there are jobs to be had in the dominant industries of agriculture, oil and gas crime and antisocial behaviour are rare house prices and rents are high, pushed up by demand. The town lies in what has been a Lib Dem-Tory marginal constituency.In the past five years, the public here has gone to the polls six times against the backdrop of an increasingly complex and turbulent political landscape. After Scottish, UK (twice) and European elections plus two referendums, the broad-brush picture is a place opposed to both independence and Brexit, and see-sawing between the Tories and the Nationalists.In the first of those votes, the 2014 referendum, Aberdeenshire voted 60-40 against independence. Yet the following year, Alex Salmond, the former leader of the SNP and first minister, took the Westminster seat of Gordon, in which Inverurie sits.Although many people are reticent about discussing politics, the underlying mood is “extremely isive”, according to a local Conservative official. One lunchtime customer in the Gordon Highlander pub said he was staunchly pro-Union but declined to give his name in case he got “a brick through the window” from the nationalists. Johnson, he warned, was “manna from heaven for Nicola Sturgeon”, the SNP leader and first minister.Clark, the local MP and now a Scottish minister in Johnson’s government, flatly rejected such a notion. “Boris is a hugely popular figure, full stop, because he connects with the general public. People understand what Boris is on about. The press has tried to paint him as being isive.“Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP and the press in Scotland have poured out this bile that he’s somehow anti-Scottish, but people need to judge him as prime minister by what he achieves.” He will, Clark added, “make all of the United Kingdom prosperous”.At least two reports have suggested otherwise. In 2017, the Centre for Cities thinktank concluded that Aberdeen would be the UK city most adversely affected by Brexit, especially a hard exit, mainly due to the impact of increasing costs in the oil sector.Even Clark – generally an enthusiast for Johnsonian positive thinking – conceded that agriculture, especially sheep farming, could be in for “a headache”.John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde university and the UK’s foremost poll analyst, said the Ashcroft survey was “of a piece” with four other Scottish opinion polls conducted earlier this year. “It is further evidence that seemingly the race has narrowed. The figures reflect exactly what voters said they would do if Boris Johnson became prime minister and if the UK crashed out of Europe. One of those things has happened, and the other is coming into view.”Another analyst, Michael Keating, chair in Scottish politics at Aberdeen university, said the country “may be approaching a tipping point. Certainly, the union is looking a lot weaker than it was coming out of the 2014 referendum”.As with the Leave-Remain balance across the UK, demographics may be a factor. Some say older voters tend to be more pro-union young people coming into the electorate tend to be more open to independence. And, in Scotland in 2014, 16-year-olds were permitted to vote.Gillian Martin, the SNP’s MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said she had detected a shift in mood among her constituents. “Everyone I know knows someone who’s changed their mind from No to Yes. Of course, not everyone is champing at the bit to have another referendum – people are weary of the amount of times they’ve been asked to go to the ballot box in the past few years.She insisted the SNP has never been about “blood and soil nationalism. We want self-government, self-determination. We’re not interested in Trumpian, build-the-wall nationalism. We want open-the-doors, progressive internationalism. But we want for Scotland all the powers that other nations enjoy.”In 2014, the No campaign was boosted by Gordon Brown’s powerful interventions, making the case for solidarity between nations. Five years on, the former prime minister is still a forceful advocate of the union, arguing in the pages of this newspaper today that, “to prevent the rise and rise of dysfunctional nationalism the first step is to stop No Deal in its tracks”.Brown recently warned that Johnson could be the UK’s last prime minister, saying “no matter what he may say now, two decades of anti-Scottish invective will come back to haunt him”.Brexit had “created a new dimension to the debate,” Brown told the Observer last week. “Two forces are coming together – Boris Johnson being seen as hostile to Scottish aspirations, and Scotland voting against Brexit in the referendum. So the future of the union has moved centre stage, and it’s got to be taken into account now in what decisions governments make.”The “descent into nationalism across the UK is a worrying feature”, he said. “But people have not heard what the true consequences of independence for Scotland actually are”. The SNP was in favour of “a hard independence as opposed to a soft independence”, which would result in a “decade of hyper-austerity”. And the Conservatives only had “a negative message, a holding operation for the union”.He added: “I’ve always argued you need to put the positive case for Scotland staying in Britain, to lead in Britain rather than leave Britain. I will keep fighting, all the time I have, for Britain to stay in the European Union and for Britain to maintain its connections with Europe.“I will also fight for the idea of a multinational state, which is what Britain is. And I’m optimistic about young people in this country, who don’t see that you’ve got to make a choice between being Scottish or British, or between being British and European. The idea that we’re all islands separated off from each other does not make sense. So I won’t give up on these ideas.”In Inverurie’s market square, most of those willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But they may not be representative. Many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the union. Danny Henderson said he voted No in 2014 but now would vote Yes “if they had the basic questions sorted”, including “money and the currency question”, healthcare provision and the armed forces.Rory Pearce, a teacher originally from Northern Ireland, declared himself pro-Europe and pro-independence. “I’m in favour of independence for Northern Ireland too, and I hope Scotland will be a stepping stone to that. “The break-up of the UK is definitely more likely now. Johnson is hellbent on no deal. So let Scotland decide its own future.”The introduction of Margaret Thatcher’s deeply unpopular poll tax lead to mass demonstrations in Scotland and helps revive the independence movement.Tony Blair promises devolution for Scotland. A referendum backs a Scottish parliament with tax-raising powers. In 1998 the Scottish Act assigns devolved powers to a 129-member Scottish parliament, elected in 1999. Labour wins 56 seats, SNP 35 seats, Conservatives 18, Lib Dems 17.The SNP wins a majority in the Scottish parliament and Alex Salmond, left, becomes first minister. The following year, the Edinburgh Agreement is signed by Salmond and UK prime minister David Cameron, paving the way for a referendum on Scottish independence.Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, pledging to take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal. An opinion poll shows a small lead among Scots in favour of independence amid talk of a break-up of the UK. Shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, says Labour would allow another referendum if in power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b48db6f89431279d30991a57789349445d85fb9/1394_1338_14133_8478/master/14133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8821ebe5d54feee0243c3b9cd9011afe","title":"can we stop americas teen vaping epidemic arriving in britain ","story":"Despite being aimed at mature smokers, ‘Juuling’ among teenagers is on the rise as they are drawn to the sweet flavours and sleek design. By February, almost 5 million American high-schoolers were vaping. So how can we stop British teens from becoming addicted, too?At Grace’s school, it doesn’t matter if you’re the coolest girl in the class or the quietest, when you get up to go to the toilet, you take your Juul. It doesn’t matter if you’re 11 or 16, like Grace was when she first started smoking the sleek black electronic cigarette. Depending on your gender, you’ll tuck the USB-like device into your pocket or your bra, knowingly risking suspension for a hit of mango- flavoured nicotine. Last year, Grace’s school implemented a new policy: if two kids go to the toilet at the same time, they’re automatically assumed to be Juuling.“It does impact people in school,” says Grace, now 17, who, like all the teenagers in this piece, has had her name changed to protect her identity. Grace is originally from England but attends a private school in Switzerland. “You’ve got kids getting up every five minutes to go to the bathroom because you can’t focus without a hit.”You must be 18 or over to purchase vaping products in the United States, the United Kingdom and most of Europe, but that hasn’t prevented what the US Surgeon General last year called a “teen vaping epidemic”. In February 2019, America’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 4.9m teens in the country used e-cigarettes. In July, Juul’s CEO Kevin Burns apologised to parents for the first time. “I’m sorry their child is using the product,” he said. “It’s not intended for them.”Grace and her classmates (who are mostly English, though some are American) think Juul was intended for them. “It’s just too convenient,” the teenager says. “Other brands of vapes are like huge, billowing smoke – you can’t hide that.” There are now a number of e-cigarettes and vape pens on the market, from those with bulky, refillable tanks like Aspire, to the thin black e-cigarette Blu. Yet Juul captured teen imagination – Grace says its discreet size means it is easily kept out of sight. “So I do think they knew what they were doing.”An American spokesperson denies Juul was ever intended for teenagers and says the product “was designed and developed exclusively with the adult smoker in mind,” adding: “We don’t want anyone who doesn’t smoke or already uses nicotine to use Juul products.” The reason the product is so sleek and small, they say, is to make the experience of switching from cigarettes “as simple, clean and satisfying” as possible.“We’ve created a product with no buttons or switches, no cleaning or messy juice replacement, as seen in most other vapes with open systems. It’s clean, freeing the adult smoker from smoke, ash and odour that they would usually get from a combustible cigarettes, and most importantly it’s satisfying, using regulated temperature controls, nicotine salts and varying strengths to meet the needs of cigarette smokers looking to switch.”When Juul launched its first marketing campaigns in 2015, the models in its brightly coloured posters looked young, fresh and cool. America’s Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating whether the company deliberately marketed its products towards young people, something Juul denies. After its UK launch in summer 2018, the brand has steered away from a youth-oriented image. All of the models in Juul ads are now over 30 and users of the product, and the company’s upcoming UK billboards will be 200m away from any schools. Juul UK’s managing director, Dan Thomson, emphasises that this is double the official guidance of 100m.“We are switching people in very significant numbers away from combustible cigarettes,” says Thomson, who has worked with the brand for just over a year. When Juul debuted in the UK last July, its products were available in just a few hundred vape stores. They are now sold in nearly 10,000 outlets. Many Britons, who had been ordering Juul from abroad, were excited that the product was finally available at an affordable price at home. On social media, customers declared it “a dream come true” and “amazing” when, in November 2018, the company struck a major deal with Sainsbury’s.“We are still relatively small in this marketplace,” Thomson says. “There are still millions of smokers out there who are going to have very negative health outcomes if they do not either quit completely – which is what we would recommend – or find an alternative to switch to. In a careful and thoughtful way, and in a way that ensures the product does not get into the wrong hands, we want to continue to expand.”“There is widespread academic and clinical consensus that while not without risk, vaping is far less harmful than smoking,” says Professor John Newton, director of health improvement at Public Health England. “There is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping. The sooner you stop smoking completely the better.”“There are concerns about exposure to nicotine at an early stage of life,” says Maciej Goniewicz, a scientist at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in New York. Last year, Goniewicz and his colleagues published a study that found that adolescents who use Juul are exposed to nearly as much nicotine as traditional smokers, owing to the product’s use of nicotine salts. “Young people who never smoked are getting this highly effective nicotine-delivery product, and they might get addicted,” Goniewicz says. He also emphasises that we don’t yet know the long-term effects of e-cigarettes. “Even though there is a consensus that e-cigarettes are less risky than tobacco cigarettes, we still see evidence that there is some respiratory cardiovascular risk associated with vaping,” he says.In 2015, researchers found that some e-cigarette flavours contain a chemical, diacetyl, which has been linked to “popcorn lung”, a disease characterised by irreversibly inflamed airways. Juul does not use diacetyl as an ingredient, but many teens like Grace use off-brand vape juice in their Juuls because it’s cheaper.“Yeaaaah,” Grace muses when asked if she’s concerned about the effect vaping will have on her health. “But, I don’t know. It’s difficult, because obviously I don’t want to have health problems in the future. But I know that it’s a possibility. And if that does happen, if I end up with a lung condition, which is definitely possible, it’s my own fault.”A straight-A student interested in extracurricular activities and charity work, Grace understands the risks of vaping. So why does she do it anyway, and how did Juuling get so cool? Over the past year, Grace has supervised school dances for younger kids. At one event for 11 to 13-year-olds, one of her key duties was to stop children vaping in the loos. “Obviously the flavours make it appealing,” says Grace, who spends roughly £24 a week on Juul pods. Pods come in sweet flavours like creme, mint and cucumber. Grace’s favourite used to be mango (“Like, traditional,” she says), but she now buys knock-off flavours including strawberry, watermelon and pineapple.In response to criticism about youth uptake, Juul stopped selling sweet and fruit-flavoured pods in US high-street shops in November 2018 (the flavours are still available online, where customers must be over 21 and verify their age by submitting ID). Yet in the UK, mango and mint-flavoured pods are still available nationwide.“I know there has been some talk of flavours. We only have six flavours in the UK,” says Thomson. “We are very conservative in the flavour choices. We are very conservative in the flavour name descriptions that we have.”Of course it’s not just flavours that make Juul appealing to teens, especially once they’re already addicted. “It is not about the flavours. I can’t stress that enough,” says Andy, a 17-year-old high school student and former vape dealer from Atlanta. “They are trying to ban mango and all of that. That does not matter, we will just buy the next flavour… When they run out of their favourite flavour, all of a sudden the one that they hated is looking pretty good to them because they are addicted.”Andy began Juuling when he was 15 and, like Grace, attributes his addiction to good old-fashioned peer pressure. “I had a friend who didn’t do it, but my friends would just about harass them to try it,” he says. Both Grace and Andy say Juuling provides stress relief, especially before exams. As he is 6ft 7in and looks mature, Andy was able to buy Juul pods from local shops and sell them on to his classmates. “Every day after school I would have 20 or 30 people meeting me at my truck for pods,” he says, estimating that he made nearly $4,000 in a year.Another reason teens became hooked on these pods, experts argue, is because of Juul’s social media presence. Last year, Juul shut down its Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts, and promised to use its Twitter for “non-promotional communications only”. Yet many feared it was too late: teens had already set up their own Juul-based accounts, sharing tricks, memes and jokes, ensuring that Juuling remained a somewhat ironic, but nonetheless addictive, hobby.“You get a buzz off it, definitely… But it is also just like a fun thing to do. You’ve got like your tricks and stuff,” explains Grace.“Teens who are not necessarily signing up to follow Juul and Juul-related media are exposed to it on the social media platform,” Allem says. “In our research and in the literature in general, we know that young people who are exposed to tobacco marketing, nicotine marketing, it raises awareness of the brand, and it changes susceptibility to use such products… Moving forward, the more Juul can do to remove their content from platforms that are popular among young people, the better.”And yet as quickly as it rose to power, Juul’s popularity is already declining among American teens. In May 2018, the New Yorker chronicled “the promise of vaping and the rise of Juul”, but by November, they released a declaratively titled follow-up, “Goodbye to Juul season”. Meme-based Juul Instagram accounts were disappearing rapidly, the story announced, and teens suggested the trend was disappearing. Andy has already cut down on his personal use, and no longer sells pods.“I personally do not like Juul any more. I do not like the whole company,” says Andy. “I don’t like what it has done to me.” He does athletics and believes his race times would be better if he had never Juuled. When asked how Juuling has affected classmates, he says: “They are after pods like fools.”“As we launched the business in the UK, front and centre of our strategy was ensuring that we did not replicate some of the earlier issues that we saw in the US,” Thomson says. Juul’s strict measures in the UK include a “Challenge 25” policy in all retail stores no UK social media accounts underage mystery shoppers sanctions against stockists who don’t meet age-verification standards and only using adult smokers in its advertising.“I think the policies are working,” Thomson says. “I think the policies are above and beyond any other age-gated brand in almost any other sector.”British teens don’t really seem to care about Juul – I am variously told that “people tend to go for cheaper vapes off Amazon” “Juul is primarily a meme”, and “Vapes are usually in year seven – people start smoking weed higher up.” Yet without this extremely lucrative market, and with bans and regulations making life harder for adult Juulers (who now have to buy flavours online in the States, and deal with a lower nicotine content in the UK) will Juul continue to grow?“If you look at the numbers over the last few years, the number of people switching from smoking to vaping has started to flatten out. I think part of that is a lot of misinformation that surrounds the health impacts of switching,” Thomson says. “I hope that the government, charities and public health bodies continue to be supportive because there is a huge public health opportunity in front of them. There are a 100,000 people who die every year in this country from smoking cigarettes.” Juul is currently fighting the San Francisco ban, instead pushing regulation and enforcement as an alternative.For many former smokers, Juul is undoubtedly a lifeline. But for teens such as Grace, vaping is an expensive and potentially dangerous new addiction. The 17-year-old has no plans to stop. “A few kids quit, but they normally end up back on it within a week or so, just because so many people are doing it,” she says. “It’s hard to avoid.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ad5a3eb9c3185cfed52f02b8c64660a0ab693b3/0_248_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d13d43b0f60dc41d543220e6c12f88d8","title":"lq and bnp paribas partner up to get tenants back into work","story":"L\u0026ampQ social housing association secured loan by BNP Paribas under condition it helped its unemployed residents find jobsFor a couple of years Nontando Mpofu, known to her friends as Lucy, struggled to find permanent work and often found herself reliant on the generosity of her church and food bank.“Life was a real struggle, and it was very hard for me to juggle everything – paying the rent and looking after my daughter as a single parent,” Mpofu, 40, says in the airy kitchen of her flat in Leytonstone, east London. “I got into quite a bit of debt and rent arrears.”Mpofu’s life changed last November when an unlikely alliance between France’s biggest bank and her social housing landlord helped get her back into permanent work with a job at Marks \u0026amp Spencer, and get her bank account into the black. “I was just scrolling through Facebook one day, and I saw a post from someone in the community saying: ‘If you’ve been unemployed for six months – get in touch, we can help’.”The message had been posted by a support officer employed by her landlord London \u0026amp Quadrant (L\u0026ampQ) , one of the UK’s largest housing associations which rents out close to 100,000 homes in London and the south-east. L\u0026ampQ employs more than a dozen people dedicated to getting its long-term unemployed residents such as Mpofu into permanent jobs.The team of support workers helped Mpofu perfect her CV, coached her through mock interviews, and helped her identify jobs suitable to her skills and circumstances. The L\u0026ampQ team also helps unemployed residents with buying clothes to wear to interviews and paying for travel.Matthew Corbett, the director of the L\u0026ampQ foundation, said the housing association was committed to helping its tenants into work because “it makes our communities happy and healthier” but also because L\u0026ampQ is contractually obliged to by its bank, BNP Paribas.France’s biggest bank loaned L\u0026ampQ £100m at a discount rate on the condition that the housing association helped at least 600 of its residents into work. BNP Paribas and L\u0026ampQ were unable to state how big the discount is, but Corbett said it was significant and would free up more money for the housing association to invest in its foundation.L\u0026ampQ, which was founded by a Church of England priest in 1963, smashed the target of getting 600 residents into work, and the loan will be extended for four years with L\u0026ampQ required to increase its job search effort by an additional 25 people each year. Accountants at PwC will audit L\u0026ampQ to verify that the housing association really achieved the target, which built upon its existing efforts to get residents into work.Social housing residents are twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the UK population on average, according to research by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). Those who are in work are likely to be low-paid and in part-time jobs. The average weekly pay for housing association tenants is £250, compared to £232 for local authority tenants, £348 for private renters and £454 for owner-occupiers.Waqar Ahmed, L\u0026ampQ’s finance director, said: “Everything that L\u0026ampQ does begins with social purpose, and we believe that no one should be denied the opportunity to achieve their potential because of where they live.“BNP Paribas is exactly the sort of partner we are looking for, and we are delighted to have completed this ground-breaking deal with them. The team at BNP Paribas share our sense of social purpose, and our combined vision is going to help hundreds more people into employment every year.”BNP Paribas said the idea to offer the discount “sustainability-linked” loan came about after the bank’s change to its corporate social responsibility policy to do more to “create a positive impact in society”.Simon Gates, a senior banker at BNP Paribas UK, said the deal was the first to tie the terms of a loan to efforts to reduce unemployment. “It is the result of close collaboration to conceptualise and structure what represents a landmark deal for sustainable finance in the UK: to our knowledge, this is the first ever UK housing association loan that incorporates a concrete, positive impact metric.“L\u0026ampQ will be assessed on the actual impact realised in the community in terms of helping residents back to work. We think this is a watershed moment and we are honoured to support L\u0026ampQ as it continues its essential work of building affordable, high-quality homes.”After the success of the deal with L\u0026ampQ, BNP Paribas signed a similar deal this week with Optivo, another housing association which owns 47,000 homes occupied by close to 100,000 people. Gates said the Optivo loan was “about getting people back into work, which is good for iniduals, families, the economy and society”.David Reynolds, the BNP Paribas banker who agreed the deal, said the French bank saw it as part of its “responsibility to align financing to reward worthy causes”.“From the top down, we are really focused on the positive impact banking can have,” he said. “It’s important for us to show that we support these sort of causes that are doing good for society.”Reynolds said the bank was putting aside a pool of money to support other social housing projects as well as other schemes aimed at improving the environment and cutting down on waste water.Greg Beales, the campaigns director of the housing charity Shelter, said it was important that banks such as BNP Paribas were making it easier for housing associations to build more homes particularly at a time of severe government cuts. “This shows the private sector stepping in to provide finance when the public finances have been incredible stretched,” he said.“Homes can help do so much more social good than just simply providing housing: they act as a platform from which people can improve their whole lives.”The terms of the Optivo loan have not been disclosed due to commercial sensitivity, but it is understood that the target will call on the housing association to significantly build on the approximately 1,000 residents a year it currently helps into work.On the frontlines helping Optivo residents find work are 17 Give Us a Chance employment specialists including Whitney Henry.Henry, who got her job through the same programme, said the most important aspect of her work was to give other residents “the confidence to believe in themselves”.“Some people have been out of work for a long time, and they have lost some of that confidence and belief in themselves,” said Henry, who works with residents on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, one of the most deprived parts of the UK.Her personal target is to get 50 people a year into work. Last year she found jobs for 126, including every member of a family of four. The father secured a job as a school caretaker, the mother got part-time cleaning work in the school, the daughter took an IT course before getting a job at PC World, and her brother is studying the same course while working at Greggs.“It is so rewarding when they get into jobs,” Henry said. “It’s probably the best feeling in the world that you have helped them achieve, and you feel like you have achieved with them. I am so proud of all them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ab4af9e4a3430783601b47874116f2c7171c3c4/5_271_5729_3438/master/5729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ec2719fa64c599063768886154a5cd0","title":"menopausal women in the uk facing severe hrt shortage","story":"Half of common treatments out of stock, but suppliers not honest about reason, GPs sayA national shortage of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) could affect almost all menopausal women in the UK.Around half of the most commonly prescribed HRT products, which replace hormones including oestrogen that naturally decline during menopause, are out of stock.The high street pharmacies Boots and Lloyds are among those said to be experiencing shortages.The Department for Health and Social Care said it was aware of ongoing supply issues caused by manufacturing delays. A spokesperson said: “We are working closely with all suppliers to maintain overall flow of medicines to patients.“Supplies of alternative HRT products are available and any patient affected should discuss alternatives with their doctor.”The department initially became aware of the problem in December, but shortages have worsened in recent weeks.Lloyds’ supplier AAH Pharmaceuticals has run out of 15 of the 24 HRT brands it stocks, according to figures given to the Daily Mail. The pharmaceutical retailer Alliance, which is owned by the same group as Boots, has run out of nine of 27 HRT products.Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the real reason for the shortages was unclear.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s PM programme, she said: “We know that there are the generic phrases like ‘supply issues’ and ‘manufacturing problems’. “But because it’s commercially sensitive ... nobody will be honest with the public and the NHS. So it’s frustrating.”Stokes-Lampard encouraged women to get their repeat prescriptions for the products earlier than usual. She said that if their pharmacies were out of stock of their usual product, they should ask pharmacists about alternatives and inform their GP. For women experiencing the menopause, HRT is the most common form of treatment for symptoms including hot flushes, night sweats and vaginal dryness.Products come as tablets, skin patches, gels, vaginal creams, pessaries and rings.According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, around a million women in the UK use treatment for symptoms of the menopause."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b03bf08267b086d9187d673ef73b1fe3b457f02b/86_688_1551_930/master/1551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2b8a0e80fc6ad5da83cfb00a521e22","title":"australia jofra archer pat cummins ashes","story":"Pat Cummins believes Jimmy Anderson will be a “massive loss” for England in the second Ashes Test and says Australia are well prepared to deal with his replacement, Jofra Archer, at Lord’s.Anderson has been sidelined by a calf injury, with his return date unclear, after he managed only four overs of the opening Test at Edgbaston before Australia went on to win by 251 runs.“It’s unfortunate for them that he went down early in the first game it’s no secret that he is a massive loss,” said Cummins, who last week became the second fastest Australian to 100 Test wickets as he reached the mark in his 21st outing.“He’s been their highest wicket-taker and is arguably the best bowler in the last few Ashes series. As soon as he went down I felt like there was a real opportunity in the second innings to try and get some overs into their bowlers and bat well.

These sentences are free entertainment in their own right. “Love musicals, hate laundry?” (Add “– the Musical!” to anything you can imagine, and somebody will be putting it on in a cellar 30 minutes’ walk from wherever you currently are.) “They dress up as stereotypes of women and then wrestle.” “Comedy about your daddy issues – we’ll sort them out.” They started to sound like cryptic crossword clues to which nobody has the answer.There was much talk of an influx of comedians whose sets promised variations on the old “it’s political correctness gone mad” trope, as if their views were new, a kind of truth-telling backlash against the myth that comics are being silenced by bossy, you-can’t-say-that leftwingers. That may surprise anyone who has glanced at the internet ever. In the interests of giving it a go I went to see Titania McGrath (Pleasance Above), the brainchild of comedian and Jonathan Pie co-creator Andrew Doyle. McGrath came to Twitter fame as an account spoofing millennial activism and “wokeness”, but here she has been turned into a raving posho who hates homeless people. It got itself in a tangle, unsure, in the end, whether it was sending up wokeness or hypocrisy, and falling between both, as McGrath, played by Alice Marshall, became neither satire nor true monster. Clearly, however, she has watched a lot of Kate Tempest performances, so if slam poetry impersonations are your thing, fill your boots.I started to play standup bingo. For a full house: referring to a recent breakup, mentioning a bad review – because you can take it! – mentioning the , bringing up Brexit once without conviction but out of a sense of obligation, and apologising to the men in the audience for being mean about them. ( – the Musical!). The anti-PC comedians, who just want their views to be heard, like they are in almost every mainstream newspaper daily, didn’t seem to have much of a point. There was no atmosphere of censure or fear, and healthy provocation was alive and well everywhere.I could not remember the last time I saw standup as joyously filthy and smutty as London Hughes: To Catch a Dick (Pleasance Attic). It felt like a throwback somehow. Hughes charmed the crowd with a gutsy, gag-heavy show about, well, mostly blowjobs, but not if her grandmother asks. Across the courtyard there was Catherine Bohart: Lemon (Pleasance Above). Bohart had a deservedly breakout year with her debut in 2018, but during that run an audience member called her “disgusting” for talking about her sex life. She had talked about her girlfriend, not her sex life, so this year she has taken on the challenge with admirable gusto.Intimacy of a less primal variety was everywhere, and theatre made a desperate push for human connection. I baptised the week with 8:8 (Summerhall), a neat little wonder staged in an old women’s locker room in which people simply tell a story from their lives, playing around with what is true and half-true. If you’re going to go to an arts festival, this was as arts festival as it could get, but over 25 minutes it grew from silence into something so utterly special that I used it as my go-to recommendation whenever anyone asked what to see. The woman next to me cried, so be warned, if uncomfortable and prolonged eye contact makes you weepy.8:8 was a slick blockbuster compared to Arthur, which Daniel Bye performs in whoever has booked him’s front room. Bye deftly weaves his mini-audience through his thoughts on nature versus nurture and the shameful rise in child poverty, via gentle science detours on crayfish and Diane von Furstenberg’s cloned dogs. I jumped into a living-room booking and spent a good portion of this warm, touching exploration of trying to parent as best you can with co-star and main attraction Arthur, Bye’s six-month-old son, on my lap. He was a pro, and it was a standout debut performance.Jonny Pelham: Off Limits (Just Out of the Box) was an unforgettable hour of comedy, and not just because rainwater began to pour into the cave in which we sat (part of the substructure of Edinburgh’s 18th-century South Bridge) a short time into the performance. Pelham was explaining that he has worryingly low levels of anxiety, which at that moment came in handy. Happily, someone brought a bucket and the show could go on. The Bradford comedian takes a traumatic part of his life and miraculously and delicately turns being abused as a child – a situation that doesn’t scream out for the comedy treatment – into a vivid, honest and funny examination of how he could stand up on stage and talk about what people find so hard to hear.Hearing was a very literal problem for poor Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran (Traverse), an ambitious, sprawling show about consumption, a decaying world and technology which tore up the traditional theatre rules about turning off phones and asked the audience to turn them up instead, so they could interact with the show via their Instagram account. Sadly, the broadband got performance anxiety. When this bold, smart story worked, you could see the potential, but most of the audience were distracted by their phones’ refusal to play along in time, and the cacophony felt like having too many tabs open on your browser. It might not have been the point intended, but was a point nonetheless.For technological horrors with a more confessional flavour, Richard Gadd’s debut play Baby Reindeer (Summerhall) was a horrifying tale of being stalked by a woman he met in a bar, who pursued him both online and in person. Gadd is no stranger to reliving trauma on stage – he won best show in 2016 for Monkey See, Monkey Do, in which he talked about being sexually assaulted – but this intense and harrowing hour, physical and frightening, has no space for comedic detours. By the end, Gadd is drenched in sweat, but he leaves the audience chilled to the bone.It speaks volumes of the fringe that you can whiplash from something like Baby Reindeer to Musik (Bijou, Assembly Rooms), an unabashed wallop of giddy, brilliant camp. Pet Shop Boys and Jonathan Harvey have revived Billie Trix, narrator of their 2001 musical Closer to Heaven, for a one-woman show and cabaret. Frances Barber is a treat as the smoky rock legend, inspired by Nico and Marianne Faithfull, telling her life story with a few shakes of the tambourine and a hefty dose of slapstick.The funniest hour of the fringe, though, was Zoë Coombs Marr: Bossy Bottom (Monkey Barrel), which grabbed the audience by the scruff and woke them all up. Coombs Marr promised nothing but jokes, just gag after gag, with no clever conceits to distract from the daftness. Anyone who has seen her previous adventurous and form-bending work as her alter ego, the sexist comedian Dave, would be wise to be suspicious of that promise, but her return to performing as herself after seven years is wonderful. She pulls that abject silliness – just gag after gag, as promised – and still sneaks it all into a clever conceit that circles and spirals into mind-melting joy. I left, as a punter should, with my face aching.Bryony Kimmings: I’m a Phoenix, Bitch (Pleasance One)The word-of-mouth, you-must-see-this, beg-a-ticket show.

Other apps have similarly impressive stats: in 2018, Bumble’s global brand director revealed it had more than 26 million users and a confirmed 20,000 marriages.It’s a far cry from the considerably less optimistic response Tinder received when it launched. Many hailed it as the end of romance itself. In a now infamous Vanity Fair article, Nancy Jo Sales even went so far as to suggest it would usher in the “dating apocalypse”.However, a new study, published last month in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, was less positive, finding compulsive use made swipers feel lonelier than they did in the first place. This was particularly bad for those with low self-esteem: the less confident someone was, the more compulsive their use – and the worse they felt at the end of it.This echoes what is felt by many users. While the web-based dating sites such as Match, which apps have largely superceded, aren’t without issues, swipe-based apps have brought with them a new layer of anxiety, prompting an increasing number of users to report malaise.In fact swipe fatigue has prompted some daters to try an analogue approach. A few years ago, when Tindermania was in full swing, visiting a matchmaker would have seemed outdated at best, tragic at worst. In 2019, the industry has not only prevailed but thrived: gone is matchmaking’s fusty image, replaced with Instagram-worthy, blush-pink branding and a far more inclusive ethos.Caroline Brealey founded Mutual Attraction, a London-based matchmaking service, eight years ago since then, she says, the company has seen a dramatic increase in younger clients. People are fed up with the online experience, she believes, left jaded by what they see as its transactional nature. “One of the key differences with matchmaking is you’re working one on one,” she says. Unlike online dating, which can see you ghosted even after meeting, matchmakers give you feedback. Crucially, they only match you with others who are seriously looking for a relationship.An even younger demographic – undergraduate students – also seems to be worrying about its odds of finding love online. The Marriage Pact project, initially created at Stanford and being rolled out to other universities including Oxford, seeks to provide a “marital backup plan” for students, with couples paired off via a questionnaire and algorithm. With one participant gloomily noting on Facebook that her Marriage Pact partner hadn’t even responded to a friend request, the service may not provide a smooth path to everlasting love, either. But with nearly 5,000 students signing up in Stanford alone, it does indicate that even carefree, digital-first young people are concerned about their online prospects and want an app-free alternative.So in the face of all this gloom, what exactly is it that makes Tinder, Bumble and the rest so perpetually compelling? “Tinder doesn’t actually present anything radically new,” explains Michael Gratzke, chair of the Love Research Network, based at the University of Hull. Dating apps, Gratzke says, closely mimic the way we make snap decisions about people in real life: “When we enter a room, it takes seconds to sort who we see.”Gratzke may be right about this – after all, the discourse around Tinder’s ability to destroy the concept of love tends to be overblown. But there is one thing about it that differs from traditional love: that dangerous, delicious swipe.There’s been a lot of talk recently about the addictive nature of social media. Tech companies have built in features to help us manage our use of their products Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed a bill to limit how long users can spend online and a well publicised campaign against the addictive nature of smartphones has been launched by ex-Google product designer Tristan Harris, who has first-hand experience of how technology seeks to monopolise our lives and attention s.Tinder, Bumble and other apps with a swiping mechanism could easily fall under this purview – one of their most common critiques is that they “gamify” dating. Anecdotally, this tends to be the primary reason my friends complain about apps: the endless presentation of profiles to be judged and sorted into “yes” and “no” piles does, after a while, have the uncanny feel of a game, not a search for love.Research also bears this out, with Katy Coduto, lead author of the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships study, suggesting that limiting swipes could be one way of making the experience less addictive. In theory, Tinder already does this, giving you 100 likes per day. But you can easily get round this – Tinder Gold subscribers, who pay for extra features, get unlimited right swipes.It’s no surprise Tinder can feel addictive – the same mechanism is used in gambling, lotteries and video games. In a 2018 documentary, Tinder cofounder Jonathan Badeen admitted its algorithm had been inspired by the behavioural reinforcement psychology he’d learned about as an undergraduate. Referred to as a variable ratio reward schedule, in it participants are given a number of unpredictable responses before the one they want, in this case a match. The unexpected hit of the win reinforces the searching behaviour, which is why you keep on swiping.But none of this is to say user experience design is the only reason people aren’t finding what they’re looking for. Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, has been Match’s chief scientific adviser since 2005. The real problem, she argues, is that we simply don’t know what we’re doing. “This is new technology and nobody has ever told us how to use it.” We shouldn’t even be thinking of these tools as “dating apps”, says Fisher. “They’re not dating sites, they’re introducing sites. The only thing they can do is if you require a certain type of person, they give you that person. That’s all any app can ever do.” If someone ghosts you, lies to you or there’s simply no spark? That’s not a tech problem – it’s a human problem.Whether we’re searching for love online or off, we’re likely to stay bound by the inexplicable foibles of the human psyche. That’s not to say apps themselves have nothing to do with our dating woes – as Coduto says, something about that slot-machine satisfaction when we get a match isn’t quite as fulfilling as we’d like and the endless choice of partners soon seems less than liberating.Fisher’s solution? Log off when you’ve spoken to nine people. More than this and we’re cognitively overloaded, she argues, leading to romantic fatigue. If they don’t work out? Get offline completely, she says. Meet someone in a park or a bar, ask friends for an introduction or approach someone on the street.And if that fails, too? Well, true love could still be just a swipe away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b32f6070d580302da845c5bbaf8fe2c9097923a5/0_292_6617_3972/master/6617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef2bfddf7cc6b9e5381c579361dc9e00","title":"greek island hopping walking on amorgos cyclades greece","story":"On the third leg of his tour, our writer explores the ancient walking trails of this mysterious Cyclades island, with its monasteries, sea cliffs and deserted hill villages• Previous stops: Ikaria, Kalymnos. Next: FolegandrosI’m getting the hang of Greek ferries. Turn up at the port early, check where the boat will dock, retire to a kafeneio, then be in the right place at the appointed time. The boat will slap down its ramp, disgorge passengers, ingest the next lot, and be gone. The entire process can take minutes. In this way I hop from Kalymnos to Kos, then take the three-hour voyage to Amorgos, at the same time shifting from the Dodecanese to the Cyclades.My third stop on this island-hopping adventure is an exciting outpost to see looming up in the early-evening haze. Imposing cliffs rise from a frothy skirt of spray then soar up through stony ramparts to peaks so high they have managed to conjure clouds from an empty sky. As we sail along the north coast, a few speckles of white houses appear, closely huddled together. This is an antique land, inhabited for around 6,000 years. The faces of the hills are lined with stone-walled terraces, occasionally interrupted by the sharp white paint of a simple barrel-roofed chapel. Between each bare headland is a dark, mysterious gorge.I’m staying by Aegialis beach in the homely Pension Askas, set back from the coast in verdant gardens. My plan is to explore on day hikes and Marios, the owner, advises an early start. I set off at six, heading up the valley on a well-marked cobbled trail, one of the ancient paths that have given Amorgos a reputation for good walking. There’s no one around except a lone mule rider coming down from Langada village, a clutch of cuboid houses tightly woven together with steep alleyways, each step painted white, every window and door blue.Above the village, now on a stony trail, I spot a snake then the rare Eleonora’s falcon before arriving at Ioannis Theologus church. As well as being a sacred place, this tiny white gem is an intricate rain-catching device: each little patio draining into deep stone cisterns. No priest lives here now, only a white cat, perfectly camouflaged against the white-washed walls. There’s a key under a rock, but I can’t get it to work and have to be satisfied with a peek through the keyhole at the painted interior.A mile further and I emerge on to a vast panorama of 600 metre-tall cliffs and wild sea. The path continues, snaking across a steep scree slope and clambering around cornices. I’ve been told that in strong winds or rain, continuing can be dangerous, but it’s a mild day … until I get halfway across. Then a violent blast of wind roars in. It’s the meltemi, the unruly summer wind, roaring up the cliff. I push on and reach my goal, the tiny chapel of Stavros, once home to monks who had fled Palestine in the ninth century seeking wild isolation. They definitely got what they wanted.I retrace my steps across the cliff and then pick out another route home: the hillsides are full of beautiful ancient pathways, sometimes choked up with spiky plants, sometimes defended by spider’s webs so thick it’s like walking into a loosely strung harp, but always leading to a tumble of stones and an abandoned cottage. Inside one I turn over a timber and there’s a rusted dining fork lying there, as if the last inhabitants had jumped up midway through breakfast and rushed away forever.Eventually I find a trail that gets me back to Langada and Niko’s taverna, a collection of colourful patios under shady vines where I grab a welcome cold drink. Later I swim and explore some smaller beaches. Dinner that night at Askas is a traditional oven-baked goat stew.Next day I set out again, this time even earlier, heading up the mountainous spine of the island along a wonderful old mule trail past more deserted ruins. These houses have no windows, only a door and a fireplace, sometimes a little niche where a precious object might have sat. Inside one I find an old wooden chest, suitable for mule transport, and roof timbers as thick as your thigh, proof that this area was once thickly forested. In fact Amorgos was an important source of oak until a devastating forest fire in 1835.I pass over a col and then down through wild gardens of thyme and juniper where clouds of butterflies accompany me. It’s still early and I’ve only seen one goatherd, but when I finally reach the monastery of Panagia Chozoviotisa I’m in for a shock.This magnificent edifice, tucked neatly into the face of the tawny cliff 300 metres above the sea, is filled with tourists bussed up from the port of Katapola. I’m dusty and sweaty and the attendants take pity, ushering me into a kitchen and serving shots of psimeni raki, a spirit brewed by the three resident monks with lemon leaves, spices and sugar. It has legendary restorative powers, they assure me, although I reckon the large glasses of iced water also help.The monastery was reputedly built here after an icon of the Virgin Mary miraculously turned up in the 11th century, having travelled from Wadi Qilt near Jericho, a place I have visited and one that has a similar spectacular cliff location. From the monastery I march on with renewed vigour to nearby Chora, another wonderfully labyrinthine settlement with lots of tiny tavernas tucked into its shady alleyways.Walking in Greece in high summer may not be ideal (May or October would be better) but draconian early starts and coordination with the local buses have convinced me it’s fine. Every island of any size seems to have good services – there is actually no need to hire a car. By late afternoon I’m lounging in the sea looking forward to the home cooking of the guesthouse. I have fallen heavily for this island, and am regretting not scheduling more time here: a few extra months would have been good.• The trip was provided by On Foot Holidays a four-night break, including B\u0026ampB, route directions, maps, transfer and local telephone support costs £350pp a seven-night break to Naxos and Amorgos is £485pp (both trips exclude flights and ferries).

So what’s next for one of Britain’s best-loved footballers?Since failing to break into the first team at Tottenham as a teenager and getting loaned out to Dulwich Hamlet and IFK Hässleholm in the Swediesh third tier, Crouchy has spent two decades proving people wrong. The wrong shape to be a striker, the wrong shape to be any kind of footballer, he scored 108 Premier League goals for the seven Premier League clubs he played for, including ridiculous bicycle kicks – then he really was hanging upside down in the air – and that wonder volley against Manchester City. He scored 42 goals for Liverpool. And, after initially being booed by England supporters, he was capped 42 times for his country, scored 22 times and went to two World Cups. Recently, he has been proving himself in different ways. With his (second) autobiography, his comic tweeting and his excellent That Peter Crouch Podcast on the BBC, he has demonstrated qualities not often associated with or witnessed in his profession: insightfulness, awareness of some of the absurdities of his world, a sense of humour. Crouchy is funny. “Summer for me is about time with the family,” he Tweeted, with a picture of him feeding giraffes. An interview once asked he what he would be if he hadn’t been a footballer. “A virgin,” came the reply.Back of the Net won’t just be a trip back down Lad Way, he promises, a return to Baddiel and Skinner’s Fantasy Football League. “I think maybe that’s been done and football’s moving in a different direction,” he says, citing the rise of the women’s game. Logan will help to ensure that the programme is not just blokey banter. “It’s not just young lads who like football any more,” Crouch says. “It’s a huge range of different people – everyone, really.”Apart from Clancy, that is. She has been known to call her husband at 10 to three on a Saturday to ask what his plans are for the afternoon. He doesn’t mind that she’s not interested – in fact, it’s nice to come home and talk about other things, he says. She wasn’t interested in the Women’s World Cup either. It’s the game, not him. Did he watch it? “Yeah. It was very good the standard was good, the coverage was good, England did great. I would’ve liked to have seen them win it, obviously, but America were the best team in the tournament.”It will help more girls into football, he says, although his daughters – Sophia, 8, and Liberty, 4 – seem to have inherited their mother’s apathy towards the game. The elder takes an interest when it suits her, like when some of the boys at holiday camp asked her if her dad really was Peter Crouch. Suddenly, he says, she wanted him to come and pick her up. “And she came on the field after the last game at Burnley they enjoyed that.”Football may have broadened its appeal and become more inclusive over the course of the 23 years Crouch has played the game, but it has also seen a return to the bad old days. There are more incidents of overt racism in the stands. “Yeah, that’s something we don’t want to see or hear,” he says. And is it not extraordinary that there are still no current Premier League footballers who are gay and out? It’s like a last bastion of homophobia. “There is talk of a gay footballer coming out,” he says. “But I don’t think it would be an issue now it shouldn’t be, in this day and age.” Crouch has had abuse hurled at him from the stands, including – since starting out as a teenager – chants of “freak”. And it did get to him. “Of course, I was a bit conscious of being so skinny and tall. I’m different-looking to the average footballer. So, obviously, when I started getting those chants it was hurtful, and it pushed me to the point where I thought: ‘Do I really want to put myself through this?’ Yes, I had doubts and things like that, but I look back on it now and I’m proud of coming through that.” He’s not just different-looking. Crouch doesn’t behave like your stereotypical Premier League player, either. “I think footballers are perhaps too guarded. Maybe I’ve let people in a bit more, just being a bit more honest.”No, it’s not to do with being more middle-class, he says. (His dad worked in advertising – Crouch did work experience at his agency and loved it. He says he might have gone into something like that – as well as remaining a virgin, obviously – if he hadn’t become a footballer). “I had quite a traditional upbringing, but, you know, I grew up around football and footballers, I was the same I’ve got a lot of my mates from football.”He says the football industry and many players take themselves way too seriously. “If you’re a player at the highest level, and you get told you’re amazing, day in, day out, it may be hard to climb down from there,” he says, raising his hand from the sofa, to indicate the highest level. But Crouch wasn’t always up there (except literally). Perhaps that helped make him who is, I say. He says the loan in Sweden grounded him and made him really work for success.“Then I had to struggle at QPR I went up and down, got to the Premier League, but even at 23 I wasn’t quite ready for the Premier League. I went back down. I wasn’t Michael Owen, I didn’t burst on and score a goal for England at 18. I sometimes think the way I did it …”, he pauses, then laughs. “No, listen, I’d rather have been Michael Owen.” But imagine listening to That Michael Owen Podcast. Exactly now you’re imagining switching it off.When we meet, Crouch hasn’t officially hung up the size 12s, and he jokes about taking over from Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, or Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain. But a couple of days later he announces his retirement, on Twitter. And the love comes gushing in, practically national-treasure levels. There is nothing like quitting to silence the knockers and the doubters. He is obviously thinking a lot about it when we meet. He talks about missing the game. “Scoring a goal in front of 50,000 people, getting everyone on their feet, you can’t replicate that. How else do you get 50,000 people to stand up by something you’ve done?”It’s not easy, retiring in your 30s. He thinks there should be more help for players when they reach the end of their playing days. “You got all this money but if you don’t invest it, it finishes and you’ve got no other skills, no other qualifications in anything else. It can be hard and you can see why players get depressed, they drink, or gamble, or get orced it happens a lot. I think there needs to be some sort of care for players.” Crouch feels fortunate, in that he has options that other retiring players don’t have. He’s got his coaching badges, that’s always an option. Oh, and he’s even got the GNVQ in Leisure and Tourism he did as a teenager at Spurs (Ledley King was in the same class). “I could open a swimming pool or something, be a lifeguard.” But for now the media stuff is going well. He loves doing That Peter Crouch Podcast and people love listening to it. “I literally sit there in a pub, having a beer, chatting to a couple of lads about football. It’s like the best job ever.” And now the Amazon show is starting. Move over Gary Lineker, is that what we are saying? “Ha ha ha, no, I’m not saying that. I think you only get out what you put in and he has obviously put a hell of a lot of work into where he is. Because he’s so good at what he does, you forget how good he was as a player. If I can have half the career he has had, that would be good.”Will he be paid as much as Lineker? “No, I will not. He does very well.” Probably unsurprisingly, he won’t tell me how much he will be paid. Will he be political, as Lineker is? “No. He enjoys it. Obviously, I’ve got my opinions, but they won’t be getting shared.” Red or blue, though – talking not Liverpool football teams, but politics? “Ha, green.” Leave or remain? “Oh, no comment, I’m not getting involved in that it just angers people. I think that’s genuinely why people enjoyed the podcast, because every other podcast I looked at was a Brexit podcast. Everyone is talking about leaving and remaining – it’s like, let’s put that down for a second and have a laugh.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d94af09c0f22438fb03f8ff68d446bb75f734292/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d8b0c0adf3cc2eae8596b30c884135","title":"pacific islands forum tuvalu children welcome leaders with a climate plea","story":"Climate crisis is more than a meeting agenda item in a host country that could be left uninhabitable by rising sea levelsAs the leaders of Pacific countries step off their planes at Funafuti airport this week for the Pacific Islands Forum, they are being met by the children of Tuvalu, who sit submerged in water, in a moat built around the model of an island, singing: “Save Tuvalu, save the world.”The welcome sets the tone for a Pacific Islands Forum meeting that will not only have climate change at the top of the agenda – as it has been for many years – but is being hosted by a country that the UN says is one of the most vulnerable to rising sea levels, which could render it uninhabitable in the coming century.Apart from the important symbolism, Tuvalu’s hosting of the event presents considerable logistical challenges for the nation, as more than a dozen world leaders and an estimated 600 people will descend upon the country with a population of just 11,000.Tuvalu, which is roughly three hours north of Fiji, is also grappling with an ongoing outbreak of dengue fever, the fact it has no supply of safe fresh water, and the fact that it is designated by the UN as a least-developed country.Pacific leaders, including the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who both arrive on Wednesday, will be staying in bungalows. Other delegates and officials are being housed in grey two-storey demountable buildings along the length of the island’s airport runway, which runs almost the entire length of the island and as the largest plot of land also gets used for football games, drying clothes and for people to sleep on.The Tuvaluan prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told  Australia that hosting the conference, which officially begins on Tuesday, was an opportunity the country could not pass up.“The people of Tuvalu are very, very strong, they are very firm that they want to protect and save their island and their people and their way of life and their resources,” said Sopoaga. “So they are looking at the forum as an opportunity to showcase their resilience.”Morrison is likely to come under pressure from leaders of Pacific island nations, who have repeatedly criticised Australia for what they see as insufficient action to address the climate crisis.Sopoaga said the Australian prime minister was a welcome guest in his country and he anticipated “positive and progressive discussions”, but said he had concerns about Australia’s coalmining policy and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions and said the positive relationship could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously.“I hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,” Sopoaga said.Another key issue that may see Australia on opposing sides to its Pacific neighbours is that of human rights abuses in West Papua. A delegation from West Papua, including the Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda, was due to attend the forum as part of the Vanuatu government’s delegation, but as of Sunday afternoon the West Papuan group had not been able to arrive in Tuvalu, with both Sopoaga and Taylor saying they knew nothing about the delegation’s difficulties in reaching the country.Australia is strongly supportive of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, while the independence movement has widespread support among several key Pacific island nations – particularly Melanesian neighbours Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands.The forum may also mark a shift in the power balance of the forum. This year will be the first time a Fijian prime minister has attended the summit since the country was suspended in 2009 for refusing to call elections.Though Fiji was reinstated into the forum in 2014, its prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has never attended, saying in 2010 that he would not attend while Australia and New Zealand were part of the group because they wielded too much influence, telling the ABC: “I don’t think they should be in the forum, they’re not Pacific islanders.”Bainimarama presided over the UN’s leading climate change body in 2017, COP23, and is a high-profile global figure in the fight against global heating and will lend strength to other Pacific leaders such as Sopoaga and the Marshall Islands president, Hilda Heine, who are also key Pacific figures in this debate.China’s battle for influence in the Pacific region is also likely to emerge as a key theme during discussions. Tuvalu is one of a handful of countries in the world – several of which are located in the Pacific – that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, rather than mainland China, which is not a member of PIF but will send a delegation as a dialogue partner.The PIF secretariat will likely be looking to make sure there is not a repeat of last year’s events, when the Chinese delegation walked out of one of the talks during the PIF meeting in Nauru, which also has diplomatic relations with Taiwan.China’s presence in the region also might mean Australia finds itself with far less leverage than it once did, says the Australia-based Pacific analyst Tess Newton Cain.“This is the first time that I can remember that Australia hasn’t been able to play the money card, and say: ‘what if we took our aid money away? What if we didn’t pay for that?’” she says. “Fiji and Vanuatu would say ‘well do what you like, I’m off to Beijing next week’.”Because of Australia’s potentially reduced leverage in the region and the increasing gulf between Australia and its Pacific neighbours on climate change, the meeting is likely to throw into relief questions about the identity of the Pacific Islands Forum, the region and Australia’s place in it.“From what I can see, I don’t see that Morrison has a mandate to give Pacific leaders what they say they want,” said Newton Cain.“It wasn’t long ago that Australia was saying they wanted to be a leader in this region,” she said. “They don’t say that anymore, the question is, do they even want to be on the team, is there even a place for them on the team, not to mention the captain of the team?”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cyclist collided with car, bringing group crashing to the ground, near ShannonCommunity could be seen as \u0026lsquooppressive minority\u0026rsquo, according to QUB historianJoe McHugh pledges university registration fees will not exceed \u0026euro3,000 if FG returnedAnti-cult campaigners says organisation may have unwittingly been given a platform\u0026lsquoWe share a love of this place.

File image: Alan BetsonThe The UK’s decision to hold a referendum on Brexit with little thought to the consequences for Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations follows a pattern where British political figures have exhibited a misunderstanding of Ireland and Northern Ireland, according to a leading academic.Prof Mary Murphy, of the Department of Government and Politics at UCC, said that historically British prime ministers such as Ted Heath and Margaret Thatcher had demonstrated distorted understandings of Irish interests and motivations vis-à-vis Northern Ireland which infected the British-Irish relationship.And the Brexit referendum pointed to a repeat of that pattern as Britain, having invested heavily in Northern Ireland during the peace process, had gradually disengaged over the past 20 years as the peace process settled into its own dynamic, she said.“There was a failure to appreciate how isive and destabilising the issue would be for Northern Ireland… I pose the question: If Britain truly understood the complexities of the relationship between these two islands, I wonder if there would have been a referendum in the first place?” Speaking at the West Cork History Festival in Skibbeeen, Prof Murphy said the loss of trust between Britain and Ireland was perhaps the most troubling consequence of Brexit and both states and their peoples were the poorer as a consequence.Prof Murphy, who holds a Jean Monnet Chair in European Integration, said the future for British-Irish relations was very difficult to predict.“Once the UK departure process is complete, the relations between Ireland and Britain will require some new thinking about bilateralism as Britain assumes its place outside the EU and Ireland remains a member.“Brexit has damaged British-Irish relations and, make no mistake about it, that damage will take some considerable time to repair. It will require strong political leadership, mutual respect and a shared purpose.”Historian, Dr Ruth Dudley Edwards said she had reflected at length on the implications for Ireland before voting leave as she believed that the EU had become undemocratic and she did not like the way it treated it Greece. “I felt in the end to stay in was like being manacled to a dying person,” she said.Speaking in a panel discussion, Dr Dudley Edwards said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar must be starting to question the wisdom of insisting on the backstop as it now looked like the withdrawal agreement provision, which was designed to avoid a hard border, could lead to one under a no-deal scenario.Dr Dudley Edwards also suggested Brexit had undermined the cause of a united Ireland as it highlighted just how difficult it was to change the status quo. She pointed out that it had led Mr Varadkar to observe that it was too soon to be discussing such matters.Historian Brendan Simms, Professor of the History of International Relations in Cambridge, also posited that Brexit, far from leading to a united Ireland, might actually have the opposite effect by increasing the political distance between unionists and nationalists as positions hardened over the issue of the backstop.“I think if you have a hard Brexit, a united Ireland recedes as a possibility… the huge distrust we already have gets worse between north and south and, because after October 31st, there is prolonged confrontation between the UK and the European Union in which the Irish republic is on one side.“I would like to know what the strategy is in Dublin after October 31st when there is no deal and no backstop. As I understand it, Leo Varadkar’s policy is there will be no trade deal until there is a backstop and that will deepen the ide between north and south and the ide between the UK and EU.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3983169.1565542303!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"criticism over scientology stand at dublin comic con","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Scientology stand at Dublin Comic Con this weekend. Photograph courtesy of Mike GardeDialogue Ireland Trust An anti-cult activist has criticised the presence of the Scientology organisation at a comic convention in Dublin. The Scientology community centre in Firhouse had a stand at the Dublin Comic Con: Summer Edition in the Convention Centre Dublin over the weekend.Two volunteers from the centre handed out leaflets about a comic art competition the Scientologists are running. Young people were encouraged to enter a competition “for artists to create an Irish drug-free superhero”.The volunteers took the names of attendees visiting the stand, their ages and their email address.Dublin Comic Con, which is now in its seventh year, is hugely popular among young people in particular and attracts 20,000 visitors over two days. This year’s event included The Hulk from the 70s TV series, Lou Ferrigno, actress Cordelia Chase who played Charisma Carpenter in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Pom Klementieff from s of the Galaxy 2. Dialogue Ireland Trust director Mike Garde said the event organisers may have unwittingly given a stand to what he described as a “very dangerous organisation”. “The Scientology model is to infiltrate every single area of life,” he said. “ If you question them, they act like they don’t know what you are talking about. “The ordinary punter goes to their stand thinking it is a comic thing. They don’t actually realise they are giving their name to the Scientologists.”Though scientologists have been operating in Ireland since their founder L Ron Hubbard lived in Merrion Square for a time during the 1950s, the controversial church has bolstered its presence in Ireland since acquiring a national affairs office in Merrion Square in 2016 and an “Ideal Org” in Firhouse, southwest Dublin a year later.Scientology has been accused of operating like a cult, by separating members from their families and demanding large sums of money from its followers.Its volunteers at Dublin Comic Con distributed information packs entitled “The Truth about Drugs” from the Foundation for a Drug-Free World which is an affiliated body to the Church of Scientology.Mr Garde said Scientology often operated behind various fronts and event organisers might not be fully aware of the reality of who they really are, although the Scientology stand at Dublin Comic Con was clearly marked as such.The female volunteer at the Scientology stand handed out a press release to this reporter with a contact email and telephone number.There was no response from the Scientology community centre’s director of public affairs. Dublin Comic Con did not respond to a request for a comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3982991.1565532402!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin search we do not know how long she can survive","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNóra Quoirin’s parents, Meabh (centre-right) and Sebastien (right) on Saturday in  Malaysia. Photograph: Royal Malaysian PoliceEPAThe search for Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin is now in its eighth day and police say there are still no concrete leads about the schoolgirl’s disappearance from a holiday resort in Malaysia.Police have set up a local hotline number to try and get more information from the public.Muslims are celebrating Hari Raya Aidiladha and the Malaysian Insight reported that, at sunrise on Sunday, members of the search-and-rescue team, including the Nilai district police chief, Mohd Nor Marzukee Besar, joined about 500 local people at the Kariah Pantai Mosque in Seremban, where about 300 people had offered special prayers for Nóra on Friday.The Irish pop group Westlife and the popular Malaysian actress Fasha Sandha have made personal appeals, calling for every assistance in the search for the vulnerable teenager.The search-and-rescue teams are now scouring a narrowed-down area close to the Dusun resort from which Nóra went missing last weekend. They are rechecking places already examined. Heavy rain has made conditions particularly difficult for those searching in the rainforest.Nóra’s father, Sebastien, raised the alarm last Sunday morning when he discovered that Nóra was not in the bedroom she was sharing with her younger siblings. The family had only checked in to the resort the previous day, intending to stay for a two-week holiday.Over the past week, hundreds of people have been searching the jungle for 15-year-old Nóra, who has learning and developmental disabilities.Negeri Sembilan police chief Mohamad Mat Yusop told reporters on Saturday that police were very worried about Nóra’s welfare. “We do not know how long she can survive,” he said.Mr Mohamad on Saturday said the search area has been reduced from a 6km to 4km radius. More personnel have been drafted in, including members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police.On Sunday, he said that in the 10 years since it was established, there had never been a missing person case at the Dusun resort.Expert trackersNearly 300 people were involved in the search on Sunday. They include expert indigenous trackers from the Senoi Praaq special unit. Helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras have been deployed.To aid in the search for Nóra, a recording of her mother’s voice is being played via loudhailers. Search teams are also playing the recording on their phones as they move through the jungle.Police have confirmed that they are liaising with Interpol about Nóra’s disappearance.An Garda Síochána has deployed a Garda liaison officer to Kuala Lumpur to assist the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is providing consular assistance to the familyThe garda will liaise as required with the Malaysian police and UK and French authorities.On Saturday, Nóra’s mother Meabh thanked search-and-rescue teams for their efforts in the operation so far.Being comforted by her husband while she spoke, she said: “We want to say thank you to each and every one of you. We know you are searching night and day for Nóra.“We see you working so hard and also praying with us, being with us. We know you have given up your time, especially at a special festival time, to be with us here.

Terima kasih (thank you).”This was the first time Nóra’s mother had spoken publicly about her daughter’s disappearance. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, has been helping the Quoirins to deal with the media.Nóra’s family believes that she has been abducted. Police say the case is still officially that of a missing person, and there is no evidence of foul play, but they add that they are ruling nothing out.Police found unidentified fingerprints on a window that was open in the downstairs living room of the guest house the Quoirin family are occupying, but there has been no announcement as yet about the results of forensic examination of the prints.Nóra’s family issued a statement on Friday, going into great detail about the type of person she is.Nóra is “fun, funny, and extremely loving,” they said. “She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.”Nóra’s verbal communication is limited. She cannot make or receive phone calls independently. She can wash and dress herself, but cannot manage buttons, and struggles to wash her hair.“Nóra likes to walk with her family, but her balance is limited and she struggles with co-ordination. She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost,” her family said.Nóra was born with holoprosencephaly, a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the right and left hemispheres."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3982883.1565425195!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin s mother thanks search teams as operation enters day seven","story":"Mummy\u0027s here, love.

Terima kasih (thank you).”This is the first time Maebh has spoken publicly about her daughter’s disappearance. The Lucie Blackman Trust, which supports British nationals in crisis overseas, has been helping the family deal with the media.Nóra’s father reported her disappearance last Sunday morning when he discovered that she was missing from her room at the Dusun holiday resort, about 63 km south of Kuala Lumpur. The family checked in at the resort last Saturday morning (August 3rd).About 250 people have been scouring the jungle next to the resort. Extra personnel were drafted in on Friday.Expert indigenous trackers are involved in the search operation, ers have been scouring the river that runs through the forest, and helicopters and drones equipped with thermal imaging cameras have been deployed. Police said on Friday the search area, which is ided into six one-square-kilometre\u0026nbspzones, was being expanded.Nóra’s photograph is being handed out at roadblocks in the area.DetailOn Friday, Nóra’s family issued a statement, going into great detail about the kind of person she is.“Nóra is a very special person,” they said. “She is fun, funny, and extremely loving. With her family, she is very affectionate – family is her whole world and she loves to play games, like Cat Bingo, with us. She likes to tell us silly jokes and wear clever, colourful t-shirts. She is not like other teenagers. She is not independent and does not go anywhere alone.”The family explained that Nóra’s verbal communication is limited. The statement said: “Nóra can read like a young child, but she cannot write more than a few words. She has a good memory, but she cannot understand anything conceptual. She is unable to do maths and so things like money are impossible to manage.”Nóra’s family explained that she cannot make or receive phone calls independently, that she can wash and dress herself, but cannot manage buttons, and that she struggles to wash her hair. At school, she is learning to ride a bicycle properly.“Nóra likes to walk with her family, but her balance is limited and she struggles with co-ordination. She has been to Asia, and many European countries before, and has never wandered off or got lost,” her family said.Nóra’s relatives explained that she was born with holoprosencephaly, which, they say, means that her brain is small. Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation resulting from incomplete separation of the right and left hemispheres.“All her life she has spent a lot of time in hospital,” Nóra’s family explained in their statement. “When she was born, she needed operations to help her breathing. She has specialists that monitor her growth, her physical abilities and her strength, and especially her mental capacity.“Nóra has always needed dedicated specialist educational provision, and now attends a school for children and young people with learning and communication difficulties.”Nóra and other members of her family are bilingual and bicultural, her relatives added in their statement yesterday. “Nóra is very proud that she can speak French as well as English.”Nóra, her family says, is very sensitive. “Outside the family, Nóra is very shy and can be quite anxious. Every night, her special time is for cuddles and a night-time story with her mum. And she was extremely excited about the family holiday in Malaysia,” the family added.AssistingThe deputy police chief for Negeri Sembilan, Che Zakaria Othman, said on Friday that members of the elite 69 Commando unit of the Royal Malaysian Police, also known as VAT 69, are now assisting in the search for Nóra.Mr Che Zakaria said almost all of the original search zones had been covered and teams were now rechecking areas, including the resort buildings. They are not focused on any one particular spot, he said.Numerous media reports have said fire-and-rescue personnel, assisted by sniffer dogs, found footprints in the jungle that they thought might be Nóra’s, but Mr Che Zakaria said yesterday that no footprints had been found.Questioned about the living room window through which police think Nóra may have exited the guest house, Mr Che Zakaria said the window could be opened from outside if not locked on the inside.Police have released photographs of the living room window, on which they found unidentified fingerprints, which are being analysed.To aid in the search for Nóra, a recording of her mother Meabh’s voice is being played via loudspeakers. The voices of other relatives have also been recorded. Search teams are also playing the recording of Meabh’s voice on their mobile phones as they go through the jungle.Malaysian police have said Nóra’s disappearance is being treated as a missing person case and that there is no evidence of foul play, but have said they are ruling nothing out.

One of the most distinguished diplomats of his era, he served as joint secretary of the British-Irish Secretariat in Belfast, established after the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 led the Anglo-Irish ision in the Department of Foreign Affairs and served as Ireland’s ambassador to five different countries, including the United States.Speaking to The  in his Dublin home this week as fears grow of a no-deal Brexit, Ó hUigínn said issues Britain would take seriously in any other context “can be disregarded if it comes with an Irish label”.Mirroring the attitudes of other senior officials who dealt with British-Irish relations at key moments over the past 40 years, Ó hUigínn, now retired, views Brexit as a policy that “seems unhinged”.Officials who helped repair British-Irish relations after testing periods, such as when Margaret Thatcher’s government refused to engage with Dublin in the early 1980s following tensions over the Falklands war, and built towards great achievements such as the Anglo-Irish and the Belfast Agreements now watch on as exchanges become fraught once more.“The British do not engage very willingly with or about Ireland, ” Ó hUigínn says. “Burke said that the English have only one ambition in relation to Ireland, which is to hear no more about it. And that is still not a bad working maxim if you want to analyse British relations.“When they have to focus on it, there is another mechanism which comes into play which I would call the Irish anomaly. Something that would be taken very seriously in another context can be disregarded if it comes with an Irish label. The Border is a classic example of this.“Why didn’t the British focus on the fact that they had an extensive land border with the European Union? The answer is that it was in Ireland. It wasn’t serious.”Statement of intentAn exhibit of this, he argues, were comments made by former UK Brexit secretary David Davis just days after the initial Brexit joint report first containing the backstop, the insurance policy to avoid a hard Border, was signed in December 2017.Davis told the BBC the backstop was “much more a statement of intent than it was a legally enforceable thing”.“He gave a very broad wink to the British public,” says Ó hUigínn. “This is Irish stuff. Don’t take it too seriously. And I think there’s a kind of psychological shock among the Tories that the Europeans don’t seem to grasp this fundamental convention.”Michael Lillis, who was a diplomatic adviser to Garret Fitzgerald and was a negotiator of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, also says there have been “numerous very difficult moments” and “a lot of obdurate, of almost blind attitudes by the British”.While acknowledging the difficulties caused by Brexit, he says “it’s been much more difficult several times in the past”.“This was in the middle of the worst period of violence that we’ve had in the 30 years, mainly Provisional IRA violence of course, but also disastrous policies by the British like internment, other disasters like Bloody Sunday. And you know eventually, in both instances, we got over it.”Lillis believe Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, will lead the UK to a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, while Ó Uigínn says “they will crash out or they will leave, certainly”.“I think Boris Johnson is determined that there will be no issue between himself and Brexit as he goes toward an election,” he adds. “And that’s why he has to avoid the practical stuff which is messy and go for the Agincourt.”FundamentalPaddy Teahon, who was secretary general at the department of the taoiseach between 1993 and 2000 – working with Albert Reynolds, John Burton and Bertie Ahern – shares a similar view.“If you listen to Boris Johnson, they want out come what may. And, really, we are very much at the receiving end. So I would have thought that’s that, in the sense.”While there have been strains in the Anglo-Irish relationship in recent decades, Brexit makes the current changes more fundamental in nature, Teahon adds.“When I was involved in the peace process, Britain and Ireland were on the same side: we wanted to get peace in Northern Ireland. You were very much in the same direction. Now, we’re in almost fundamentally opposite directions. They want out of the European Union. ”He also believes that not enough attention is being paid to North-South relations, and questions what Johnson’s real attitude is to the Belfast Agreement.“He was on with this rhetoric ‘I’m 100 per cent for the Good Friday Agreement and there’ll be no hard Border on the island of Ireland’ and all the rest of it. But it’s a little bit like his ‘I want to deal with Europe’. There’s no reality to it. He doesn’t spell out.”Even though Ireland insists it will not be drawn into bilateral negotiations with the UK and will remain under the umbrella of the EU, one source with past experience of Anglo-Irish relations said engagement continues in private.“What you hear in the public space is the bit of the iceberg that’s above the water and there’s a lot more to it underneath. I can go back to the 1970s, and at the same time there was always a strong current of official and senior official and other levels of quite constructive engagement.“And that engagement over a period of 30 years did get us through some pretty rough times when pretty bad things we happening.”EngagementThis source argues that whereas engagement between British and Irish leaders at a European level in the past created space for discussions on Northern Ireland, the reverse may be true in future: that UK-Irish encounters in the North may help with how the UK interacts with the EU.On a practical level, Teahon says “there are always contacts going on, and I suspect there are contacts going on”.Ó hUigínn says Ireland, out of self-interest, will be very sensitive to British concerns.“We would be inside the European Union, they would be outside, and they will need friends in the European Union. There would be elements to build on again. I’m not saying that we would be a proxy for them within the union, but in a legitimate way setting store by the best possible relationship with the European Union.”All of those who spoke to The  believe that Ireland and the UK will have no choice but to pick up the pieces after a crash-out Brexit, if there is to be one, and reset relations.“You still have to work through it,” says Teahon. “We’re obviously going to relate to Britain possibly in a different way going forward. There’s relations with the EU which arguably will become even more important to us, but different.For Lillis there is “no other possible way forward” than for both countries to work together.“Will we have to work through a hard Brexit before we get down to serious business again. We will have to work with the British and they with us to get out of the present unfortunate situation.”InitiativeHowever, he cautions against any Irish government waiting years, until the British relationship with the EU has settled, to make a move, and says it is up to Dublin to take the initiative. “It’s always a bit more up to Dublin than to London to take initiatives to get sort of an agenda going.”One of his own ideas is a process whereby both Dublin and London could move to clarify, for both communities in Northern Ireland, the potential shape of the province in a united Ireland.In the event of unity, Lillis argues, the British government would have a responsibility to “work with the Irish government” in representing the concerns of the unionist population.“That’s a reverse of how the Anglo-Irish agreement worked in ‘85, where the Irish government in practice represented the concerns about the nationalists.”Ó hUigínn and Teahon also say the debate around unity must be managed over the next decade or so. Teahon is concerned in particular about the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit on Northern Ireland.“What doesn’t get recognised is the people who would really suffer from a no-deal Brexit is Northern Ireland. I may be too much of an optimist, my friends tell me, but I feel Ireland is very adaptable. I think we will adapt relatively quickly”.For Ó hUigínn managing unionist concerns will be the greatest challenges of Irish politics over the next decade.The tragedy of the “Black Swan event of Brexit”, he says, is that it has turned the question of Irish unity into a “game of margins”.“You have a core hereditary nationalist, a core hereditary unionist and then an in-between item, a swing factor that is very crucial.”This dynamic has scotched the “secret hope” of those who worked on the Belfast Agreement that “it would create a breathing space, a decompression chamber where people could dismantle the poisons of the past” and calmly consider what kind of future constitutional model they wanted.“And that a united Ireland if or when it comes on the agenda will do so against a background of a Northern Ireland, you know, not being a failed entity, so to speak. I think that hope is gone.”Provoking the beastIn the immediate future of Anglo-Irish relations, he says there is “nothing for it except as patiently as we can, and as constructively as we can, try not to break any relationship that we don’t have to”.“Avoid any sort of provoking the beast or tweaking the tail or anything like that. And then just wait for the exaltation to subside.“I think the great Mr Johnson – not Boris, but Samuel – said nothing odd lasts long. And what’s happening British politics now is so odd, it will not last long.“And it’s trying to be poised as best we can for what comes afterwards and I think, by instinct, both the population here and the Government would want to be as constructive as possible.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Banaras KhanAFPGetty ImagesIndian authorities reimposed some restrictions in parts of Kashmir on Sunday ahead of the Muslim festival Eid, amid fears that large gatherings could trigger renewed protests against Delhi’s withdrawal of special rights for the region.Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government locked down the Muslim-majority region last Sunday, cutting off communications, detaining more than 300 political leaders and activists, and putting a “virtual curfew” into force with numerous police and army roadblocks stopping movement by many residents.Seeking to tighten its grip on the region also claimed by neighbouring Pakistan, India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s right to frame its own laws and allowed non-residents to buy property there.On Friday, restrictions on movement in some parts of the Himalayan region’s main city of Srinagar were relaxed, with people pouring out on to the streets to stock up on provisions.But protests erupted after Friday prayers, with pro-independence youth demonstrating before being repelled by tear gas and pellets, according to police sources, witnesses and footage shown by international broadcasters.Stay indoorsOn Sunday, a police van was seen driving around one part of Srinagar announcing that restrictions had been imposed again and asking people to stay indoors.Police checkpoints were also placed on some roads leading to the old quarter of the city, a traditional hotbed of protests, and some streets in central Srinagar.Officials were debating how to handle Monday’s Eid-al-Adha festival, one of the two most important festivals of the Islamic calendar, which typically sees several thousands throng major mosques in Srinagar.Indian officials will hold a video-conference with senior police and administration officials from all 10 districts in the disputed Kashmir valley on Sunday evening to decide on restrictions, two senior state government officials told Reuters.“We will make an assessment of the situation today,” one official said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. “I do not think we will allow large gatherings.”India’s Home Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest restrictions in Kashmir.BacklashLeaders in Kashmir had warned of a backlash against the stripping of autonomy in a territory where militants have been fighting Indian rule for nearly 30 years, leading to the deaths of more than 50,000 people.Reuters reported at least 10,000 people were involved in Friday’s protest in Srinagar’s Soura area, based on an estimate provided by a police source and backed up by two eyewitnesses. Another official source on Saturday gave Reuters the same estimate.Dilbag Singh, the Jammu and Kashmir director general of police, told Reuters on Sunday that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were returning from praying at mosques on Friday when “some miscreants” started pelting stones at security officials.“It was a reaction to stone pelting by these miscreants that one or two rounds of pump action gun was fired,” Singh said, adding that four to five men suffered injuries.Authorities had detained about 300 local leaders in total and some of them had been taken out of Kashmir, he said.Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic ties with India and suspended trade in anger at Delhi’s latest move.Hitler comparisonPakistani prime minister Imran Khan on Sunday compared India’s ruling Hindu nationalist party’s policies to dictator Adolf Hitler’s “Nazi Aryan Supremacy.” He warned Modi’s actions would go beyond Kashmir and eventually target Indian Muslims and neighbouring Pakistan.“Attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch \u0026amp appease as they did Hitler at Munich?” Khan tweeted.Ram Madhav, a senior leader in India’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), hit back.“Threat to democratic world is from Pak-sponsored Jehadi terror, not from India,” Madhav tweeted.Pakistan said on Saturday that it had gained China’s support to take a motion to the United Nations Security Council condemning the Indian decision to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir.Islamabad has not received much support from other major nations, however, suggesting its odds of success at the UN were slim.Special privilegesIndia’s BJP has long campaigned for abrogating Kashmir’s special privileges in the constitution, which it sees as an appeasement to Muslims and a hindrance to its own development.The BJP and even some top opposition leaders have welcomed the decision to absorb Kashmir fully into India, and it has brought Modi support across the country.Blocked off from the world and largely unable to work or socialize, many Kashmiris were sombre ahead of Monday’s festival. Some said they would not partake in the ritual sacrificing of sheep.“What kind of Eid is this?” said one elderly man walking down a street in downtown Srinagar’s Jamia Masjid area. “We cannot reach our loves ones, we cannot visit our relatives’ homes, then what are we celebrating?” he said, declining to be named."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Industrialist blames Scottish Government for crisis at country\u0026#39s last commercial shipyardAristocrat who offered dream job on private island lied to get a British visa, husband claimsThe Arctic town at the centre of a Norway-Russia \u0026#39spy war\u0026#39Ex-headmistress of top school faces backlash for suggesting beauty furthers women\u0026#39s careersGhislaine Maxwell: The British socialite at the centre of Jeffrey Epstein sex scandalVersace apologises in China over T-shirts identifying Hong Kong and Macao as countries Comment: Am I the only one to find grotesque, dull trainers \u2028hard to love?India promises to ease Kashmir curfew as Pakistan accuses New Delhi government of \u0026#39ethnic cleansing\u0026#39Police officer injured in Birmingham attack may never return to frontline dutiesComment: Who would be best placed to lead this Government of National Surrender?Comment: We have a right to know the total cost of the state Boris Johnson\u0026#39s estranged wife reveals cervical cancer diagnosis as she urges women to have smear testsUniversal cancels release of controversial film \u0026#39The Hunt\u0026#39 amid criticism from Donald TrumpComment: Theresa May gave the EU all it could have hoped for – now it risks losing everythingComment: The War on Meat has begun, and there are many reasons to join the resistance Donald Trump fuels conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s apparent suicideLady Pamela Hicks, Prince Philip\u0026#39s cousin, leads trend for royal podcasts with tales of tours with the Queen, aristocratic affairs, and one rogue mongoose The New York restaurant that Googles its guestsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio inside fortnite world cup future fast food","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Following the new Prime Minister\u0027s visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Philip Johnston writes that a radical new plan might be required to keep the Union together.Kyle Giersdorf might not be a name many people know, but the 16-year-old gamer recently became £2.4m richer after becoming the Fortnite world champion.

They claimed the protests were small and peaceably broken up.Earlier the BBC broadcast footage apparently showing officers firing tear gas and live rounds at a crowd of 10,000 protesters after Friday prayers in the city of Srinagar.  The BBC stood by its report, while the New York Times and India Today said its journalists had corroborated the incident.   Jammu and Kashmir has been under a media, internet and phone blackout since Narendra Modi\u0027s Indian government revoked the Muslim-majority region\u0027s special constitutional status on August 5. A curfew enforced by thousands of Indian troops has made movement and reporting in the region difficult.The move has provoked outrage in Pakistan, which has fought two major wars with India over the disputed territory since independence.Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, on Sunday accused the Indian government of pursing ethnic cleansing comparable to Hitler\u0027s annexation of Czechoslovakia.Describing the move as the Hindu Supremacists version of Hitler\u0027s Lebensraum, he said it would lead to the suppression of Muslims in India \u0026amp eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan.Attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing, he tweeted. Question is: Will the world watch \u0026amp appease as they did Hitler at Munich?Dilbag Singh, the Jammu and Kashmir police chief, on Sunday said the curfew had been eased ahead of the Muslims festival of Eid ul-adha today.   “Things are absolutely normal, not a single incident has been reported from south Kashmir even,” Mr Singh told the Hindustan Times.“We are closely watching the situation,” he said.Mr Singh said there were incidents of stone throwing in downtown Srinagar on Saturday, but insisted that any report of violence in the region “is false”.The New Delhi government on Sunday said deliveries of food and supplies were active again to Kashmir, and banks and stores were being restocked ahead of Eid.Industrialist blames Scottish Government for crisis at country\u0026#39s last commercial shipyardAristocrat who offered dream job on private island lied to get a British visa, husband claimsThe Arctic town at the centre of a Norway-Russia \u0026#39spy war\u0026#39Ex-headmistress of top school faces backlash for suggesting beauty furthers women\u0026#39s careersGhislaine Maxwell: The British socialite at the centre of Jeffrey Epstein sex scandalVersace apologises in China over T-shirts identifying Hong Kong and Macao as countries Comment: Am I the only one to find grotesque, dull trainers \u2028hard to love?Police officer injured in Birmingham attack may never return to frontline dutiesComment: Who would be best placed to lead this Government of National Surrender?Comment: We have a right to know the total cost of the state Boris Johnson\u0026#39s estranged wife reveals cervical cancer diagnosis as she urges women to have smear testsUniversal cancels release of controversial film \u0026#39The Hunt\u0026#39 amid criticism from Donald TrumpComment: Theresa May gave the EU all it could have hoped for – now it risks losing everythingComment: The War on Meat has begun, and there are many reasons to join the resistance Donald Trump fuels conspiracy theories about Jeffrey Epstein\u0026#39s apparent suicideLady Pamela Hicks, Prince Philip\u0026#39s cousin, leads trend for royal podcasts with tales of tours with the Queen, aristocratic affairs, and one rogue mongoose The New York restaurant that Googles its guestsIndians mobilise for \u0026#39resettlement\u0026#39 amid warnings over Hindu nationalist occupation of KashmirWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11 august 2019","story":"Back for a third year at Lichfield cathedral, The Great Exhibition \u0027SPACE: God, the Universe and Everything\u0027 returns with a stunning light and sound spectacle inspired by the Moon landing.

But it also described the semi-autonomous territories of Hong Kong and Macao as “Hong Kong-Hong Kong and Macao-Macao.”  Both are former European colonies that were returned to China in the late 1990s.The apology came after a Chinese actress cut her ties with the company, saying the clothing was suspected of harming China\u0027s sovereignty.The studio for Yang Mi, who had been a brand ambassador for Versace, said in a post on Chinese social media site Weibo that it had sent notice to the fashion company to terminate their contract. The motherland\u0027s sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and inviolable, the studio\u0027s statement read in part.The offending T-shirt identified Beijing and Shanghai as in China but Macao and Hong Kong as separate countriesVersace said the shirts had been removed from all sales channels on July 24 and destroyed.It\u0027s our company\u0027s negligence and we express deep apology for the impact it caused, it said on Weibo. Versace reiterates that we love China and resolutely respect China\u0027s territory and sovereignty.Donatella Versace, sister of the fashion house’s late founder Gianni, issued a similar statement on her official Instagram account, apologising for any distress and insisting she had never wanted to disrespect China\u0027s National Sovereignty.Versace is not the first foreign company to face flak over how it describes Hong Kong. China has pressured international airlines and other companies to describe the city as Hong Kong, China on their websites, rather than just as Hong Kong. The latest flap comes at a sensitive time for China, as pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are motivated in large part by a desire to protect their way of life from interference by the central government in Beijing. Industrialist blames

MacLehose proved the point by showing me the best location for watching a baseball game between the Chicago Cubs and Oakland Athletic – “and it’s 8 minutes walk from here!” QED.MacLehose and Collingwood both cheerfully accept that they are privileged white guys. They went to the King’s School, Canterbury, one of the oldest in the country. In the “Young Entrepreneurs” class they made boxer shorts in their house colours and sold them for a fiver. MacLehose went on to study international business and economics at the University of Manchester while Collingwood became a choral scholar at St John’s College, Cambridge, where he studied theology and was frequently called upon to sing “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” in a counter-tenor voice. “A knowledge of medical ethics and the ability to sing Handel arias are not obvious qualifications for a business career,” says Collingwood. But the two of them remained good friends, bonded not so much by playing sports together as by watching them in pubs.\u0026nbspCollingwood did a stint as a door-to-door Sky TV salesman. “I’m only responsible for about three dishes,” he says. Meanwhile MacLehose was working in a bar in Paris during the Rugby World Cup. “The place was rammed for every game and I had to stand on the bar singing the Marseillaise,” he recalls. “It was the best spot to view the game from.” This, in 2007, may have been the “light-bulb moment”.The two co-founders argue that nearly all contemporary online businesses started out as a list on Craigslist. “MatchPint is like an in-depth version of Most Popular Sports Bars,” says MacLehose. They describe their business as like organising a party, which needs a lot of hard work to get it right. It was a slog at the beginning. Collingwood says, “It was like Uber, but with only one car.” They started out knocking on the doors of pubs in London, asking if they were interested in being on their app. People weren’t queueing up to invest and they worked out of a flat in London. They still remember their first pub to sign up with affection: The Bowler in Clerkenwell, in September 2011.MatchPint provides information to fans, but it also offers a platform to pubs to make their lives easier. The Albion, a Young’s pub on New Bridge Street near Blackfriars\u0026nbspin London, was another of the pubs they recruited in the first week. The landlord was Canadian and they were showing a lot of Canadian ice hockey. But how many people knew that? “They were also big on rugby and football,” says MacLehose. “But organising it all and marketing it was laborious and a huge drain on their time. We said, if we could provide you with a platform that enables you to do in five minutes what you’re spending hours on, would you be interested?”Pubs also pay between £10,000 and £40,000 per annum for the rights to show live sports. They are eager to get a return on the investment.“The reason we remain passionate about this business is simple,” says MacLehose. “You can take anyone who isn’t even a fan and put them in a pub and get them watching the final over of the Cricket World Cup and it’s impossible for them not to be caught up in the euphoria.” Sport, he argues, is unscripted theatre. “Come on, even Shakespeare couldn’t have scripted Zinedine Zidane headbutting Materazzi in the World Cup final.”A View from the Top with Kodak vice president Danielle AtkinsA View from the Top with Dragons\u0027 Den star Tej LalvaniMatchPint is an online business but offering an offline experience. “We don’t want people glued to their phones all the time,” says Collingwood. “It’s too passive.” He asks me to name my high-point sports memories. I hark back to being at the 1998 World Cup in France, seeing Beckham sent off against Argentina or France beat Brazil in the final. “You see,” says Collingwood, “no one remembers the time they watched a game on their own, sitting on the sofa. You need to be surrounded by friends and other people.”It may not always be possible to get to the match itself. If you want to watch the Chicago Cubs it’s a hell of a commute. And getting in to watch West Ham (my team) is not cheap either. “The pub is the perfect hybrid experience,” says MacLehose. “You have the stadium atmosphere without the expense.” He also reckons it’s a great leveller. “You can walk into a pub in Sheffield and it doesn’t matter if you’re a big shot company executive or the school cleaner, you all want England to beat Germany.”As its name suggests, MatchPint has\u0026nbsplinked up with big brands like Heineken, Guinness, and Budweiser. And it is now expanding around the world. It\u0026nbsprecently bought its\u0026nbspFrench counterpart, Allomatch, it launched in Ireland earlier this year, and in December it is kicking off in Australia.\u0026nbspMy attention was particularly attracted by the “Premier Predictor” on the app. Rather than betting, this enables you to engage with other fans by predicting the outcome of games. On the phone, West Ham were expected to draw 2-2 with Manchester City in their big season opener. It’s a shame they didn’t quite manage to pull it off on the day.\u0026nbspWith the game having been sold out, I’m sure that many were following the match in a pub somewhere in London and having a drink to drown their sorrows.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words.

It was how they were produced and how people used them when they got to the UK that matters. So that was a real eye-opener.”Most of this comes from\u0026nbspfertilisers,\u0026nbsppesticides and the fuel used by machinery during harvesting.They are then processed and sorted. If the orange is used to make juice, 22 per cent of the total footprint is down to transport and distribution.Professor Reay said: “If you just assume everything closer to you is better, so if you’re thinking these blueberries or cucumber from Holland in January will be low carbon, they\u0026nbspwon’t be. It’s going to be intensive production with a high carbon footprint.“This will massively outweigh the food miles of bringing them\u0026nbspfrom a country where the climate is right at that time of year.”Created with Sketch.Teenage climate change protesters threatened with arrest at Heathrow  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Four teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersFour teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersAccording to government data, buying a tomato grown in the UK has three times the footprint of a banana grown in Spain.Lettuces grown in the UK during winter are cultivated in poly tunnels which require\u0026nbsplots of energy to keep them warm. In terms of carbon emissions, it is more environmentally friendly to buy them from Spain during the winter and in the UK during the summer.But food miles do matter if the product has been transported by air. For this reason, Professor Reay says consumers should avoid eating out-of-season soft fruit such as raspberries and blueberries.A 100g box of blueberries\u0026nbspgrown locally or imported via ship will produce around 100g of carbon dioxide. If it’s flown in, that increases by ten times, pushing its carbon footprint up to more like 1kg.Destruction of land must stop to tackle climate change, says reportClimate change could cause toxic mercury to accumulate in seafood“If you want to go into the high carbon footprint foods then once it’s been air freighted you’re in real trouble. That’s when the food miles absolutely soar in terms of emissions. We should have a blanket ban on air freight,” said Professor\u0026nbspReay.Despite the fiendishly difficult business of counting carbon he says the message “buy local” needs to go with “in season”. \u0026nbsp“The food mile message is a little more nuanced than it’s sometimes presented,” he added.Reducing waste would also make a significant difference to the carbon footprint.According to 2017 research food waste accounts for 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country it would come behind China and the US as the largest emitters on the planet.Professor Derek Stewart, an agri-food sector expert from the James Hutton Institute, said the book was interesting but some of the data could be challenged, notably on the grounds that it only looked at carbon dioxide emissions.Ships use dirty fuels that emit nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon dioxide which has a significantly larger greenhouse gas impact than carbon dioxide alone, he said.PMQsProfessor Stewart added: “The carbon footprint is too nebulous for most people and in fact forms only part of a food supply chain.”Dr Eugene Mohareb, a lecturer in sustainable urban systems at the University of Reading commended the overall analysis of food miles and the impacts of production.“In an ideal world, embodied carbon from production and transport would be communicated to the consumer on food products so that they could make informed decisions. But in the absence of that, eating produce in season can be a good guide,” he said.Food systems contribute to between 20 and 30 per cent of emissions globally and Dr Mohareb says the UK is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 unless these emissions are reduced.“There are many things that we as consumers can do to reduce this impact.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.He reports that the undated films announced at Comic-Con will be\u0026nbspBlack Panther 2\u0026nbsp(18 February, 2022) with James Gunn’s s of the Galaxy Vol 3 arriving on 6 May, 2022.We know one more film will be released\u0026nbspJuly 2022, but he doesn’t claim to know what it will be (fans are theorising it will be Captain Marvel 2, which Feige confirmed was in development at Comic-Con).That’s where things get really interesting.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film.

Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders.\u0026nbspReally, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey with Iron Man and moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes setting up the next movie, plus this\u0026nbspgives the series the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the movies in chronological order. This might be a little\u0026nbspconvoluted, but that should\u0026nbspnot put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out in\u0026nbspchronological order, including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows.

The rest plays mainly out\u0026nbspin release order, minus Brie Larson’s\u0026nbspCaptain Marvel.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Also, the first\u0026nbspSpider-Man\u0026nbspfilm\u0026nbsptakes place directly after\u0026nbspCivil War, while\u0026nbspRagnarok,\u0026nbspBlack Panther\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAnt-Man and The Wasp\u0026nbsplead directly into\u0026nbspAvengers: Infinity War\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame.\u0026nbspThere’s also the latter part of\u0026nbspShield\u0026nbspthat takes place concurrently with\u0026nbspInfinity War.\u0026nbspAbove is\u0026nbspjust a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Congratulations.

But the fundamentals of the British economy are strong â wages are growing, employment is at a record high and we are forecast to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan this year,” Javid said in a statement.“The government is determined to provide certainty to people and businesses on Brexit \u0026nbspthat\u0027s why we are clear that the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October.”Here\u0027s the full story on the UK\u0027s unexpectedly poor economic performance from The Independent\u0027s business and economics editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspUK economy shrinks for first time since 2012 as fears of no-deal Brexit chaos mountThe pound is hovering perilously close to the 31-month low against the dollar of $1.208\u0026nbspit reached earlier this month.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s now at $1.2083...One bright spot in today\u0027s economic numbers was the continued resilience of British consumers.\u0026nbspSpending rose 0.5 per cent in the second quarter, although this was down slightly from 0.6 per cent in the previous three months.\u0026nbspConsumers have seen wages begin to rise above inflation in recent months.A British-West African industrial consortium has submitted a last-minute rescue offer to snap up the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, the Press Association reports.\u0026nbspPA understands the unnamed industrial group has submitted a late bid to the government in an effort re-establish the international trade credentials of the site.\u0026nbspThe consortium, which involves a leading UK civil engineering company operating in West Africa, is the latest to enter the fray to take control of the steel supplier after it collapsed into liquidation 11 weeks ago.\u0026nbspMore on the potential impact of closure on Sconthorpe, here:\u0026nbspBritish Steel: Closure would ruin a historic industrial town and allow Britain to be ‘held to ransom’Package holiday firm On the Beach has blamed the plummeting pound foe a profit warning\u0026nbspissued today.\u0026nbspIt says\u0026nbspsterling\u0027s tumble\u0026nbspagainst the euro has forced it push up its holiday prices compared to competitors.\u0026nbspUnlike many of its rivals, On the Beach it does not hedge its exposure to currency changes.John McDonnell has seized on the latest GDP figures, which he says are a\u0026nbspdirect result of Tory incompetence.\u0026nbspThe Tories\u0027 Brexit bungling, including Boris Johnson now taking us towards no-deal, is breaking the economy.\u0026nbspMore on the reaction to today\u0027s numbers from political correspondent Ashley Cowburn:\u0026nbspBoris Johnson accused of \u0027breaking economy\u0027 over no-deal Brexit threats as recession fears mount\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAdvertising firm WPP led Friday\u0027s FTSE 100 firms as its shares jumped after it performed ahead of analyst predictions.\u0026nbspInvestors cheered the beleaguered firm\u0027s revenue performance as its major turnaround programme gathered pace in the second quarter. The company, which was left struggling after a string of client losses following Sir Martin Sorrell\u0027s exit last year, limited its revenue decline to 1.4 per cent\u0026nbspfor period.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPress AssociationThe pound is back to its lowest in more than two-and-a-half years against the dollar.\u0026nbspIt has fallen 0.5 per cent to $1.2067, a level last visited in January 2017.\u0026nbspAgainst the euro the pound has fallen\u0026nbspto a new two-year low of €1.078, down 0.7 per cent today.The FTSE 100 closed down 0.6 per cent to 7,242.79.\u0026nbspThe FTSE 250 index of mid-sized firms was down 0.3 per cent to 19,085.12.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTaken by itself, a 0.2 per cent contraction of UK GDP between April and June would not be a major concern, says Michael Kitson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspan economics lecturer at Cambridge University.\u0026nbspBut the alarm bells should be ringing with the Office of National Statistics (ONS) alerting about a “slowing in the underlying figures” combined with concerns about the government’s economic policy.\u0026nbspEconomists are united by one thing in the wake of the troubling GDP figures: Brexit will make them worseOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He aims to sell himself as an effective leader who is open to compromise and evidences this with his experience as governorOhio representative Tim Ryan will be running a campaign that hinges on his working class rootsMr Sanders’\u0026nbspspeech came just a day before he was set to take part in that fair’s annual “Political Soapbox”, where candidates seeking the support of Iowa flock to make their cases from a slightly raised stage, surrounded by hay.And\u0026nbspMr Sanders took to\u0026nbspthe stage after most of the other\u0026nbspcandidates\u0026nbspseeking the Democratic nomination, who\u0026nbspnumber almost two dozen.Earlier on Saturday, for instance, Elizabeth Warren delighted fairgoers with her calls for “big systemic change” to the American political system, drawing what to that point had been the largest showing of the whole affair — much larger than the turnout for Joe Biden on Thursday, and noticeably bigger than the crowd Kamala Harris had attracted earlier in the day.In the Hilton ballroom in downtown Des Moines, supporters who listened to Mr Sanders promise to codify Roe, and to repeal the Hyde Amendment, said its his consistency that stands out to them — and why they could consider supporting him against those other candidates.To prove the point, one speaker who held the mic before Mr Sanders\u0026nbspeven recited a 1993 quote of his, arguing for women’s rights.Pierse Coen, 19, a college student from Nebraska, said Mr Sanders calling out Republicans on such an important issue is necessary, given the stakes.“I think it’s important that he calls Republicans out for their hypocrisy,” she said, noting she would expect a similar sort of a check on Democrats.And, she said his experience speaks for itself: “I like his consistency. He doesn’t waver. He just stays strong.”Makayla Meyer, 15, a Des Moines high school student, said she is attracted to Mr Sanders’ unapologetic push for his values.“There’s a lot of people who say America can’t be a socialist government, but Bernie stands by who he is,” she said.Jake Atkinson, 23, a recent university graduate\u0026nbspwho was visiting from London, said that the anger he sees in Mr Sanders can speak to people on a broad range\u0026nbspof issues, helping people\u0026nbspconnect them and understand the bigger picture\u0026nbsp— and thinks that’s how the Democrats can win the next presidential election.“He really nails the intersectionality of all the issues, and how they’re all related,” Mr Atkinson said. “I think that’s how we beat Republicans in 2020.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

poor.\u0026nbspAt a time when European countries are enduring some of the highest temperatures ever recorded, and as extreme weather becomes more common, Baghdad offers a troubling glimpse into a

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Second, he’s shaking up the civil service a bit.  It was civil servants who did most of the negotiating — and they are all wildly pro Remain.But with Boris’s adviser Dominic Cummings wielding the stick they might just be a little more amenable than before.Third — he’s realised that the bloody Northern Ireland backstop was never anywhere near so serious an impediment as the Remainersclaimed.And fourth, and maybe most importantly, he’s leading the country with a sense of optimism and chutzpah.Of course it’s Boris, so he may well do something totally bonkers and wreck the process. But so far he’s got everything right.He hasn’t got long to sort out a deal, the days are counting down.

That’s not his fault — blame Theresa May for calling an election two years ago.It looks to me thatMagic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn calls a vote of no confidence, he will probably win.Labour is already cosying up to the Scottish Nationalists and saying they wouldn’t mind a second referendum on independence.There is now nothing Labour wouldn’t do to gain power. Destroy the union and scupper Brexit — Magic Grandpa doesn’t care.Butthis whole thing ends with Labour des- troying Brexit, the party will never be trusted again.Oh sure, it will still get the votes from the metropolitan, middle-class lefties. But its working-class base will desert it, for good.So the message for Magic Grandpa is very clear. Win your vote of confidence, lose your voters. He’s not the brightest of men, but I do hope he grasps this.And Boris  Keep straight ahead. Play as hardball as possible with Brussels, knowing they want a deal. Strike as many deals with the likes of the USA and Canada as possible.And remind Brussels thatwe walk away without a deal, they don’t get a single penny from us. That should help to concentrate their minds for a while.This has been revealed in a new report by researchers with too much time on their hands. What these men want, I think, is the best of both worlds.I used to have a girlfriend who spent all day long sitting on the roof of the shed. Then she’d dart out into the road after a thrush. She was great.Had a little bell around her neck. And did her business in a small tray by the back door.A WOMAN in East London said nasty things to someone taking part in a gay Pride march. She was wearing a niqab, so the lefties didn’t get too cross.Still, it is at last beginning to dawn on the woke liberals that the more fervently Muslim a person may be, the less likely it is that he or she will take kindly to people who have a knack for interior design and enjoy watching Mamma Mia!.This has put them in a bit of a quandary. Much as have those largely Muslim protests outside schools in the Midlands which insist on teaching kids how wonderful gay relationships might be.The same sort of quandary that affects feminists, who are not entirely convinced that a ft chap with a todger and a beard who wishes to be called “Loretta” in the name of gender freedom actually is a woman.This is the thing with identity politics, protected characteristics and so on. Tug gently on one of its threads and the whole thing begins to unravel like a pink mohair jumper knitted by an imbecile. HERE’S some consol­ation for you cricket fans, in despair at our Ashes defeat. Steve Smith, the man who did most of the damage, is at least HALF English.He’s got an English mum and has dual nationality.He used to play cricket for a team in Sevenoaks, in Kent.So what we should do is ide his run total down the middle – we get half, the Aussies get half.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

a conduit for much of the worlds crude oil.On July , the Guards said they had detained the Panama-flagged for MT Riah for alleged fuel smuggling.And a day later, they announced they had impounded the British-flagged Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for breaking international maritime rules.The seizure of the Stena Impero came two weeks after Royal Marines seized a supertanker believed to be carrying Iranian crude oil to Syria on July .The oil tanker Grace  was detained on suspicion it was breaking European sanctions by taking oil to Syria.Three Iranian boats also tried to seize a BP oil tanker as it passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Wednesday July .Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose - which was escorting the tanker through the flashpoint region - was forced to sail in front of the boats.After quickly training its mm deck guns on the enemy boats, deploying its Wildcat helicopter and issuing a radio warning, the Iranian boats scarpered. HMS Duncan was then deployed to patrol the busy shipping lane as all UK flagged vessels were put on the highest security alert level.But an Iranian bomb boat was found in its path, meaning the HMS Duncan could have been destroyed by the unmanned attack ship packed with explosives, the Mirror reports.Iran had earlier been blamed for a series of devastating sea mine attacks on US-linked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz.The Iranian republic has been squaring up to the West as it reels over the scrapping of the so-called nuclear deal by the US.Iran today unveiled its latest upgraded missile defence system which it brags can detect enemy missiles and drones from more than  miles away.The mobile Falaq radar installation is said to be an upgraded version of the current Gamma system, which military experts said was of Russian origin.The announcement comes at a time of rising tension between the Islamic republic and the United States."},{"url":null,"title":"raf airmen beards for first time","story":"A change to the “facial hair policy” will take effect from September .But the fuzz must be “trimmed and neat”, cover the whole jawline and be no longer than ten inches.

Helen teamed up with Blue Cross Felixstowe and HMP Hollesley Bay in Suffolk for a one-year pilot in  and the concept has gone from strength to strength, receiving a £, grant from the National Lottery last year to expand. Brainy Dogs Coordinator Sophie Wellum-Mayes says training is inidual to each dog and client, taking around eight weeks.  Volunteer trainers gain work experience, le skills and improved confidence, along with improving the futures of the dogs and their new owners. She says: “The dogs calm clients in a way humans cannot. They do not judge and for many people, this is a rare feeling. “We have been told that the dogs are a leline, they have stopped a couple of clients from ending their lives. “They get people out into social networks, give them a sense of normality and something in common with others. There are similar emotional and confidence benefits for the trainers too.” The National Lottery Awards are an annual celebration of the UK’s best National Lottery-funded projects, with this year marking  years since the first draw.

Sophie Carly Hope Smitherman was born at .pm on December , . Her parents Lyndsey and Sam Smitherman heard her cry twice before she was rushed out of the room and taken to intensive care where she lived for less than  hours. The first time Lyndsey was able to hold her little girl was after she had died. She said it felt like apossomeone had torn her heart in halfapos. Sophieaposs mum and dad had just watched doctors desperately perform CPR on their tiny daughter but eventually there was nothing more that could be done. She had struggled to breathe immediately after birth and her platelets had not formed properly meaning she had been bleeding. She had a total of  blood transfusions in the  hours she was alive, her mum said. Her siblings Jack-James, six, Annabelle-Violet, five, and Meadow, four, tragically never got to meet their baby sister.    Lyndsey turned  on Motheraposs Day this year, but she said it killed me inside. The mum-of-four told how results from an autopsy two months after Sophieaposs death on .pm on the December , , revealed she had died of Parvovirus B. Parvovirus B is a virus that commonly infects children and is not routinely tested for during pregnancy. Lyndsey claims she was told by doctors thatshe had been tested for it during pregnancy, her baby could have been saved with a blood transfusion while still in the womb. The mum is now bravely sharing her story to raise awareness of the virus, in the hope that other pregnant women will become aware of it and consider requesting a test. Lyndsey says she does not want anyone  to suffer like they have had to.    Speaking to Mirror, Lyndsey, from Kent, described the heartbreaking moment her baby girl passed away as doctors performed CPR. She said: We kept on saying aposyou can make it, you can do it Sophie.apos I sort of zoned out and felt like it was not me in the room. They said aposwe are doing everything we can for herapos and carried on for a while longer. But then they came over and said aposwe have got to stopapos. It was like someone tore my heart in half and I wanted to collapse to the floor because I was in so much pain.  But I couldnapost collapse to the floor because no one would have been able to pick me up because of the pain. As soon as she passed away they said we could hold her. Within seconds I had her in my arms and it was the first time I held her. It was amazing to be able to feel her but hard knowing that she was not actually there.    The school supervisor added: The Parvovirus B had got to her so much it was shutting everything down. The virus was in her heart, so the whole body went into shut down. I wish I had been tested for it because then I would still have her here. Lyndsey and husband Sam, , found out in May last year they were expecting another baby. The mum said it was just like any of her other pregnancies, she was sailing through it, going to her scans, and everything seemed fine. But on Sunday December  when Lyndsey went to bed things werenapost quite right. There was not a lot of movement, she described. All my girls, when Iaposve been pregnant, have kicked me to pieces. Sophie would come up between me and Sam when he used to lie on my belly, but that evening she didnapost do it.  When Lyndsey woke up the following morning she said things had not got any better as she tried to get her moving. She phoned the hospital and explained how she felt reduced movement and was advised to go in to be checked out and monitored. At that point she was nearing the  week mark. When she went into hospital for tests, Lyndsey said medics told her aposwe need to get her out as soon asapos. Theyaposd picked up her heart rate was not great and it was like she was sleepy inside, Lyndsey said. They broke my waters to try and get everything started and my contractions began pretty quickly. But doctors could see she was not getting her breath back quickly enough so they suggested an emergency c-section. We wanted to be safe so we went for it. Lyndsey said doctors were reassuring about the cesarean and she and Sam felt quite relaxed as the procedure for Jack-Jamesapos birth had been OK. Sophie was born at .pm on December , , but she was immediately whisked away by medical staff. As soon as she was born, we heard her cry twice and then she was taken away from us to help her to breathe, Lyndsey told. Just as they said to Sam aposdo you want to come over and see her,apos they rushed her out of the room and said she needed to get a bit of help. We didnapost get told anything until we went into the recovery room.  Lyndsey said as it approached midnight a doctor came to show them a picture of their daughter and explained she was in intensive care having trouble with her lungs and was jaundiced. Other people were coming in the room with their babies, but I didnapost have my baby Lyndsey said, explaining she and Sam still hadnapost met their precious daughter properly in person. In the picture she had looked perfect, she was still our daughter. But it was heartbreaking not being able to see her. It was about .am on December  by the time they were allowed to see her. Before they took her, they brought her to us but it was only for five minutes, then they rushed her out, Lyndsey said. I wanted it to last longer, she said, but her baby needed a blood transfusion. We didnapost even get to touch her as she was in an incubator. The parents were warned Sophie was not forming her platelets which was causing her to bleed. We were told sheaposd need to be transferred to another hospital but I couldnapost go with her and had to wait until .am until the ambulance took me, Lyndsey said. Sam had to drive as they wouldnapost let him in the ambulance. When they got to the second hospital, little Sophie was having further scans. It was .am when they got to see her again. She was in her little incubator and had wires coming out everywhere, Lyndsey said. She had lots of dferent machines around her and a blue light on her for jaundice. Her skin was really shiny and she was very bloated because she was being pumped with dferent things. She couldnapost breath, she was having blood transfusions every hour. I loved the fact I was able to be there with her, but at the same time I was thinking aposshe has so much going onapos.  Lyndsey still tried so stay positive, and believed her daughter would be fine and that she was in the best place. I just wanted to spend all the time with her, she told. They allowed us to sit there and touch her. We were able to stick our hand through the holeand touch her hand. But after a little while of holding her, her stats dropped and we had to move. We werenapost allowed to touch our own daughter. Doctors were constantly at her side. At around .pm, Sophie had a terrying setback as she suffered a cardiac arrest. The parents were not present at the time and were told by doctors what had happened after they had aposbrought her backapos. They warned that aposthings werenapost brilliantapos. I was shocked and thought aposwhatanything had happened to her,apos Lyndsey told. But after they said they brought her back I felt positive she would be OK and she would pull through. I thoughtsheaposd got through that, she will get through this, little fighter.  Lyndseyaposs parents had brought the other kids to the hospital after school, but they were not allowed to see their new sister as she was too ill. Late that night, Lyndsey and Sam were askedthey had thought about christening their daughter. Sam asked, aposdoes that mean she is not going to pull through,apos but they wouldnapost answer that question, Lyndsey said. I kept thinking aposshe is my little girl, she will make it throughapos. Sophie was christened at am on December  with a priest coming into the hospital for the ceremony. By .am they were taken aside by a doctor who explained aposthings werenapost looking greatapos. He said only half of her heart was doing the work, Lyndsey said. He said aposshe may not make itapos andshe did things wouldnapost be brilliant for her. That made us feel really sick. We asked my parents to get the kids out of school early so they could come and see her before anything happened. The kids didnapost get to meet her at all. At . Lyndsey and Sam were back in ICU with their daughter but had to witness doctors performing CPR on her, at barely two days old. It was hard, very hard, it made me feel really, really low, Lyndsey said. She added: My parents had just arrived with the other kids, they were waiting outside the door when she passed away. Sam was there with me the whole time, he never left my side. All we left the hospital with was a memory box with a few things of hers - her little hat that held the tubes in place, little sunglasses to cover her eyes from the blue light. Lyndsey said two months later, following an autopsy, they found out their daughter had died of Parvovirus B, also known as aposslapped cheekapos. The NHS says:Parvovirus B is a virus that commonly infects children. It is usually transmitted by coughing and sneezing and hand washing is important in helping to prevent spread. For most healthy people, Parvovirus B causes a mild, self-limiting illness which is followed by le-long immunity. Pregnant women are not routinely screened for past Parvovirus B infection as there is no vaccine or preventative treatment available. The exact number of Parvovirus B infections in the UK is not known as the virus does not always show symptoms, and the diagnosis can only be confirmed by blood test. In women who are not immune, infection in the first  weeks of pregnancy can lead to serious problems for your baby before it is born.This would usually happen three to five weeks after the onset of maternal infection, but can be later. The greatest period of risk to the baby is between four to  weeks. Infection during this time can sometimes lead to serious complications such as fetal anaemia and sometimes fetal loss .There is a five – ten per cent risk of fetal losswomen develop this infection in the second trimester. Infection in the first month of pregnancy is not thought to carry any risk. Most babies will not be infected or affected by the virus. For more information, click here.

Sophie Sutton, , was admitted to University Hospital Aintree in Liverpool on May  last year after taking an overdose, but says she was told to go home by medics despite her warnings that she wanted to jump.The former Liverpool John Moores University Student was left in agonising pain and needing surgery after shattering both her legs in the leap from the top of the multi-storey car park.She has been diagnosed with Emotional Unstable Personality Disorder and depression.    Sophie, from West Derby, told the Liverpool Echo that she had been struggling with low-mood, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. She said the jump was a genuine attempt to end her le but she did not feel that the mental health team took her seriously, despite a previous attempt to jump from the same car park.

She was also taken to Aintree on that occasion and managed to make her way to the top floor of the car park building, but was stopped from jumping by police officers.Despite the warning signs, Sophie said she felt as though the crisis team did not take her intentions seriously, which only strengthened her intention to jump.She said: It was adrenaline at first but then I just got this huge, horrible pain in both legs, and I couldnapost feel my feet. I went back to Aintree in an ambulance and they gave me gas and air and ketamine.

The -year-old reportedly hanged himself this morning at politan Correctional Center in Manhattan, where he was being held on sex trafficking charges. His apparent suicide came hours after hundreds of pages of court documents were unsealed alleging new details of sexual abuse claims against him. Epstein, who was arrested on July , had pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as , from at least  to . He previously admitted prostituting minors in  and spent  months in prison after agreeing a plea bargain.    In legal documents, released on Friday, he is said to have had scores of schoolgirls come to his mansion and give him aposmassagesapos which turned sexual. The disgraced multimillionaire, who never married or had children, is claimed to have needed aposthree orgasms a dayapos and when one woman didnapost make him orgasm she would allegedly be punished. He also reportedly had a penchant for aposthreesomes with underage girls,apos it is claimed, and hired people to recruit high school-aged girls for him.

She would approach the girls while they were at college, it is claimed. Maxwell has repeatedly denied the allegations against her and has not been arrested. Euan Rellie, an investment banker who knew the couple, said Maxwell was the “charming, likeable front person”. He added: “A big part of the reason people talked to him [Epstein] was because of Ghislaine.” While author Christopher Mason described Maxwell as “saucy”, “fantastically entertaining” and someone who happily spoke about sex. aposSex slaveapos - Virginia Giuffre    Now  and a mother of three, Virginia Giuffre claims the financier began abusing her when she was  or . She was allegedly recruited from her job at Mar-a-Lago for sex with Epstein. She claims she was taken all over the world on his private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express.” It is as a result of her legal action against Maxwell that the court documents have been released. aposMasseuseapos Johanna Sjoberg    Johanna Sjoberg testied that Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her under the guise of a legitimate assistant position, but asked her to perform sexual massages for Epstein. She claimed she was punished when she didn’t cause Epstein to orgasm. She alleged on the second time she went to the house she was taken to Epsteinaposs bathroom where she and another woman massaged him. She told officials: She was showing me how to massage. And then she -- he took -- he got off the table, she got on the table. She took off her clothes, got on the table, and then he was showing me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes off. They asked me to get on the table so I could feel it. Then they both massaged me. Maxwell allegedly referred to the other woman as her aposslaveapos. When Ms Sjoberg asked why Epstein received so many massages, she said: He explained to me that, in his opinion, he needed to have three orgasms a day. It was biological, like eating. aposSeedyapos bedroom One young girl who claimed to have visited Epsteinaposs house alleged she climbed a narrow, winding staircase, past walls covered with photographs of naked girls.She told the Miami Herald at the top of the stairwell was a vast master bed and bath, with cream-colored shag carpeting and a hot pink and mint green sofa. The room was dimly lit and very cold. There was also a vanity, a massage table and a timer, she said. Coded messages Hundreds of coded messages were found by police in rubbish bins and at Epsteinaposs Palm Beach residence in . Some were from underage girls who were calling to schedule a time to come over to see Epstein. One message which allegedly reflected that a friend of Epstein is sending him a sixteen year old Russian girl for purposes of sex said: “He has a teacher for you to teach you how to speak Russian. She is X years old not blonde. Lessons are free and you can have your st todayyou call.” Another said: “She is wondering: is o.k. She needs to stay in school.” Other messages from unknown callers include communications such as, “I have female for him” and “want to knowshe should bring her friend with tonight,” according to the documents. Nude photos    After Epsteinaposs arrest, prosecutors said a search of his townhouse, conducted under a warrant, uncovered evidence of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of nude photographs of what appeared to be underage girls,aposapos including some photos cataloged on compact discs and kept in a locked safe. In a court filing on July , the government said it was pursuing an ongoing investigation of uncharged iniduals in connection with the case against Epstein. Sex slave books Police found a receipt from Amazon in his rubbish bin for books on the subject of aposerotic slavesapos and how to use sex slaves, according to the court documents. The books ordered in his name, included SM : A Realistic Introduction, SlaveCraft: Roadmaps for Erotic Servitude and Training with Miss Abernathy: A Workbook for Erotic Slaves and their Owners. Sex toys Tony Figueroa testied that he was told by Ms Giuffre about threesomes she had with Maxwell and Epstein, which included the use of strap-ons. He also claimed Maxwell called him a number of times askinghe had found any other girls just to bring to Jeffrey. aposShaking Swedish girlapos Rinaldo Rizzo, a house manager for one of Maxwell’s close friends - Eva Dublin - testied through tears how, while working at Dubin’s house, he observed Maxwell bring a -year-old Swedish girl there. In distress, the teen girl allegedly tearfully explained to him that Maxwell tried to force her to have sex with Epstein through threats and stealing her passport. He testied: [She was] very attractive, beautul young girl. Makeup, very put together, casual dress. But she seemed to be upset, maybe distraught, and she was shaking, and as she sat down, she sat down and sat in the stool exactly the way the girls that I mentioned to you sat at Jeffrey’s house, with no expression and with their head down. But we could tell that she was very nervous. She claimed she had no idea how she had gotten to New York from “the island,” referring to Epstein’s compound in the U.S. Virgin Islands. A spokesperson for Dubin denies the allegations in the unsealed filing, calling them “demonstrably .” aposOver  girlsapos Juan Alessi, Espteinaposs house manager, testied that over a -year period that over  girls, who he was told were aposmassage therapistsapos, came to the house. He said that when cleaning up after a massage of Espstein or Maxwell he found vibrators and sex toys. The Black Book  Palm Beach Police confiscated an extensive lists of contacts with phone numbers from Maxwell and Epstein’s residence. Maxwell is claimed to have maintained a contact list in an approximately -page-long hard copy, which was openly available to other house employees. It consisted primarily of telephone numbers, addresses, or email addresses for ious personal friends, associates, employees, or personal or business connections of Epstein or her. There was also allegedly several sections entitled “Massage” alongside a geographical designation with names of females and corresponding telephone numbers. These numbers reportedly included those of underage females with no training in massage therapy. Trips to Thailand Maxwell allegedly told Virginia Giuffre she had to meet young girls in Thailand and bring them back to the U.S. for Epstein and her. She would write the girlsapos names down and arrange the times, it is claimed. Private island  Another alleged Epstein victim, Sarah Ransome, said that Maxwell and Epstein kept her passport when she was trafficked to his private island. She once allegedly tried to swim away before she was brought back. Reports have claimed that girls as young as  were taken there for sex with Epstein. There are allegations underage girls were used as sex slaves and repeatedly abused inside a temple on the island of Little St James, dubbed apospaedophile islandapos and aposorgy islandapos. He bought it more than two decades ago and created a high-security oasis, featuring the bizarre blue and white structure, complete with a gold dome, and a mansion. aposPaedo islandapos, as it has become known, has remained Epsteinaposs main home to date but been shrouded in mystery. The -acre island lies between St Thomas and St John, two of the largest islands of the US Virgin Islands in the Caribbean. Sinister theories have emerged about its use, with neighbours calling it our dark corner. The enormous stone mansion, with cream walls and a bright turquoise roof surrounded by maidsapos quarters was built first, followed by the temple topped with a gold dome. Speculation about the building, resembling a religious temple, has questionedit was used for the child sex abuse Epstein was accused of. A medieval-style lock on the front became a curious point of conversation for those working there, who suggested it could have been used to lock people inside with no escape. The front is flanked by statues painted in gold one which appears to be Poseidon, Greek god of the sea, and another that looks like a pair of birds. It is surrounded by palm trees and a terrace with a labyrinth mot. Friendship with Trump  In a  profile of Epstein from New York magazine, Donald Trump was quoted as saying: “I’ve known Jeff for  years. Terric guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is said that he likes beautul women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it - Jeffrey enjoys his social le. The now US President later said he had fallen out with Epstein but didnapost ulge why. Famous pals At the height of his success, Epstein counted the likes of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, Woody Allen and Prince Andrew among his social circle. Epstein would often ferry his powerful pals between his luxury residences on his private jet - a plane that would later be dubbed the Lolita Express by the press. Upbringing Born to working class parents and raised in Coney Island, Brooklyn, at the height of his influence in the s and early s Epstein had one of the biggest mansions in New York. Having dropped out of college without getting a degree, Epstein was hired to teach maths and physics at New Yorkaposs exclusive Dalton School. Ironically, the schoolaposs principal, Donald Barr, was the father of US Attorney General William Barr - the man who would have overseen Epsteinaposs prosecution. Epstein left the role after just two years after reportedly being scouted by Alan Greenberg, the chairman of investment bank Bear Stearns, while teaching his son.

On a hot summer night  years ago model and actress Sharon Tate was on the brink of a new le as an A-list movie star....and carrying a new le inside her. But the heavily pregnant we of film director Roman Polanski was about to have the leading role in a bloody, real-le horror story. For on August , , she was kned to death by members of the evil Manson Family cult, becoming a tragic icon of Hollywoodaposs greatest tragedy. In the past half century -year old Sharon has featured in more films and TV documentaries about the murder.  And now Quentin Tarantinoaposs blockbuster, Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, is bringing her story to a whole new generation – with Margot Robbie playing tragic Sharon. Yet while Tateaposs own sister, Debra, has praised the Aussie staraposs portrayal, many critics claim Texas-born Sharon has, once again, been unfairly portrayed as a sexy vixen – rather than the clever, compassionate talented actress about to take the movie world by storm. So who was Sharon, and how did she begin her Hollywood story  Born in Texas to an army officer dad, Sharon was entered into the first of many beauty contests at just six months old by her mother, Doris. She was crowned Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas and won other tournaments before moving to Italy where here dad was posted in her teens.  Her looks, charm, and grace won her her first two movie extra roles as well as modelling work and in  she ed to the US and moved to Los Angeles where she got an agent and began her TV and film career in earnest. In  she met and married Polanski and featured in numerous magazine shoots. In March that year Playboy magazine predicted “This is the year that Sharon Tate happens....” Here are her most famous films and roles... Barrabbas –   She had an uncredited role in a crowd scene in the religious movie shot in Italy.It starred Anthony Quinn as the criminal spared instead of Jesus Christ before his crucixion. Hemingwayaposs Adventures of a Young Man -     In another uncredited role Sharon played a burlesque queen in the adventure movie based on Ernest Hemingwayaposs semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams.She dated its star, Richard Beymer, who was  years her senior, and he helped her find an agent.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E –  She played a therapist in an episode called The Girls of Nazarone Affair.    Eye of the Devil -  Sharonaposs first major role came in playing beautul witch Odile in the occult horror film starring David Niven and Deborah Kerr.The producer also made a short accompanying documentary called All Eyes on Sharon Tate.It showed her on set, dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and contained a brief interview with her.Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, I donapost fool myself. I canapost see myself doing Shakespeare and spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy.    The Fearless Vampire Killers –  Roman Polanski cast Sharon as Sarah Shagal, a Transylvanian innkeepers daughter in the horror comedy he also starred in.But perfectionist Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Sharon and said in an interview that one scene had required  takes before he was satisfied. But as the film progressed her performance improved and her confidence grew.They began a relationship, and Sharon moved into Polanskiaposs London apartment after filming ended.  Donapost Make Waves –  Sharon ed to the US to play the role of a gorgeous surfer called Malibu in the American sex comedy with Tony Curtis.She wore a bikini for most of the film and, disappointed, began referring to herself sarcastically as sexy little me.The film opened to poor reviews and ticket sales, and Sharon confided in a reporter Itaposs a terrible movie. The Valley of the Dolls –  The film version of one of the all-time best-selling books was Sharonaposs big break – but she didnapost like the novel or the script.  She played Jenner North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body.Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly – and her nude scene attracted huge attention. But Sharon said: “I have no qualms about it at all. I donapost see any dference between being stark naked or fully dressed —itaposs part of the job and itaposs done with meaning and intention.I honestly donapost understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. Itaposs silly.On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they canapost watch two people in the very natural process of making love.Now, really, that doesnapost make any sense, does it  The role won Sharon a Golden Globe Nomination for most promising female newcomer. Wrecking Crew –   Her next role was as Freya Carson, a beautul but bumbling Danish tour guide and spy in the comedy film starring Dean Martin.She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by Bruce Lee The film was successful and brought her strong reviews for her comedic performance.

The existence of the lethal weapon, which allegedly has an unlimited range, was revealed during a speech to senators last year by Russian president Vladimir Putin .Last weekaposs incident near Severodvink led to a radiation aposspikeapos, according to civilian authorities, but Moscow has faced criticism for not releasing a full explanation of exactly what caused the blast. Respected analyst Yulia Latynina has claimed the weapon that exploded was an ultra-modern missile called the Burevestnik.    Putin described it as having an unlimited range and a nuclear engine, which fits the sparse information released in the wake of the incident. Russian officials have not named the precise missile involved. It is highly likely that this is the one that exploded, Latynina, a respected columnist, author and radio host, wrote in investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta. She dubbed the missile a small flying Chernobyl. If it was the Burevestnik, then the inner parts of its nuclear reactor - or, most likely, the liquid flowing there - ended up outside, she wrote.    This was just like the inner parts of the Chernobyl reactor which were thrown around the stationaposs territory by the explosion. US arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis has also suggested the blast could be related to the Burevestnik tests. Russiaaposs atomic agency Rosatom has revealed that a rocket engine test was underway and the accident involved isotope power sources. Separately, it has emerged that at least two corpses of top secret nuclear workers were blown into the sea by the force of the blast in the waters of the Nenoksa missile testing range. Three more bodies were recovered and will be buried on Monday. It is believed six injured scientists were moved to Moscow in ambulances with radiation protection. Latynina wrote: A flying nuclear reactor, evenyou isolate its active zone from the working body by the liquid zone, remains a small flying Chernobyl. Putin claimed last year that tests with the Burevestnik were successful, but this has been questioned by Western experts. Sources have said that only two tests out of  were partially successful by the start of this year. Last year, a CNBC report, citing US intelligence, claimed Russia was seeking to recover a nuclear-powered Burevestnik test missile that had crash landed in the Barents Sea, north of Norway and Russia. Reports suggest the new Russian weaponry threatens nuclear contamination.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb72b7a2643d-e1538733701970.jpg ","title":"dundee united coach mcculloch wants to keep momentum going against partick","story":"Assistant boss Lee McCulloch wants to see Dundee United gain some momentum by recording their second Championship win inside a week at Partick Thistle tonight.However, to do so, they’ll first have to snuff out the threat of a man he knows very well in veteran striker Kenny Miller.The pair worked on opposite sides of Tannadice Street in the final months of last season while Miller was at Dundee but, for years before that, they were team-mates at Rangers.From that time together, Lee knows, even at , the former Scotland striker is a force to be reckoned with.“Kenny is a threat. I played with him for years and years, and I know how good a player he was then. He’s still got that burst of pace, he’s still got the movement, the mentality and he is a leader on the pitch,” he said.“It’s going to be dficult to keep him quiet but we’ve got ways and means to do that.

I don’t know what’s going on there, we just need to concentrate on ourselves, get ourselves ready,” he said.United, meanwhile, are relaxed over their young talent being tracked by a string of clubs down south.Although they declined to comment on the matter, there has been contact from Crystal Palace who were willing to pay £, for Scott Banks.That was never close to their valuation and, right now, there is no need to sell any player.The likes of Louis Appere and Logan Chalmers have also been watched in recent weeks but they are very much seen as part of the future plans at Tannadice."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-anyone-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-can-recognise-old-pictures-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Times"},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elvis-presley-visits-prestwick-airport-pictures-glasgow-39-s-history","story":"A selection of images from the archives of the Herald and Times."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-leading-way-planet-saving-meat-free-movement","story":"GLASGOW is leading the way in encouraging the public to eat less meat as a new report warns lsquodrastic changesrsquo in human diet are needed to safeguard the planet."},{"url":null,"title":"report-reveal-extent-chemical-exposure-coatbridge-schools","story":"THE findings of a review into a school campus at the centre of health and safety concerns will be published later."},{"url":null,"title":"st-ambrose-buchanan-high-school-pupils-return-review-finds-blue-water-site-safe","story":"A school campus where parents had pulled their children from over health concerns has been deemed safe after an independent review."},{"url":null,"title":"nina-taylor-cohabiting-couples-cost-separation","story":"Letrsquos cohabit.

Calum Waters cross from the left headed over by Durmus.Main blazed a shot over from outside the area with  minutes played, having shrugged Gary Mackenzie off in the visitors’ first effort.The Dons interchanging midfield four of Wright, Ryan Hedges, Lewis Ferguson and McLennan wasn’t quite clicking for all their energy, with the man in possession being crowded out.Up the other end, big striker Jon Obika looked a real handful, with his pace, strength and aggression occupying Andy Considine and Scott McKenna.However, Hedges did find space to fire into Vaclav Hladky’s hands from  yards on  minutes, before Ferguson shot miles wide with a free-kick from  yards.Despite building a bit of pressure towards the end of the period, no more real chances materialised.Conversely, an  Andreu free-kick and Durmus overhead kick could’ve extended Saints’ lead, but were both caught by Lewis.Soon after play restarted, Main turned well with the ball and almost found the top left corner from range.On  minutes, Vyner got forward and delivered a pinpoint cross on to Ferguson’s head, and Hladky tipped over the bar.Three minutes later, the keeper threw himself on a deflected McLennan strike. However, he appeared to lt his hands from the ball, which Main stole and rolled into the net.Referee Steven McLean didn’t allow the equaliser – which would’ve been contentious – to stand.But it was a decent spell for Aberdeen, with Hladky punching a whipped Hedges free-kick clear soon after, before Sean McLoughlin looked to handle another of the attacker’s deliveries into the middle.Vyner was booked for protesting too vocerously for a penalty.Gaffer McInnes sent the rested Niall McGinn and Jon Gallagher on for McLennan and Wright in an attempt to force the issues for the Reds.But, on  minutes, St Mirren could’ve scored again, but Andreu somehow flicked Paul McGinn’s cross past the post.Ryan Flynn then went close with  minutes to go, ghosting inside, but shooting straight at Considine as he tried to find the inside of the front post.Kyle McAllister was next to try for the home side, and his long-range effort narrowly missed the top left corner.James Wilson was sent on for the Dons as they threw everything at the quick-countering Buddies to try and level it.The big chance of a frantic finish fell to substitute McGinn, from Considine’s cross, but he struck the outside of the post on the angle at the death."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d4a5547ddd092.61958284-63x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"aberdeen man climbs 50 munros in 150 days to raise cash for charlie house","story":"An Aberdeen man who challenged himself to climb  Munros in only  days has completed his goal.Bruce Russell, director at recruitment business Right People, is a keen hillwalker and often tackles around  to  Munros a year.Alongside his we Clare for many of the treks, he took on the gruelling task – raising more than £, for children’s charity Charlie House in the process.Charlie House supports children and young people with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions.He also often took along its mascot Charlie Dog for the journey.Bruce said: “This was a much bigger challenge than I expected but the thought of those who would benefit kept me going.“It’s such a worthwhile cause, I’m delighted I could contribute.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival. I’d also like to thank Seafood Scotland who helped with the funding of our equipment.‘Cooking in front of the boats which caught the fish was pretty spectacular.

It would be fair to say the midges enjoyed a feast, chewing both young people and their guests with vigour. But they didn#t dampen the spirits of the Scouts who were presented with numerous awards including Bronze, Silver and Gold Chief Scout Awards.The highlight of the evening was the presentation to Martha Payne of her Diamond Chief Scout Award, the second highest award in Scouting. Martha has been an enthusiastic and active member of the th Argyll for more than seven years.After gaining her award she said: #I have loved my time in Scouting – it has provided me with so many opportunities and memories.#Shortly after receiving her Diamond Chief Scout Award, Martha and her sister Polly, jetted off to join , other Scouts from around the world at the th World Scout Jamboree in West Virginia. This event is held every four years in dferent countries. The objective is to promote peace and understanding and to develop leadership and le skills in those attending.While Martha and Polly were in the United States, seven members of the th Argyll travelled to the world’s oldest rainforest in northern Malaysia to take part in a community development project with members of the Orang Asli tribe.The project had been organised by the West Region of Scouting in Scotland supported by the Yayasan EMKAY foundation. This charity exists to improve the living standards of the people living in this remote and challenging area. In total the group comprised  leaders and  explorersand networkerscompleting four projects.The projects included renovating a classroom to allow the villagers to attract a primary school teacher , building a playpark , preparing fields for planting of fruit trees, herbs and vegetables, and building a table for the elders to meet and discuss village business.Working in the rainforest was challenging with very high levels of humidity and temperatures regularly touching C. The whole group had an amazing adventure with memories and friendships formed that will last a letime.Finally, two members of the th Argyll had their first outings as members of the Mid Argyll Pipe Band. Robert Tonerand Martha Moirtook part in the recent Ardrishaig Gala Day.David Smart, Scout leader, th Argyll said: #This has been an amazing summer. We are so proud of all our members who have grasped the opportunities that Scouting provides. Scouting for the th is all about having adventures, whether small ones or big ones.#Last year we ran two camps for our Beavers, our Cubs attended the Adventure Centre at Lochgoilhead and won the District Camping competition, our Scouts completed a number of weekend camps including the Snowdrop Challenge Hike, and our Explorers had their first taste of ice climbing. Next year is our th birthday and we are planning a whole host of activities and adventures to mark this milestone.#John McCartan, chairman of the group, said: #Scouting in Mid Argyll is as strong as it has ever been. The leadership team, guided by the young people, have developed a fantastic programme in all of the sections.#We are keen that as many young people in Argyll take up the opportunities that Scouting provides. We have a stand at the forthcoming Mid Argyll Show and would be delighted to discuss our plans.#If you are interested in finding out more about the th Argyll Lochgilphead Scouts, email thargyllscouts@gmail or call  .The group runs four sections – Beavers , Cubs , Scoutsand Explorers .

There are  houses in Portincaple so this doubles the size of the community overnight.#Ms Baillie said: #I have met with representatives of the Portincaple Residents# Association and understand their concerns about the scale of the development.#I am happy to provide any assistance that I can in relation to the forthcoming planning application.#Oban High exclusions revealedOban High School had the highest amount of exclusions in Argyll and Bute last year, figures have revealed.A freedom of information request to Argyll and Bute Council revealed  temporary or permanent exclusions took place at the school.Physical assault with no weapon against a pupil was the most common exclusion offence at Oban High in  , responsible for  per cent of removals.There were  pupils excluded for verbal abuse of staff, while six were removed for general or persistent disobedience.Seven further exclusions were awarded for  offences listed as ‘other’.A total of  exclusions have taken place across the  secondary schools in Argyll and Bute since the start of the   academic year."},{"url":null,"title":"echoes of past glories on eve of 2019 farming showcase","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe  Mid Argyll Show offers a modern family day out # but the event has roots which run deep.There are many fantastic attractions for , including a dog show, vintage tractor displays, horse classes, home baking competitions, prosecco bar, mini rugby and a spectacular bike stunt team display.But the heart and soul of Mid Argyll Show remains with the farm livestock.The earliest records reveal that Mid Argyll Show goes back as far as , but there is little doubt that local farmers were proudly exhibiting their finest animals for many decades before then."},{"url":null,"title":"outdoor learning inspires creative craig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAfter leaving school, -year-old Craig MacIntyre from Kilmore, near Oban, took up an apprenticeship at the Stramash Outdoor Nursery.Throughout his training, Craig will undertake written and practical assessments, which will ultimately lead to an SVQ Social Servicesat SCQF Level .Craig’s mum, Katy, is a childminder, and so Craig has grown up with young children at home and he always enjoyed spending time with them.

For example, we have baskets and containers full of stones, shells, ribbons and seeds that we’ve collected.#The nursery site is among the trees so there are lots of leaves, twigs and branches too.#We encourage the children to freely develop their ideas with everything we have here andthey have an idea of something they want to create, we try as much as we can to help them to do it. Recently they wanted an obstacle course for the nursery, so we have created one with their help, using logs, tyres, rope and other pieces – they love it!#Being an outdoor nursery, we’re usually playing outside for most of the day and that’s what I love most about my job. Only on the wettest and windiest days do we use the huts for some shelter.#I think it makes a huge dference in a time when technology is being used more and more in education – with no electricity, wi or running water, the children are challenged to learn how to make things with little help.#I love seeing it when the wee ones learn something new or master something they’ve been trying to do for a while, like climb that little bit higher in the tree. It’s also really rewarding when the children see me outside of work and they run over to talk to me.#If I was to say one thing to somebody considering a career in early learning and childcare, I’d say go for it!

Ardrishaig Bothy was open and help was on hand to introduce youngsters to riding a bike, or brush up on their cycle control skills.

They joined some local bands who made sure toes were tapping from early morning until the end of the day.Of course, the main event was the ribbon cutting to formally open the Egg Shed and let the crowd who had gathered in Pier Square get a first look at the much-anticipated new building. Scottish Canals Chief Executive Catherine Topley together with Chief Executive of Argyll and Bute Council Cleland Sneddon addressed the crowd before enlisting the help of some young local helpers to help cut the ribbon and allow the first guests to flood in.As well as learning more about ‘Britain’s most beautul shortcut’, and its souvenir shop, the Egg Shed hosts a multi-purpose community space, free for the local community to use, which has a multitude of uses. It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended.

I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda. And almost exactly five years since the last one."},{"url":null,"title":"tom-gordon-labours-offer-referendum-sting-tail","story":"But seeing John McDonnell give Richard Leonard a metaphorical wedgie, not once but twice, was eye-popping stuff even for the Edinburgh Fringe.In March, Mr Leonard had been steadfast on independence. ldquoWe will not agree to a second independence referendum, he told the BBC. ldquoA Labour government... would not agree to a second independence referendum emerging from either the Scottish Parliament or from any other quarters.The shadow chancellor had other ideas. ldquoIt will be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide that. We would not block something like that, he declared.:Scottish Labour in meltdown over stance on second independence referendumHis bulldozing of Scottish party policy came out of the blue for Mr Leonard and his MSPs, but did not appear to be a casual remark. As one unhappy Labour MSP puts it: ldquoJohn McDonnell doesnrsquot make mistakes.Mr McDonnell had doubtless been reading Mondayrsquos poll from Lord Ashcroft which showed a lead for Yes.It also found that, despite leading Scottish Labour for more  days, around a third of voters have no opinion on Mr Leonard. They donrsquot know who he is. Just  per cent felt positively about the colourless crusader, less than Nigel Farage managed.With an election nigh, Mr McDonnell thought it best to show Nicola Sturgeon some love in case her MPs are needed to help a minority Labour government.In contrast, Mr Leonard, who has only ornamental value, and who in May helped Scottish Labour descend to % of the vote, was an afterthought.The backlash to Mr McDonnellrsquos intervention from some Scottish Labour MPs and MSPs has been spectacular.Some are truly angry at the party dropping its do-or-die Unionism, some are using the issue in a proxy war against Jeremy Corbyn, and many are furious at being the lsquobranch officersquo again.It has been an ungodly mess. The impression given to voters is that Scottish Labour canrsquot tie its own shoelaces.Mr Leonard, an authority-free zone, is confirmed as a washout of a leader.:John McDonnell ignores Richard Leonard and keeps independence referendum on the tableA poor, pale, watery creature, he gets sloshed around by forces he canrsquot control, like a jellyfish in a bucket.Most of his MSPs have tried to dig in, refusing to accept the policy change, but theyrsquore on a hiding to nothing.For despite all the mess, the needless aggro, the terrible PR, Mr McDonnellrsquos position is the realistic one. You canrsquot say Naw forever. At some point, Labour and the other Unionist parties will have to square up to a second referendum.I believe Mr McDonnell when he says he doesnrsquot want a referendum, and would oppose independenceanother vote took place. As Brexit has shown, losing a referendum not only costs the UK leader of the day their job, it also wrecks the governmentrsquos agenda.Mr McDonnell and Mr Corbyn havenrsquot come this close to power only to watch their plans being shoved aside by years of negotiations over independence.They could, like Theresa May and the Scottish Labour ultras, simply refuse to engage, and risk watching support for Yes climb ever higher. Or they could grasp the thistle and start thinking about what to do while the odds are still -.True, this is all far sooner than Labour would want. But the five years since  have been extraordinarily turbulent. To paraphrase Facebookrsquos staff motto, politics now moves fast and breaks things. If the public mood is moving towards Yes, it cannot be ignored.There were also clues to how Labour - or the Tories - might respond this week.Mr McDonnell gave one. ldquoLet us demonstrate as a Labour government what we can do to transform peoplersquos lives. And , after a few years, people want to come back and say they want to test the water on an independence referendum, well fair enough.In other words, a Labour government would play for time. It wouldnrsquot block Indyref, but nor would it hurry it along. It would hope the public mood shted after the Tories were ousted and Labour had a chance to promote federalism.That ldquoafter a few years is their version of Mrs Mayrsquos ldquonow is not the time.Of course, Nicola Sturgeon would not wait a few years. The First Minister would ask for a vote in , citing her ldquocast-iron mandate and brandishing a vote by SNP and Green MSPs. Here too, Labour has a get-out. Shadow Scottish minister Paul Sweeney says there is no mandate as those MSPs were elected on dferent manestos. He has a point.:Labour would not block a second Scottish independence referendumThe SNP position was conditional on ldquoa signicant and material change in circumstances... such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will.But the Greens suggested a m-signature petition as the trigger.Their manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. Itrsquos a muddled, mongrel mandate that would let a UK government parry the FM until .Which brings us to the next line of Unionist defence. Mr McDonnell, Mr Sweeney, the Labour MSP Neil Findlay and former Scottish Secretary David Mundell all identied the Holyrood election as pivotal this week. Mr Mundell described it as a referendum on whether to have a second referendum.Hinting at tactical alliances, he said: ldquoAll Unionist forces have to think about how best to organise themselves for that election. He and the Labour politicians also said thatthe SNP and Greens wanted to claim a clear and decisive mandate for Indyref, they should fight the election on an explicit commitment to holding it. That would focus Unionist opposition.If the SNP and Greens won a majority there would then be haggling over the form of the referendum. There would be no rerun of , when Alex Salmond was given a relatively free hand. Mr Sweeney said Labour would block a Yes No question and include a federal UK in a multiple-choice ballot. A Tory government might offer more devolution as a third way. David Cameron only insisted on a binary question in  because he thought the Unionists would romp it. The calculation is very dferent now. The UK government would be looking for ways to split the Yes vote.If, after all that, voters did back independence, therersquos another catch. Mr Findlay, who was Mr Corbynrsquos point man in Scotland for a while, said that whatever deal emerged from the negotiations between Edinburgh and London should go to ldquoa confirmatory vote of the Scottish people. As some SNP MPs have warned, Ms Sturgeon would struggle to object as she supports a confirmatory vote on Brexit.So while Mr McDonnellrsquos comments are signicant, they are not the whole story. Obstacles are being piled up in Ms Sturgeonrsquos path - the  election, a novel form of referendum, a confirmatory vote. While Unionists would only have to prevail in one of the three to scupper her plans, the First Minister would have to win the treble."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-week-global-water-shortages","story":"Recent data released by the World Resources Instituteshow that % of the worlds population are at risk of running out of water.More than a billion people currently live in water-scarce regions, and as many as . billion could experience water scarcity by , according to the WRI.Even countries with relatively low risk of water stress could face a future with severely restricted access to water.What does the report say The WRIs Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas helps businesses and governments identy and evaluate water risks around the world and its latest data has has revealed that  countries are facing \"extremely high\" water stress.From Botswana to India to Iran, agriculture and industry are sucking up % of the available surface and groundwater every year, according to the report, a tool that ranks water stress, drought risk and riverine flood risk across  countries.What do the findings mean The report says that even \"small dry shocks,\" which the charity says will likely increase due to global heating, will produce \"dire consequences.\"WRI president and CEO Dr Andrew Steer said in a statement:\"Water stress is the biggest crisis no one is talking about.

Growing populations are degrading fresh water resources and aquatic ecosystems.WRI found that global water withdrawals have more than doubled since the s due to growing demand.Even water-rich countries rely on other nations to provide for their needs.

Doubtless thatrsquos why on Friday the Chinese government brought former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing out of retirement, in a move that is said to have ldquostunned Hong Hongrsquos law enforcement community.While serving as commissioner it was Lau who, back in , oversaw operations when protesters demanding greater democracy occupied key roads for  straight days.In , it was Lau who also took charge of the crackdown on illegal hawkers in the cityrsquos busy Mong Kok district sparking riots that were also seen to be politically motivated and became widely known as the ldquoFishball Revolution.Once again it seems the senior policeman with the ldquohands on reputation has been brought in to quell political dissent on Hong Kongrsquos streets.Laursquos appointment on ldquospecial duty came as the cityrsquos embattled police force geared up for three days of sit-in protests at Hong Kong International Airport, starting from Friday and culminating today.However, no-one for a moment believes that it will mark the end of almost nine weeks of anti-government rallies that have frequently ended in violent clashes with police.What began as a movement against an extradition bill, which would have let criminal suspects in Hong Kong be handed over for trial by communist party-controlled courts in mainland China, has since evolved into the biggest challenge from dissenters since the Tiananmen protests  years ago that still reverberate to this day.Today, just like back then, the appointment of veteran chief police officer Alan Lau Yip-shing indicates that the Chinese authorities are in no mood for compromise.That much was made clear by an official from the Chinese governmentrsquos Hong Kong office, who last week warned, ldquowe would like to make clear to the very small group of unscrupulous and violent criminals and the dirty forces behind them: those who play with fire will perish by it.In that one statement lie clues to much of the fear, paranoia and disinformation that have been the hallmark of this latest crisis in Hong Kong.To begin with, far from being the work of a small group, hundreds of thousands of ordinary people have taken to the cityrsquos streets, eventhose numbers have dwindled of late.Reports of alleged criminal involvement suggest that rather than such malign forces lurking within the ranks of the protesters, itrsquos perhaps been the Chinese authorities which have deployed Triad gang members to do their violent bidding in Hong Kong.Last month, a large group of masked men carrying wooden sticks and iron rods began attacking protesters, journalists and passengers indiscriminately at the cityrsquos Yuen Long MTR railway station leaving scores injured.It later came to light that some of the attackers were indeed triad members and were known to senior pro-establishment politician Junius Ho Kwan-yiu.ldquoThe thugs who carried out the Yuen Long attacks have only served to convince the public that triad societies are a dangerous resource available to those wishing to engage them, wrote Justin Bong-Kwan in the South China Morning Postin the wake of the attacks.Like other observers he points out that Hong Kong triads have a long history of political involvement and \"thugs for hire\" is nothing new.Back in , when deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing was tasked with policing the violence during the Occupy protests, unknown gangs from neighbouring Guangdong province in China staged a similar attack at a night market, beating up protesters.Commenting on the current situation, Lynette H Ong, a China expert at the University of Toronto, says that ldquothugs for hire offer an expedient strategy to intimidate protesters and allow authorities to skirt responsibility for any violence that may take place. ldquoShort of rolling in tanks, outsourced violence arguably may be the most effective means to ward off protesters, wrote Ong recently in the Washington Post.Not that anyone has ruled out the possibility of troop deployment should the crisis deepen.But would China really send in the Peoplersquos Liberation Armyand deploy tanks on Hong Kongrsquos streets should the situation worsen A recent propaganda video from the Chinese armyrsquos Hong Kong garrison showing troops quelling civil unrest along with a similar large-scale police drill just across the mainland border were hardly subtle in their messaging.In one scene, a soldier is seen shouting ldquoAll consequences are at your own risk! as protesters are seen retreating before a phalanx of troops. Comments from officials and state media denouncing the protesters as ldquocriminals, crossing ldquoredlines through ldquointolerable violence along with the oppressive nature of the Beijing regime and the communist partyrsquos willingness to use force, must linger in the minds of many who take to Hong Kongrsquos streets.It all adds to the perception that Beijing wants to convey and never fails to repeatedly remind the public that Hong Kong law allows for PLA troops to ldquoassistrequested by the cityrsquos government.Many people in Hong Kong believe that the territoryrsquos leader Carrie Lam has become a lame duck as the political crisis has spiralled, with Beijing now fully calling the shots from behind the scenes. Lam has rarely been seen in public in recent weeks and at her most recent appearance was flanked by a number of colleagues.But despite Beijingrsquos ability to call things as it sees it, most analysts or indeed Hong Kong people themselves believe that the chances of PLA soldiers leaving their barracks for deployment on the streets soon are slim.They point to the fact that Hong Kong still has  years to go of its One Country, Two Systems whereby it transitions from its British past to its Chinese future while allowing freedoms unheard of on the mainland.ldquoItrsquos a political problem, I donrsquot think sending in a security force would effectively deal with it, was how Adam Ni, a Chinese military researcher at Macquarie University summed it up to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation recently.Analysts also say Chinarsquos deeply strained relations with Western nations, particularly the US, would also act as a retraining factor on president Xi Jinpingrsquos regime in Beijing.But this has not stopped Chinese officials and Communist Party media insisting that Western ldquoblack hands and a US covert role are behind the protests.On Thursday and Friday, Beijing-backed media outlets circulated a photograph of Julie Eadeh, the political unit chief of the US consulate general in Hong Kong, meeting in a hotel lobby with prominent members of the opposition, including -year-old Joshua Wong, a key figure in the protests that rocked Hong Kong five years ago.Chinese State broadcaster CCTV has also insisted that the Central Intelligence Agencywas known for instigating ldquocolour revolutions, a reference to demonstrations that sprang up in former Soviet states during the previous decade.Beijing officials also said this week that the Hong Kong unrest had the markings of a colour revolution.According to Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African studiesUniversity of London, the propaganda attacks represented a classic Communist Party influence effort to shore up public opinion in Hong Kong.ldquoThat is exactly what they would call the United Front approach. We would call it ide and rule, Tsang said, referring to the Communist Party wing that is responsible for political influence campaigns in China and abroad.ldquoThey want to isolate the protesters from the bulk of the Hong Kong population and say, lsquoThis is all about foreign interference,rsquo Tsang told the Washington Post.Beijingrsquos relationship with with Hong Kong and its people has always been an evolving one. Seen even from a purely economic perspective Chinarsquos attitude has changed considerably in recent times.At the time of the handover in , the territoryrsquos economy was equivalent to nearly one-fth of Chinarsquos. Today the figure is %, and Hong Kongrsquos port is far less important in shipping goods from the mainland.China is simply no longer as directly dependent on the territory for its economic welfare as it once was, when foreign firms operating from Hong Kong, managerial expertise and access to international markets via its port were critical.For the moment such wider economic concerns and geopolitics will have little bearing on the day-to-day running of the protests still taking place on Hong Kongrsquos streets after two months.While the absolute number of protesters has fallen from an estimated two million who marched, largely peacefully, on June  to , strikers, they continue to be thorn in the side of the authorities. Much has been made of the remarkable and often ingenious tactics they have adopted in confronting the police.Almost daily thousands have adopted what has been described as near ldquoguerrilla tactics that often involve a series of ldquoflash mob events designed to distract and confuse the authorities.ldquoOur aim is not to let the police arrest us. We need to be like water, one protester was quoted as saying while on the streets last week.ldquoBe water, my friend ndash a take on a famous Bruce Lee quote to be ldquoformless, shapeless, like water ndash has been a rallying cry of the leaderless movement.The fluid tactics of the black-clad vanguard of protesters mean donrsquot gather in one place, where you can be encircled donrsquot have clear leaders who can be arrested ebb and flow the demonstrations to keep officials confused. Many carry laser pointers to \"shoot\" at public security cameras to disable them such is the fear of being identied and arrested.Almost all of those who now come on to the streets are equipped with helmets, goggles and gas masks to ward off the more than , rounds of tear gas fired over the nine weeks of protest.Hong Kongersrsquo experience of resistance has made the protests sharply effective.ldquoProtesters experience these illegal protests the same way soldiers often describe war -long periods of boredom punctuated by terrying episodes of violence, wrote Trey Menefee, a Hong Kong-based social scientist in Foreign Policy magazine around the time the current protests began.ldquoThe key is to determine when the police will move, where theyrsquoll come from, and what tactics theyrsquoll likely use. Most protesters have learned from experience the importance of knowing when to fall back and not to get caught somewhere without a predetermined exit route, Menefee explained.Many observers of events on the streets say the willingness of some protesters to fight back in the face of police violence is a marked contrast to the ldquoextremely well-behaved, peaceful Umbrella Movement of , when students occupied public spaces and streets outside regional government offices for  days.ldquoThis time there are no leaders. Just anonymous people, groups of friends, civil society and an army of volunteers organising everything: medics, food and drinks, all kind of anti-riot protective gear, volunteers to drive protesters late at night, says Gallego Abellan, a video and photojournalist who spoke with the online US-based portal The Intercept.ldquoPeople leave money in the machines that sell subway tickets for those that canrsquot pay, volunteers bring clothes so people can change after the demonstration and not be identied as protesters.\"Therersquos even a group of mothers that help those youth involved in the protest that need any kind of assistance, explains Abellan.Yesterday, the ersity of those making up the protesters ranks was once again visible on the streets with some arriving back at Hong Kongrsquos airport a day after a peaceful gathering there of about , activists.Hundreds occupied the arrivals hall yesterday, some of them sitting on the floor drawing protest posters, while others politely greeted arriving passengers.In the morning, in two separate protests, small groups of elderly Hong Kongers and families marched near the financial centrersquos business district.Both marches unlike many of the rallies of late were peaceful. Few doubt things will remain that way for long though.In less than a fortnightrsquos time those on the streets will surpass rsquos -day Umbrella Movement democracy protests. While those protests had largely fizzled out by the end, there are few signs of the same happening this time around with the movement remaining fiery and determined.What ultimately they will achieve remains to be seen, butone thing is certain itrsquos that Hong Kong politically will never be the same again.The recalling of tough former deputy police commissioner Alan Lau Yip-shing out of retirement to deal with the situation, might just be an ominous sign of things to come."},{"url":null,"title":"love-living-edinburgh-festival-time","story":"But donrsquot believe the hype or the viral tweets. Irsquom Edinburgh born and bred ndash and I love it. How can you not Walking around the buzzing streets of the Old Town, I still get a kick out of watching tourists hold up the traffic as they rub Greyfriars Bobbyrsquos nose or take shedloads of selfies in front of the cafe where JK Rowling wrote the first Harry Potter novel. Irsquom more than happy to politely point them in the direction of the castle or down the mound, watching their bemused faces as I explain what seems obvious to me but confusing to them, that Edinburgh is built on two levels.Even when the weather is a bit miserable, Irsquove found myself halfway down the Royal Mile, standing as part of a huge circle of people from all over the world, captivated by an Australian street performer. It may be pouring with rain and wersquove all got wet feet but together wersquore laughing and clapping as a small, unsuspecting child is roped in to the finale.Itrsquos fun to walk where I spent my school days mucking about with my pals with the advantage of knowing where to duck and e, find the stillness among the madness, or take the short cut that is technically a long cut, but takes less time because no-one  knows to go that way. As I eavesdrop on the conversations of tourists gushing in  languages over how beautul the ancient spires are, I smile to myself with a sense of pride, almost asI built the Old Town with my own hands.Edinburgh is magical all the time but the transformation it undertakes to become the worldrsquos biggest arts playground really is something , and I get a kick out of seeing how the city comes together as old buildings change into unrecognisable pop-up theatres and bars.The financials are pretty transformative too, of course. Attracting an audience of more that . million, the Edinburgh Festivals bring in pound million to the Scottish economy each year, a substantial proportion of the tourist revenue for Scotland. It also accounts for more than , jobs in the ever-competitive creative industries.Thatrsquos not to say everything is hunky dory, of course, and more voices than ever before are highlighting the other side of the cityrsquos success. I have personal experience, too. During my time at the University of Edinburgh, it was the standard to be forced out of your student flat during August, replaced by festival visitors willing to pay two monthrsquos rent and more for just one week.Two years after graduating I am still living at home with my mother because Edinburgh rents remain so incredibly expensive, with long-term residents and renters priced out in favour of short-term holiday lets. There are reported to be a staggering , short-term lets in the city, more than half of Scotlandrsquos total in a city of under ,. One in  homes in the city centre are thought to be holiday lets.I understand a proposed tourist tax is controversial, but it already exists in many European cities and would provide a welcome financial boost to infrastructure. It would perhaps also encourage visitors to treat the city with a bit more care, perhaps refraining from urinating in public and leaving their rubbish on our streets and on public transport.During these times of political and social uncertainty, the arts remain a vital way to entertain, bring people together and celebrate the world around us. As someone who grew up and went to school in the north of Edinburgh, next to some of the most deprived areas in Scotland, the Festival can leave some residents feeling a bit like visitors in their own home.Year on year the Festival has grown, and it has been nice to see it spill out from the Royal Mile and southside areas towards the New Town and Leith. This allows the small, local and independent business outside the central area to profit from the cityrsquos extra footfall.For local communities, even with a venue now on your doorstep, ticket prices average at about pound-pound, which would set a family of four back at least pound, a disposable income that is only available to those in more affluent areas.I would feel less annoyedthe performers and artists themselves were profiting from the ticket prices. The Festival, particularly the Fringe, is seen as a rite of passage for those who want to pursue a long-term career in the arts. Many arrive in Edinburgh, excited and energised, hopeful for a career-defining review, often self-funded or with some financial support in the form of a grant or bursary. They do not expect to make a profit. They often make a loss, with the venues and promoters raking it in.Many, many people make this festival happen. Most are young and keen, and get little financial reward for their graft. Itrsquos not unusual to sign a contract that means it is legal for them to only have one day off a week during the month of August, with others putting in -hour days at venues infor a pass that allows them to see shows for free.When you consider the legacy of what the Festival was meant to achieve when it was set up more than  years ago, it leaves a bittersweet taste in your mouth. Thatrsquos not to say there arenrsquot positive developments, of course, especially on the ersity front.This year, an initiative called Fringe of Colour, established by Edinburgh University student Jess Brough, has partnered with venues to provide tickets to local people of colour under  to see shows that feature performers of colour, an attempt to fight back against the lack of racial ersity in both performers and audiences.The Edinburgh International Book Festival, meanwhile, is offering a ldquopay what you can option for some of its events and free alternatives can also be found in the Book Fringe and Free Fringe.Despite my frustrations, I love the Festival for the culture, fun and good energy it brings to my city in August. I couldnrsquot imagine being anywhere . After all, where  would you experience such amazing things Just the other night I watched a trans, non-binary person of colour, Travis Alabanza, take up space on the stage of the Traverse Theatre, with the spectacular Burgerz. The night before, I sat in the front row at Edinburgh Universtiyrsquos Bedlam Theatre to watch Splintered, a cabaret about being queer and Caribbean.I felt proud of both of these performances for challenging an audience that tends to be white, middle-class and incredibly privileged.Last year, I saw a group of Australian men performing burlesque cabaret in a building that was originally built as a college for the Free Church of Scotland.You canrsquot get that in Glasgow, can you  Not yet.Keep your sanity and avoid the crowds this Festival If yoursquore in among the madness, grab a coffee from Thomas J Walls on Forrest Road. From the street it may look busy but the cafeacute goes quite far back and there is a good chance yoursquoll be able to snag one of the sofas, close your eyes and pretend yoursquore anywhere but Edinburgh. Wander down Leith Walk for a drink at one of the many pubs or bars without an Oxbridge accent in range. Smoke  Mirrors on Constitution Street is a favourite. Get some fresh air by climbing Arthurrsquos seat or Calton Hill, the latter being a much easier walk and offering a better view. Yoursquoll be able to see how busy and beautul the city is without being right in it. If it all really gets too much, leave the city and go west. Trains to Glasgow run frequently and take less than an hour from Waverly station. But no, Irsquom not telling you where you can get a pint for pound. ndash thatrsquos a secret for Edinburgh locals only!"},{"url":null,"title":"80-years-wizard-oz","story":"ORIGINSBEFORE the Munchkin orgies, before the director slapped Judy Garland, before the Wicked Witch nearly burned to death, The Wizard of Oz was a day-dream in the mind of a two-time loser called L Frank Baum.Baum was born rich but flunked most things he tried - his store lsquoBaumrsquos Bazaarrsquo, and a newspaper he ran, both failed. However, he loved children, and he loved writing. Baum wanted a daughter - he planned to call her Dorothy - but when his first child Frank was born in , Baum began inventing stories to entertain him, stories which would eventually be published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in August , with  sequels following.Baum was unsuccessfully adapting his Oz stories into films in the early years of Hollywood when he died at his home, Ozcot, in Calornia in . Twenty years later, in , Hollywood would finally work its magic on Baumrsquos creation and turn The Wizard of Oz into the most celebrated and influential film in cinema history.This week the movie marks its th anniversary. For a film which moulded the childhoods of millions, the story of how this strange fairytale came to the screen is far from kid-friendly. In fact, at times, itrsquos strictly for adults only.THE STUDIOIN , Louis B Mayer, the mogul who headed -Goldwyn-Mayer, the most glittering of Hollywoodrsquos dream factories, bought the rights to The Wizard of Oz for ,. The plan was to make a movie rivalling Disneyrsquos game-changing Snow White. MGM marked Oz lsquoProduction Number rsquo. It cost nearly m to make and was one of the most expensive productions ever, taking nearly  years to turn a profit. The filmrsquos lyricist, Yip Harburg, said the studio never banked on Oz making money: lsquoOnce a year they did a loser for prestige.In the s, the studio system ran Hollywood. Directors, writers, and actors were all lsquoownedrsquo by one of the big studios like MGM or Columbia. Studio bosses had final say, and below them the producer was king, not the director. Writers were told what movies to work on, as were directors and actors.Herman Mankiewicz, whorsquod go on to win an Oscar for Citizen Kane, was the first of ten writers attached to Oz. An alcoholic, his major contribution was the idea that the film should be shot in black and white when Dorothy is in Kansas, but in colour when shersquos in Oz. The American poet Ogden Nash stepped in briefly after Mankiewicz was taken off the project, but it was third writer Noel Langley, aged just , who made the script his own, and created much of the story, including the ruby slippers - although they were originally silver. However, he also had sprawling side stories involving the Wicked Witchrsquos son lsquoBulborsquo, which were later cut.Summer leaves: Scotlandrsquos top writers select their favourite literary fragmentsLangley, however, would see his career ruined by studio boss Mayer. After shooting ended, Langley was heard to publicly say: ldquoEvery time Mayer smiles at me, I feel a snake has crawled over my foot. He was blacklisted and couldnrsquot get another job for any studio.Langley watched the movie alone in a cinema on Hollywood Bouled when it was released. ldquoI sat and cried like a bloody child, he said. ldquoI loathed the picture. He wasnrsquot alone. The New Yorker called it a ldquostinkeroo. As Aljean Harmetz says in her book The Making of The Wizard of Oz: ldquoMost of the serious critics thought it dreadful.THE MUSICThe wrong man got the Oscar. When Oz won the Academy Award for Best Original Score it went to Herbert Stothart - house composer for MGM. The only problem was he hadnrsquot written any of the songs - the real work was done by lyricist and composer Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen. But under the studio system jobbing songwriters were treated as badly as jobbing screenwriters.Arlen and Harburg - later blacklisted as a communist during the McCarthy era - were paid a flat rate of , and given a bungalow at MGM to live and work in. Their first task was tackling ldquothe lemon drop songs - light, catchy tunes like Ding Dong the Witch is Dead and Wersquore Off to See the Wizard. Some tunes, like If I Only Had a Brain, had already been written for other musicals and just needed new lyrics.The idea for the filmrsquos anthem, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, came to Arlen when he drove past Schwabrsquos Drugstore on Sunset Bouled - a place that summed up the songrsquos sense of longing. The drugstore was famous for the wannabe movie stars who hung out there, and the legend that a beautul girl could get an agent before she finished her milkshake at the soda fountain.After his first preview of the movie, though, Mayer pulled Over the Rainbow from the film asking: ldquoWhy does she sing in a barnyard . Harburg and Arlan were horried. Harburg said the studio bosses were ldquoignorant jerks. Eventually, Mayer relented and allowed the song to remain. Other songs were not so fortunate - The Jitterbug took five weeks to shoot and cost pound, but ended up on the cutting room floor for the first release.As the filmrsquos biographer Aljean Harmetz says: ldquoWhat is most remarkable about the Wizard of Oz - and perhaps the mark of its success - is that one doesnrsquot really think of it as a musical.THE STARSMGM was famous for having ldquomore stars than there are in heaven. Judy Garland was one of  actors under contract with the studio when she was hired in , aged , on  a week. It was the beginning of a career which would bring Garland fame and adoration, as well as abject mental and physical suffering. She was a raw and sensational talent but not conventionally beautul, and in the Hollywood of the s that meant ldquothe teeth capped, the nose restructured, the thick waist held in by corsets, and the body reshaped as well as possible by diet and massage - as Aljean Harmetz describes how Mayer moulded his young star.The mogul even referred to Garland as his ldquolittle hunchback. He initially didnrsquot want her in Oz and tried to secure Shirley Temple, but she was under contract with th Century Fox. The trials and humiliations of child stardom led to a letime struggle with drink and drugs for Garland - eventually leading to her death, after a number of suicide attempts, by an accidental barbiturate overdose aged .Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley - who played the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - were all seasoned vaudeville stars on higher salaries than Garland. Bolger was on  a week. Haley was a last minute replacement. Initially, Buddy Ebsen - who went on to star in the The Beverly Hillbillies - was cast as the Tin Man, but an allergy to aluminium make-up nearly killed him, and Haley stepped in.WC Fields was the first call for playing the Wizard - but he wanted too much cash, asking pound,, so Frank Morgan begged the studio for the role. Morgan was not a star, but a charming alcoholic. He carried a briefcase filled with Martinis so he was never without a drink. In an astonishing coincidence, a frock coat bought from a second hand store for Morganrsquos costume was found with a label stitched inside - it read lsquoL Frank Baumrsquo, and was authenticated as the writerrsquos. When shooting wrapped, Morgan gave the coat to Baumrsquos widow.The Wicked Witch might have turned out very dferentproducer Mervyn Le Roy had his way - he wanted a glamorous villainess, all sequins and figure-hugging dresses. Studio bosses scotched the idea, and the role fell to Margaret Hamilton who made the part her own.Hamilton was a -year-old single mother who, although shersquos terried generations of children, is recalled by all who knew her as a kind, gentle, clever and funny woman. Playing the Good Witch Glinda was Billie Burke, the bejewelled we of Florenz Ziegfield, of Ziegfield Follies fame. When her husband died leaving her half a million in debt, Burke turned to the movies to stay afloat. Burkersquos dressing room had satin walls and a pink chaise-longue, Hamiltonrsquos was a canvas tent.:Brian Cox on bringing Logan Roy and Succession home to ScotlandThere was one final star to cast: Toto - played by Terry, a female Cairn Terrier, who suffered from chronic shyness. Despite a tendency to hide when there was loud noises, Terry was hired on pound a week. By that stage of her career, -year-old Garland was on pound.THE MUNCHKINSldquoWe had a hell of a time with those little guys, producer Mervyn LeRoy recalled. ldquoThey got into sex orgies at the hotel. We had to have police on every floor hellip Everything you can imagine sexually was going on.Screenwriter Noel Langley remembers ldquoshowgirls being escorted to their rooms by armed guards. Judy Garland once said: ldquoThey were drunks. They got smashed every night and the police had to pick them up in butterfly nets.Others described the Munchkins as an ldquounholy assemblage of pimps, hookers, and gamblers.One Munchkin actor bit a policeman, a few were known to carry knives, and some female Munchkin actors did solicit the crew. But as the filmrsquos biographer Aljean Harmetz says most were well-behaved. ldquoMemories are distorted because the activities of [a] few hellip were applied to all the Munchkins.In fact, many - whorsquod been exploited and abused due to their disabilities - were shy and vulnerable. This was the era when most of the  little people needed for the film could be hired from a company called lsquoSingerrsquos Midgetsrsquo, on five dollars a day.The lsquobig worldrsquo was also dangerous. Attendants were hired to take some to the bathroom after one actor fell down a toilet and couldnrsquot get out.SHOOTINGOz had four directors. Richard Thorpe for two weeks, George Cukor for three days, and King Vidor for ten days - but it was Victor Fleming who got the credit and put in the most work over four months. Fleming also took the Best Picture Oscar from Oz with his other film of  Gone With the Wind.Fleming was macho to the bone. He shot wild cats outside his Bel Air home, and had a particularly vile party trick of killing flies and eating them. He was a flamboyant anti-communist with his own plane, and infamous for womanising. During one confrontation on set, Fleming lost his temper with Garland who was unable to stop laughing at the clowning of Lahrrsquos Lion.John Lee Mahin, a screenwriter friend of Fleming who was on set, recalled: ldquoThey must have done the scene ten times and eventually she was giggling so much she got hysterical. She couldnrsquot stop laughing. And Vic slapped her on the face. lsquoAll right now,rsquo he said, lsquogo back to your dressing room.rsquo She went. And when she came back she said, lsquoOk.rsquo And they did the scene.The shooting was exhausting and gruelling - especially for the Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow who suffered through y make-up sessions and baking arc lights. By lunchtime, with their make-up melting, the crew found them so ldquodisgusting to look at that the three ate alone in their dressing room.Garlandrsquos breasts were bound with cloth to keep her looking pre-pubescent, causing her considerable pain, but she never complained. Many of the crew worked round the clock and the place was awash in alcohol.Filming was plagued by accidents - thanks to the demanding and physical special effects. Betty Danko, stunt double for Margaret Hamilton, was crushed on set. Hamilton was badly injured when she caught fire during a scene where the witch disappears in a puff of smoke. Her face was burned and the skin on one hand completely removed, exposing the nerves. She was unable to film for six weeks. When she ed, Fleming grasped her so hard by the injured hand that she almost fainted.LEGACYAlthough the film has earned billions to date, it initially made a loss of about m at the box office. However, its real legacy isnrsquot financial but cultural. Its simple message of family, hope and home caught the imagination of a public about to face six years of war in Europe. Its arrival on TV at Christmas from the s to the s secured its place in the hearts of babyboomers and Generation Xers. The gay community embraced Garland as a suffering icon.Director David Lynch once said Oz influenced every film made since . His own movie Wild At Heart is a love letter to Oz. Steven Spielbergrsquos AI is Oz reimagined with robots. Musicians have been inspired by it, like Elton John with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. If therersquos a list of all time great movies, Oz is there, usually at the top. Its words and symbols, songs and ideas are weaved into everyday le. How often do you hear someone say lsquoWersquore not in Kansas anymorersquo, or refer to a villain as lsquothe Wicked Witch of the Westrsquo. The Wizard of Oz has shaped our imaginations from childhood to adulthood - which is why even at the ripe old age of  it will continue to live on long after all of us have quit the stage.Ray Bolger the Scarecrow said it was the moviersquos ldquosimple philosophy which made it immortal: ldquoTherersquos no place like home, everybody has a heart, everybody has a brain, everybody has a soul."},{"url":null,"title":"piping-glasgow-plays-part-hosts-world-championships","story":"More than  pipe bands will be taking part,  of whom will be fighting for the supreme title. Not forgetting the Highland dancers, also competing for their top world award.One of the other nations competing to claim the origin of the pipes is Ireland. The reigning world champions ndash The Field Marshal Montgomery Pipe Band ndash hail from Lisburn in the northern part of the island. They arenrsquot just defending their title but can lay claim to being the most successful band of all time, with  Worlds and innumerable other titles. But before the main course, therersquos the entreacutee, the dozens of events organised by the National Piping Centre, the city overlaid with the skirl of the pipes.How the pipes came to Scotland is a bit of a puzzle. Some historians believe they originated in Egypt, before coming over with invading Roman Legions. Others claim they came across the Irish Sea with colonising Scots tribes.As early as  BC, the ldquopipes of Thebes were played in Ancient Egypt. These seemed to involve some blowing into hollow pipes made of dog skin with chanters of bone. A few centuries later, Emperor Nero is also believed to be a keen piper, so he was probably blowing, rather than fiddling, as Rome burned. Whoever invented them, we owned them. The original Highland pipes probably had a single drone, with a second drone added in the mid-s and the third, the great dronecame into use some time in the early s.At the time Lowland pipers were travelling minstrels, performing at feasts and fairs throughout the Borders. Highland pipers, on the other hand, held a loftier and more austere position within the clan system. By the late s, the pipes had replaced the harp, as the guitar would do later to just about every instrument.The first recorded entrance of the pipes as an instrument of war was in the last full-scale battle against the English which, closer to home, also involved religion. It was the Battle of Pinkie, which took place outside Musselburgh in , when the Scots army was defeated, aided by the guns of  English warships anchored in the Forth which decimated their ranks.It was a crucial turn in what was to became known the War of Rough Wooing. After breaking from Rome and Catholic Europe, an isolated King Henry VIII had wanted his son, Prince Edward, to marry the young Scottish Queen Mary and united two kingdoms. When Henry died and the boy became King Edward VI, his uncle, the Duke of Somerset, became Lord Protector of England and pursued the idea of an alliance ndash wanted or not ndash with the Scots, who still clung to the papacy. When the Scots battlelines crumbled there was no mercy and it is estimated that around , Scottish soldiers perished. Mary was smuggled out of Scotland and,  years later, married Francis, Dauphin of France.Due to their inspirational influence the pipes were classied as an instrument of war and banned for a time after the Battle of Culloden in . There has barely been a war, a battle or skirmish since that hasnrsquot involved a band, or piper, particularly as the British Empire expanded and Scottish soldiers, and pipers led regiments into battles in foreign fields.One of the most famous and oldest pipe tunes, the Green Hills of Tyrol, dates to the Crimean War when a pipe major with the rd Sutherland Highlanders heard a Sardinian band playing what was a refrain from Rossinirsquos William Tell. He adapted it for the pipes.Many years later Andy Stewart, never seen without a kilt, would put the words to what became A Scottish Soldier. The song, recorded at Abbey Road, was one of two US chart entries by Stewart , reached number one in Canada, spent  weeks in the UK singles chart and over a year in the US chart. It was also huge in countries with a Scottish expatriate population, like Australia and New Zealand.This weekrsquos Piping Live! events have the National Piping Centre as their hub. In Edinburgh, therersquos a Fringe event tonight at St Ceciliarsquos Hall with The Piobaireachd Society putting on a concert of classical pipe music.Tomorrow at the Glasgow centre itrsquos the solo piping competition and at lunchtime, and throughout the week, bands will be on the steps of the Royal Concert Hall, Fiveways at TGI Fridays and at St Enoch Square. Therersquos also heat on of Pipe Idol, the under- solo competition.All the grade on bands will compete twice each day, performing three traditional types of tune ndash a march, a Strathspey and a reel ndash and a medley. The bands have to perform in a circle, facing inwards, assessed by four judges, two piping, one for drummers and a fourth for overall performance. Therersquos also a drum major competition, the massed march past The Worldsrsquo Chieftain, culminating in every piper on the Green thousands playing in unison, a sound which should certainly reach the parts of Glasgow that the previous week has not touched.For a full breakdown of whatrsquos on go to www.pipinglive"},{"url":null,"title":"ellon guides turn back the clock at open event","story":"Girlguiding Ellon District have celebrated the th birthday of their meeting place.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, licensed sellers from Orkney will have a chance to develop the market for their product and people can try goose for themselves, on Orkney, and across Scotland.“Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

The charitable trust leading The Quaich Project has also revealed that live sporting events could also be staged there. Other ideas published on its website include hosting spectacular light shows like The Enchanted Forest in Pitlochry, the staging of “Shakespeare in the Gardens” productions, like those at the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, and even a “Bark in the Park” event for dog-lovers.The Ross Development Trust, which was set up by hotel developer Norman Springford to pursue The Quaich Project, has revealed some of its ambitions ahead of an official planning application next year. The new “world-class” arena would replace an existing concrete bowl, which is currently host a series of Summer Sessions concerts by acts including Lewis Capaldi, Florence and the Machine, Primal Scream and Madness.A global design competition was won two years ago by an American-led consortium after the city council agreed to work with Springford, who has pledged £ million of his own money to try to breathe new le into the gardens as an events arena.Tattoo producer and chief executive Brigadier David Allfrey said: “There is a real opportunity to showcase this extraordinary valley in the middle of Edinburgh with all its history and to make it accessible and very exciting as a cultural and recreational space.“I’m really excited about the project. Shouldn’t we\u2028be streaming the fireworks and the pageantry from the castle straight into the gardens  And perhaps giving small concerts during the daytime or in the evenings and at other times of the year ”Writing on The Quaich Project’s website, managing director David Ellis said it was an opportunity for the gardens to become “a world leader in free to access, public, green spaces.”He added: “I’d love to see some form of live sportappropriate in terms of size and scale or screenings of major sporting events in the gardens.

And the Scottish Government should also \u2028be ready to deal with rows with Westminster in certain areas of international affairs in order to “promote Scotland’s interests,” in the post-Brexit landscape, experts have told a Holyrood committee.Priorities such as tackling climate change, driving down emissions, defending a democratic and secure Europe and promoting inclusive growth are among the areas which could be at the heart of future of Scottish-EU relations.Anthony Salamone of the Scottish Centre on European Relations says Scotland should develop a “comprehensive modern European strategy” in a submission to Holyrood’s External Relations committee which is conducting an inquiry into the issue.“In the present political context, the Scottish Government’s European and external affairs policies are markedly dferent from those of the UK Government,” he states.“It is also undeniable that Scotland possesses a distinct identity recognised in Europe and globally. “The Scottish Government will have to navigate current and future disagreements with the UK government on EU and foreign policy, determining the best means of promoting Scotland’s interests.”His colleague, Dr Kirsty Hughes, warns that when the UK finally leaves the EU, this will diminish its influence on the “global stage” and hit Scotland.But she added: “There is still room for Scotland to outline its own European priorities.”EvenBrexit goes ahead, the EU’s policies in areas like climate change, single market regulation and human rights among other areas, will all remain of “central importance” to Scotland, she adds.“But influencing the EU and wider European context should remain central to Scotland whether from inside or outside the EU – and that means working with partnersat all levels.”A European strategy for Scotland would set out clear priority areas which could include climate change, cooperating to create a “democratic and secure” Europe, a more open migration policy and pushing for fair growth, according to Hughes.“Engaging with those wider issues more comprehensively through building a European strategy for Scotland, and placing it at the heart of a wider international strategy, can open out our horizons again and give more weight to all the ways Scottish actors – government, political, business, civil society,cultural and more – continue to engage in Europe and the world.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots guards now the most undermanned regiment in the uk figures reveal","story":"The Scots Guards, who have fought in nearly every conflict since the reign of Charles I, are now the most undermanned regiment in the UK, according to figures obtained under freedom of information law.

Is it not time you got over it Alas, Ms Sturgeon#sEU policy is vacuous, unsustainable humbug. If Britain stays in the EU, Scotland will automatically leave on Independence Day, creating an immediate “hard border” with the UK . EU tarfs will apply and trade negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster. Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland. The Smith Commission Reportsubsequently made the following recommendation: #Crown Estate#. Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland. The ‘Barbour’ brand is the ultimate symbol of being proud to be British worn by celebrities around the world, including our own British Royal Family, and made in South Shields in North East England. Although Nicola’s grandmother did come from Sunderland, so it might have been an unconscious calling from her ancestors. ‘Second Working Man– “Leebralism is – feth I can hardly richtly tell dee what hit is!’“What is Leebralism” A Liberal candidate made it clear on a visit to Shetland.It is being in favour of the freedom of business and the freedom of the inidual, even though these may conflict.The man was standing for the European Parliament back when John Major was PM. He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle. Something to do with their backing from small businesses.Of course they changed their minds once it was clear it was going to happen.A bit like Tavish backing the right of women to join the Royal and Ancient golf club at St. Andrews, after they’d let them in.So the clash between securing the freedom of iniduals and that of business is resolved by sitting on a fence and waiting for a strong wind.What is Liberalism Whose round is it Another classic cock-up from the SNP!

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port.

annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"shock at sudden passing of reds legend breslin","story":"THE local football community was plunged into mourning last night at the sudden passing of Cltonville legend Tommy Breslin at the age of .The former Reds player and manager died while on a family holiday in Spain.Breslin famously guided Cltonville to back-to-back Irish League titles in  and  and won eight trophies in a hugely successful four-year spell at Solitude.In the summer of , he was at the helm when Cltonville took on Celtic over two legs in an historic Champions League Qualier.He ed to the club on an interim basis following the departure of his successor Gerard Lyttle at the end of the  campaign while he was also a revered midfielder in his playing days at the club.Social media was awash with tributes last night as fans and rival supporters alike paid tribute to one of the game’s most affable and popular figures.Having updated their social media feeds to include a picture of their iconic former boss, Cltonville posted a statement which read: “Cltonville Football Club are devastated to this evening learn of the sudden and untimely death of Tommy Breslin.“While the club will naturally pay a fuller tribute to Tommy very soon, at the moment in time our thoughts are very much with the Breslin family circle and all of his many friends, to whom we extend our deepest sympathy.”Lyttle, who was also part of Breslin’s backroom team before taking over the Cltonville hotseat, tweeted: “Shocked and saddened to hear – one of the nicest men I’ve ever known.

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine. It will be a real celebration.”An Evening with Joby Fox takes place on Friday August  in Cultúrlann.

Old and young took part, with some former ship builders aged in their s joining members of the current workforce in the lines.The gathering of the generations of workers came as administrators continue to explore a number of potential bids for the company.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Handprints were left by former shipyard workers in wet cement BDO Northern Ireland has agreed to a “temporary” unpaid lay-off of the workforce until Friday to enable those commercial opportunities to be explored.While the workers are no longer getting paid, the move means their contracts of employment remain unbroken.Ex-foreman Samuel Tumelty, who worked for the shipyard for  years, was helped from his wheelchair to place his palm in the concrete.“It would be hard to seeit does go, my heart is still in this company,” he said.“I hope it can be saved. The men need their livelihoods and to throw them out in the street is unbelievable. The amount of ships they built and the quality of the ships, they were top notch.

She said some of the potential offers for the company were “credible”.“We have had an incredible day where hundreds of auld hands and their families have turned out to have their hands cast in concrete to show the role they have played and more fundamentally the role they are playing to preserve this yard into the future,” she said.“They have turned out today to show full support and solidarity for the workers who have taken a stand to defend jobs and defend the shipyard.“We are hopeful of getting a resolution here that does save the jobs, that does save the yard.“There’s a lot going on every day, virtually around the clock, there is work being done to try to create a situation where we can be victorious and save the jobs and the future of the shipyard.“So long as we stand here and we declare that we are willing to fight and defend this place to the end, there’s hope.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland ambulance shortage has not impacted critical callouts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on. I found that the Fijians are quite similar to Irish people because home and family are close to them, but they take it to the next level by inviting everyone it and checking how people are.”Anyone wishing to volunteer for Think Pacic must be between the ages of -.

To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"welshpool hand cyclist raises","story":"Andrew Paddison from Welshpool and his Lands End to John OGroats hand bike chaltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtrity ride..Picture bltspan classtruncate-full-screengty Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Welshpool hand-cyclist raises over K for charityAndrew Paddison in training for his Land’s End to John O’Groats hand bike chltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtarity ride.

That total and then some was passed in no time and has now risen above the pound, mark which has delighted Jeff.ldquoMany thanks to all the sponsors, supporters, players, umpires and scorers, Jeff enthused.ldquoThanks also to Liz Byrne, Jackie Wilson and Dave Crudgington who ran the refreshments and food made by chef Ryan Finnegan. We just couldnrsquot have achieved our target without the help of a lot of people and I can never thank them enough, he added.Sunday was an emotional day for Jeff and he was at times reduced to the odd wee tear.ldquoRodney Hassardrsquos tribute had me close to breaking down, but I was able to hold it together. I got my wish of playing alongside a lot of my former team-mates and I am indebted to them all for turning up and sharing the occasion with me.In the first challenge game of the day Dundrumrsquos current first team took on a squad of former Dundrum players that included Alan Mills and Darren Oldroyd, from Drumaness, Mark Yeates, from Downpatrick, and Byron Woodruff, from Saintfield.The game was competitive to say the least and thanks to decent knocks from Terry Hutley , Stuart Campbelland Sean CameronDundrum posted .Yeates sent the stumps cartwheeling on two occasions with Oldroyd also picking up two wickets. Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for . McNerlin, Keba Butler, Neil Reilly and Peter Calvert all got one wicket apiece.Dundrum got a steady start from Greg Hutleyand Rodney Hassard before Drumanessrsquo Neil Gelston removed them both. Oldroyd then hit the middle stump with successive deliveries leaving Dundrum on  for .McNerlin hit Gelston straight over the scoreboard in his  before Stuart Campbellwas run out by Woodruff. Saintfieldrsquos T McCavera picked up two wickets with CIYMSrsquo Steven Hughes and Woodruff also getting in on the act.The last wicket partnership of  between Neil Reillyand Keba Butlergot Dundrum closer than it looked as the NCU side ran out comfortable winners.The match ball sponsors were Bao and Bento and Pizza Palazzo, Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Downpatrick railway’s first afternoon tea event is runaway success  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and Co Down Railway got out the best china when it hosted its very first afternoon tea event recently.The experience started with guests boarding the train at Downpatrick town station and taking a relaxing journey, travelling in a comfortable s carriage, to Inch Abbey by steam train.They then boarded the buffet carriage where guests were welcomed by the volunteers with a glass of prosecco, wine or a soft drink, before being directed to their allocated tables to enjoy a mouthwatering selection of freshly handmade sandwiches, luxury homemade scones with jam and cream and mini French patisseries.Guests were also offered bottomless teas and coffees, or their own pot of luxury specialist tea.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner, who was one of the servers, said: ldquoThis is something wersquove wanted to do for some time, and itrsquos always been a very popular treat on heritage railways in Great Britain.ldquoNerves may have been a bit jangled as with all first events.

If something does not happen soon we are finished, he said.ldquoTo be owed something like pound, by a public body like the Housing Executive is scandalous and someone should step in to sort this mess out.The crisis has been sparked off by staff shortages and industrial action in the accounts department of the Executive.A spokesman for the Executive said they were extremely concerned at the situation and had brought it to the attention of the Government.ldquoThere have been a number of vacancies in the department and we are unable to fill them because of the Government ban on recruitment to the public service. The result is that we cannot porocess these settlements as quickly as we normally do.He added: We are trying to do all we can to help the smaller contractors who are always much more vulnerable in such a situation.NEWCASTLE mdash A verdict of accidental death has been ed on Newcastle motorcycle ace Tom Herron, who died at the North West  earlier this year.Thirty year-old Herron, ranked third in the world, came off his bike at mph and smashed into a lamp post just  yards from the finishing line in the cc race. He died in hospital two hours later.The inquest at Coleraine heard how Herron had ridden in the race with an injury to his thumb and arm, but the pathologistrsquos report could not determine whether this would have interfered with his ability to control the bike at high speed.Two police constables, who witnessed the accident, told the inquest that the bike scraped the ground and the rider then lost control.The coroner, Mr Robin Wray, discounted suggestions to close the Portrush circuit and said that the racing gave a great deal of pleasure to a lot of people. He added that he had seen Herron race many times and always had a great admiration for him.DRUMANESS mdash Fresh hope for the old Drumaness Mill, which was becoming something of a white elephant, emerged this week with the news that Irish Waste Services have long term plans to develop it into an industrial estate.This week a spokesman for the company confirmed they had already moved on to the site. The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
