It is lobbying the Government to introduce a one-off stamp duty-free move to encourage older homeowners to downsize in retirement.The premise is that slashing moving costs for pensioners will help free up larger homes for those further down the ladder and thus stimulate the housing market. It would also release capital to see them through retirement (and possibly slip a few thousand to desperate children and grandchildren struggling to get on the housing ladder).         Pilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. ‘We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,’ says Jackie         The couple sold their home in Surrey, pictured, for £365,000 and moved to HampshireCertainly, there is support for the idea. After all, when adult children have flown the nest, many retirees are left rattling around houses with far more rooms than they need. Plus, larger homes and gardens become more tiresome to manage in older age.Yet, curiously, upsizing is a fast-growing trend. A recent report found that 46 per cent of homeowners aged 55 to 74 had spent extra money on their latest move. And 28 per cent of those had bought a bigger property with more bedrooms, despite many people in this age group living either alone or as a couple, found the study by the Cambridge Centre for Housing \u0026amp Planning Research and the National House Building Council (NHBC) .Dr Elle Boag, a senior lecturer in social psychology at Birmingham City University, says upsizing in later life can have a magical effect on both inidual wellbeing and harmony within a marriage.‘For many over-50s, this will be the first time in their lives that they’ve had the opportunity to buy the home they really want now their kids have grown up and they have more disposable income,’ she explains.‘My husband and I downsized from a large five-bed to a three-bed when the children left home, but I’m now upsizing again because I miss the space and luxuries such as en-suite bathrooms, a study each for my husband and me, a downstairs loo and the option to use a bedroom as a yoga room if I want to.’She adds: ‘By the time they hit 50, many people start to question: “Who am I saving all this money for?” If your children are self-sufficient and you want to buy a bigger house, why shouldn’t you? If you can afford to do it, upsizing is good for you, while downsizing can have a very negative impact on a relationship.‘If you’ve been in a large house and you decide to downsize once the children have left home then, suddenly, you’re going to be living in much closer proximity to your partner or spouse again, which can ruin relationships.’Debi Ireland agrees. Not that her children have expressed resentment. ‘We’ve served our time in much smaller properties during our respective marriages and latterly together for four years in Surrey, and have always put our children first,’ she reflects. ‘We were desperate to get away from the traffic and noise down there and move back up north, where we’re both from, to a period cottage or barn with glorious views and oceans of space indoors and out.‘We decided that as soon as David retired in 2017, we’d make the dream happen.’Having sold the mortgage-free house in Surrey for £660,000, they each added savings to top up the pot and paid cash for their barn.‘When David first showed me the brochure, I was worried the barn looked too isolated, mindful that, in older age, we need to be close to amenities and a community,’ says Debi. ‘But before the estate agent arrived to meet us, I’d peered through the windows and fallen in love with it.’Small wonder, given that it has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, a spacious living room with brick inglenook fireplace, a large farmhouse kitchen, a family room and even a studio for Debi’s photography. A farmer has promised to clear the lane of snow in the winter in return for his sheep grazing on four acres of Debi and David’s land. They pay a local man with a sit-on mower to tackle the other acre.‘A few of my friends questioned whether upsizing was right at our age. But we’ve worked hard all our lives, raised our children and now it’s time for us,’ says Debi.‘We both help our kids out as much as we can, because we recognise that it’s difficult for the younger generation to get on the housing ladder these days. We want them to have the best lives they can — but we also want the same for ourselves.’It’s a similar tale for Pilates teacher Jackie Brealey, 60, and her husband Mick, 61, a motorcycle instructor. ‘We put up with our old two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with a tiny garden for ten years, but craved space both indoors and outdoors for living and entertaining,’ says Jackie.She and Mick have four children between them, aged 42, 38, 30 and 25, plus four grandchildren and another on the way. Three of the children own property, though none as big as their parents’ home.Three years ago, the couple cashed in by selling their pricey, but tiny, mortgage-free property in Surrey for £365,000 and went house-hunting in Hampshire to get more for their money. Their lives and relationship have improved exponentially as a result.‘We fell in love with a detached Sixties house with spacious rooms, three large bedrooms, big windows and half an acre of garden and paid £440,000 for it, using savings and a chunk of my pension to remain mortgage-free,’ says Jackie.‘Almost immediately, we added a large extension costing £50,000 on the back of it, to create an open-plan living space.’And they don’t feel they have anything to apologise for: ‘All our money is in the property now and, one way or another, it will all end up going to the kids, so it’s hardly as if we’ve blown their inheritance by upsizing.‘We helped out one of the children with a deposit for a home and help all of them financially in other ways. We don’t feel guilty at all about upsizing now. The property is an investment for the future.‘Upsizing was a lifestyle choice for us. We love entertaining, but, if we invited even two friends over for dinner at our old house, it was a squeeze. Now, we throw parties all year round and have discovered that we both love gardening.‘Inside, even the third bedroom is so huge that it doubles as a Pilates studio if I teach from home, and we’ve earmarked it for conversion to a “granny annexe” if ever our elderly parents need to live with us.‘Friends and family were dubious about us upsizing and asked us: “What the hell are you going to do with that huge garden?” But we love it. We’re not overlooked here, and Mick and I often sit in the garden with a cup of tea in the evenings and watch bats and shooting stars.’Had it not been for them upsizing to a spacious four-bedroom home near Faversham, Kent, in October 2015, charity directors Margaret Lee-Roberts, 69, and her husband Trevor, 75, a retired project manager, wouldn’t know the joy of having three of their six grandchildren to sleep over every Thursday.They previously lived in a tiny three-bedroom home on the first and second floor above a ground-floor business premises.‘We raised our family in a large, four-bedroom Victorian house, but then downsized to our last home when we suddenly needed to live closer to my late father when he became ill. In hindsight, we bought in haste,’ says Margaret.         Had it not been for them upsizing to a spacious four-bedroom home near Faversham, Kent, in October 2015, charity directors Margaret Lee-Roberts, 69, and her husband Trevor, 75, a retired project manager, wouldn’t know the joy of having three of their six grandchildren to sleep over every Thursday         The couple had previously lived on the top floor of this building She and Trevor have three children, aged 45, 42 and 33. ‘At £280,000, it was a bargain and, of course, it was a bonus to free up a bit of cash, but we didn’t appreciate how cramped we’d feel — and how much that would get to us.‘We had one daughter, her partner and a newborn living with us at the time, so the lack of space was impossible for all of us.‘We longed for something more spacious and useable.’They sold the property in late 2014 and upsized to their current home — a new-build four-bedroom house costing £340,000.Although classed as an end terrace, it was substantially larger than their old home, with four large double bedrooms, two bathrooms, an open-plan kitchen-diner and a large living room.Margaret says: ‘We’ve got masses of storage and a small garden, which is fine as we’re not keen gardeners anyway. It’s absolute bliss to have so much space after all those years feeling cooped up.‘We even have one room full of toys for when our daughter’s three children come to stay on a Thursday while she works late as a psychology teacher.‘There’s a bus stop and a supermarket close by, so we can catch the bus into Canterbury if ever we reach the stage when we can’t drive.’She adds: ‘Pensioners are entitled to live as they choose, especially when they’ve worked hard to own their properties. Many, like us, have lots of visitors to stay. My generation don’t live very differently from younger generations.‘Why shouldn’t you enjoy space at home at our age if you can afford it? We tried downsizing and it didn’t work for us.‘This is our forever home — and we’re never leaving.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Booze parties holidays Brussels spends cash","story":"Share this article The UK pays around £9billion to the EU each year and the bloc is demanding £39billion as part of the Brexit orce bill agreed by Theresa May – even if there is No Deal.

(The exception, in which she looks straight at the camera as if suddenly alert to its presence, appears like an almost accusatory jolt in the middle of the sequence.) There is no accompanying text, but the portraits speak quietly and heartbreakingly of intimate but universal subjects: unconditional love, familial duty and tenderness, the slow, inexorable passing of time, the silence that falls on and around the very old.“My mother was 88 when I started the series and she is 90 now,” says Graham, who is 63. “I suppose I wanted to somehow create an extended portrait of her in old age, a clear-eyed look at her and her last years on Earth. For myself, but also for my family. I have a young son now, and with that came the realisation of what it really means to look after a child. Plus, you find yourself reflecting on your own memories of being looked after as a child. It’s the continuity of a line.”What, though, prompted him to make a book of the images, to put them out in the world rather than keep them in the family? “It wasn’t a difficult decision to make,” he says. “I asked my mum, of course, and she agreed, though to be honest, she would bless anything I do. And I trusted in my instinct. There is nothing embarrassing or undignified in the portraits. There are no fancy camera angles. I kept everything constant: the same chair, the same daylight through the window. The only things that change are her cardigans and tops. For me, it was a very conscious and contemplative process.”The end result bears that out. Mother is, one one level, an exploration of old age as a kind of hinterland, a suspended state in which the world shrinks to the size of a room and consciousness fragments. Throughout, Graham’s patient, painterly approach demands and repays attentiveness, and one’s eye is drawn inevitably to small details: how the camera’s focus shifts almost imperceptibly from portrait to portrait, highlighting the lines on his mother’s face or the silvery grey of her hair.There is nothing obtrusive, just light falling gently on a sleeping face and on the soft pinks and violets of a floral blouse. I have long been fascinated by the idea of quiet photographs, but here the silence is almost Beckettian. “I would sit there for hours,” says Graham, “listening to the ticking of the clock, the wind blowing outside, very aware of time passing. I knew I had to find some way of conveying the stretching and unravelling of time as I experienced it in that room.”Graham has always been an artist concerned with the otherness of the everyday. This may, in part, be a reaction to his teenage years, which were spent amid the precisely ordered conformity of Harlow new town in Essex. An entirely self-taught photographer, his early books, such as A1 – the Great North Road (1983) and Beyond Caring (1986), gave the impression that he belonged to a still unfolding tradition of British social documentary as practised by the likes of Chris Killip and Graham Smith. The first clue that this was not the case came with 1994’s Ceasefire, a photo-book about Northern Ireland published the same year as the IRA’s actual ceasefire. It comprised images of the sky over Ballymurphy, the Bogside and various other neighbourhoods associated with the Troubles.American Night followed in 2003, some of its photographs printed to look almost opaque, a visual metaphor, he said at the time, for the disorientation he felt when working in the dazzling sunlight of the American south. Since then, the critically acclaimed and multi-volumed book, A Shimmer of Possibility (2007), and 2014’s Does Yellow Run Forever? – images of rainbows in the west of Ireland, his partner sleeping, and American gold stores – have continued Graham’s singular exploration of what he calls “elusive and nebulous subject matter”.In 2001, he told me: “The photography I most respect pulls something out of the ether of nothingness.” With Mother, he set himself a similar but different challenge: to evoke his mother’s presence when that presence was becoming ever more elusive. Encroaching mortality may be the subtext, but the tenderness of Graham’s gaze betokens something else: the weight of love and loss conveyed through the act of deep looking. Mother is, unavoidably, an elegiac book, but also a quietly accepting, even affirmative one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48ce4e47d7c5250256b33af03341edd2ce8bbd7/65_568_1094_656/master/1094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d874bfc9560475406b88e7e9ade56d7b","title":"down with god how the soviet union took on religion in pictures","story":"Marx said religion was the opium of the people – and in the Soviet Union, atheism became government policy, enforced by the state and encouraged by anti-religious posters and magazines.

As temperatures continue to rise, smaller rural communities are becoming unsustainable, while the logistics of feeding and watering the growing city population has come to dominate the economic agenda. Steven is a PR spokesman for the corporation in charge of supplying an unnamed city with potable water. Previous attempts to augment the overstretched supply – an overground pipeline, an armoured freight train – have become the focus of terrorist activity, with raiding parties from the countryside violently advancing the demands of those who live beyond the urban centres. A new plan is hatched: an iceberg is to be towed from the Arctic and brought to an “ice dock” where its abundance of pure drinking water can be tapped and distributed. It is hoped that the iceberg will be largely immune from attacks by vigilantes and climate protestors. Moreover, meltwater from the berg – stillicide – can be utilised to irrigate agricultural land throughout the duration of its passage.The plan is controversial. Construction of the gigantic ice dock will necessitate bulldozing hundreds of homes, destroying established neighbourhoods and communities in the process. Meanwhile, unbeknown to the planners, a scientific discovery relating to the ecosystems in the path of the berg may bring the development of the dock to a standstill.The genesis of Stillicide was unusual. In an afterword, Jones explains how the idea for the book had been growing, though it was a commission from Radio 4 that finally brought the project to life. He was challenged to create a sequence of 12 short stories, each requiring exactly 15 minutes of air time, with the series to be broadcast in its entirety before print publication. “Being for radio,” he writes, “with listeners not having the chance to turn back a page, the world and its characters had to have an immediacy and be clear on first hearing.”Jones is famous for the economy of his texts – his short story “The Edge of the Shoal”, which won the BBC national short story award in 2017, was actually a ruthlessly abridged version of his short novel Cove – and it’s clear from the results that the strict parameters of the brief have acted more as stimulus than restriction. Reading Stillicide before listening to the audio version, I was surprised by how different the two experiences turned out to be. In its written form, Stillicide has a terse, minimalist quality that is at least partly down to how the text is presented on the page. Short paragraphs and generous line spacing encouraged me to read the novel as a series of prose poems. The radical distillation of language, the sense that every word has been inidually chosen, results in a blunt perfection that heightens this effect. Narrative exists, but it is secondary to form. On first encounter at least, the pleasures Stillicide offers appear to be more aesthetic than dramatic.Meanwhile, the men charged with towing the iceberg – “the calf” – are likened to whale-hunters, hard-handed heroes, yet the diminishing boundaries of their reality are brought shockingly home to us when we learn that the crew of this latter-day Pequod have never tasted fish. As Jones details the care the mariners lavish on their deteriorating hardware, we read his words as a warning of new mass extinctions:The pieces lay like artefacts, the crew’s care of them akin to the careful homage of archaeologists. They scraped away corrosion and the salt, with affection close to love.Treated the motors as things that were amongst the last of their kind.While mouthing corporate platitudes by day, executive Steven spends his evenings watching DVDs of old nature programmes, a tension he sees reflected in the ominous tap-tapping of a chaffinch’s beak against his office window, a troublesome, repetitive sound that threatens to disrupt an important press conference. The journalist pushing hardest for answers is Colin, who we learn is the husband of Ruth, the nurse who has been caring for Branner’s sick wife. “Colin must be hard to live with,” Steven observes, but as Ruth wonders if she is ready to abandon her marriage for still greater uncertainty, we are pressed in turn to ask ourselves if being hard to live with is the price that must be paid for asking difficult questions. The dense web of connections between characters and stories leaves no doubt that Stillicide is best described as a novel rather than a collection of shorter fictions. That these connections can be quantified not only in terms of character relationships but as a cumulative statement of theme lends further weight to this argument.In his book-length essay on literature and climate change The Great Derangement, the novelist Amitav Ghosh argues that for mainstream literary writers, the subject and details of climate catastrophe still appear too vast and too improbable to be used as subject matter by novelists accustomed to dealing with everyday reality. The result, he suggests, is that this most urgent of contemporary subject matter is being exiled to the borderlands of genre fiction, while literary fiction is in danger of becoming irrelevant. Unsurprisingly, he has been criticised for so summarily dismissing science fiction as an unworthy or less significant vehicle for the description, discussion and analysis of important subjects. The climate has been a central concern in sci-fi for more than five decades. Taking Ghosh’s argument on its own terms, though, I am sure he would agree that the tide is beginning to turn. If climate chaos was previously too big a subject for “serious” writers to wrestle with, it is now too big to ignore. Any writer who does not seek to address it in some way runs the risk of joining the dinosaurs in their oblivion.With recent novels from Megan Hunter, Jenni Fagan, Richard Powers, Ben Smith, John Lanchester and Ghosh himself working hard to imagine the effects of climate crisis at both the global and the personal level, Stillicide can be added to the growing roster of powerful and urgent meditations on the future. As a tract of written language, it is close to perfect. As a repository for ideas, it is imaginative and far reaching. As a story of and for our times, it is very human, and deadly serious.• Nina Allan’s The Dollmaker is published by Riverrun. Stillicide is published by Granta (£12).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.We begin with a “surprise” for CCCubbon, who has become “quite addicted” to The House on the Strand by Daphne du Maurier:At first I was scoffing mentally at the notion that a drug could induce time travel to the 14th century but the story has drawn me in and I find myself addicted to the addiction of Richard who cannot resist returning again and again, getting irritated by his wife’s presence, caught between two worlds. It is noteworthy the way du Maurier tells of how the landscape changes over the centuries, how Richard searches to marry up the places of then and his time – and yes, there is a map.“Just finished Leonard and Hungry Paul by Ronan Hession,” says pinstripedflower, and “loved it”:It’s a rather gentle tale of two friends who haven’t quite fully embraced life, and how they get on without being ‘complete’. I have to say I probably most resonated with Hungry Paul’s takedown of his sister Grace on her need for ‘busyness’ and it made me think about my always being rushing around! Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice, uncomplicated but well-written novel.Kerr was a wonderful writer. She had such a clear voice when she wrote! The artist’s eye is there and she doesn’t lose the perspective of the young girl even as she writes as an older, more mature, more experienced woman.Tim O’Brien’s magnificent The Things They Carried has worked its dark magic on Larts:I thought it was frightening, awesome, touching, shocking. It’s a well-written book - is it fiction? Memoir? Well he keeps telling you that it’s often made up but then tells you that it’s true. None of that bothered me particularly. The whole thing struck me as authentic and honest. Wonderful, if difficult, read.Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez has been convincing for daveportivo:I thought it was a fascinating read and a powerful argument for collecting sex-disaggregated data. I knew much of it already, but the medical research chapter was particularly disturbing. I’d read about the effects of the “average human” in terms of pollution before (there are some tragic stories), but hadn’t really considered the implications of that concept (or a lack of rigorous, multi-phase testing on women) in terms of basic medicine and diagnosis ... But in many ways that proves her point, even when I was aware of a problem in the way we measured something, I didn’t think: “Hang on, I wonder if they are doing this in other areas”.JayZed has been making good progress through Proust’s In Search of Lost Time:I finished In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower last week (Penguin translation by James Grieve). I mentioned before that there were parts of Swann’s Way that I found a bit of a slog (and other parts that I loved). About half-way through volume two, however - on the way to Balbec - I suddenly got it. I understand now why people become immersed in and obsessed with Proust, and I’m looking forward to the rest of it.“James Meek’s To Calais, In Ordinary Time is easily my new novel of 2019,” writes allworthy:A group of archers are making for Calais when the Plague hits. It’s 1348. The novel is written in three styles or registers from people of different stations. It’s not quite as wide as The Canterbury Tales but you get a good mix and Meek deftly inserts strong women into the story. It’s real achievement is the language. The book is easy to read but contains many words, phrases and cadences which feel right for the period and which gives the book great energy and a realism. The characters are complex, even the minor ones. They are often wrestling with an upside down world that they struggle to understand. It’s not all doom and gloom either. Some of it is very funny but a moving, well-paced novel that never slacks. Really recommended.Finally, interwar has been reading The Red House Mystery by AA Milne:A thoroughly silly plot, characters all sound the same (except the comically rendered servants), dead guy lying there and everyone standing around coolly discussing the pros and cons of whether their country-house host did it. Yes, it’s just what the doctor ordered (or should have)!

The Group Areas Act dictated that people of different races lived in separate areas, with black people forced to live in townships far from the centre of cities. Public spaces such as parks and beaches were segregated, and there were white-only schools and hospitals. The government restricted the type of jobs black people could do and controlled their movement.Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress party came to power in 1994, ushering in a new era for the country.A quarter of a century on, how has life changed for those living in its cities?We want to hear your views about how life in South African cities has changed in the last 25 years.

By 6am the surfers have arrived, followed by the runners and their dogs, then executives-cum-cyclists, speed walkers and yoga instructors. By 7am the cafes are open for breakfast and children, on holiday from inland schools, are already in the water.Where fellow oceanside metropolis Cape Town has marketed itself to the world, Durban has positioned itself as South Africa’s playground. Beachfront theme parks and twirling public waterslides attract families from around the country, and all walks of life. This accessibility and affordability have made this eight-kilometre strip arguably one of South Africa’s most inclusive public spaces.Beyond the narrow strip of beach and promenade, though, South Africa’s third largest city struggles with the same problems as the rest of the country: 25 years after the fall of apartheid the city which was ided by race remains ided by economics.But it is setting out to address those issues with several new models of growth – the waterfront, a privately funded development of restaurants and retail along Florida Road, and the redesign of the traditional market at Warwick Triangle.Each embodies a different theory of how Durban can best become a more inclusive city – and each has its defenders and detractors.“Clearly the beach in Durban was seen as the playground for white South Africans,” says former city manager Michael Sutcliffe. As a member of the United Democratic Front, Sutcliffe led protests to integrate Durban’s beaches in the late 1980s.Twenty-five years after the fall of the brutal apartheid regime, South Africa\u0027s cities remain hugely ided, both economically and racially. This week  Cities explores the incredible changes taking place, the challenges faced and the projects that bring hope.\u0026nbspAfrica correspondent Jason Burke reports from the Flats, where violence and death are endemic just miles from Cape Town\u0027s spectacular beaches and trendy cafes.Author\u0026nbspNiq Mhlongo pens a love letter to the other Soweto, one that visitors to gentrified Vilakazi Street never see.\u0026nbspWe hear from Port Elizabeth, where one architect is using recycled materials to transform his city, and Durban, where a surf school is changing the lives of vulnerable children.\u0026nbspWe explore the deadly underground world of\u0026nbspzama zama\u0026nbspgold miners operating illegally under the city of Johannesburg, visit the Afrikaner-only town of Orania and publish an extraordinary photo essay\u0026nbspby Magnum nominee Lindokuhle Sobekwa, who documents life in a formerly white-dominated area where his mother once worked as a domestic helper.But when the end of apartheid saw white flight from the city centre to the northern suburbs, the beach fell on hard times. Prime real estate overlooking the port was abandoned and illegally occupied, the city’s pastel-coloured art-deco buildings became derelict as landlords neglected them and bylaws were trampled on. The beach, particularly popular South Beach, became a crime hotspot and few dared to be caught there before sunrise or after dark.The real turnaround came in the run-up to the 2010 World Cup, when as a host city Durban had to rethink its image. Along with the repaved promenade and formalised flea markets, came the Moses Mabhida stadium, within walking distance of the beachfront.Durban officials were accused of exacerbating inequality by prioritising entertainment over basic necessities like running water and safe housing in the townships miles away from the tourist hotspots. Still, despite being briefly embroiled in a spending scandal and with a “Mike-is-right” style of leadership that antagonised some fellow councillors, Sutcliffe is credited with revitalising the promenade.Except for one sign that eluded post-apartheid painters, Durban’s beachfront now resembles an idyllic melting pot of South African cultures. On Christmas Day and New Year’s Day, in particular, the beach is so crowded with people who a generation ago were not allowed on the sand that it could be read as an annual defiance to the country’s old laws.The project is still ongoing. A decade ago, the Point Road area near Durban’s docks was known for derelict buildings and illegal prostitution. Now, artists impressions of what the area could look like in the next 10 years imagine glistening skyscrapers reflecting the Indian Ocean, alongside a mixed development of luxury apartments, retail, business zones and tourist hotspots.The development will link the promenade to the port, extending the Golden Mile into a project that hopes to rival Cape Town’s V\u0026ampA Waterfront. A joint venture between the eThekwini Municipality and Malaysian developers UEM Sunrise, the project is reported to cost R35bn (£1.8bn) and will be overseen by the national government, in part to avoid corruption scandals that have overshadowed Durban.As a model for inclusivity, it has one major downside: the beaches along the northern suburbs are now an enclave for middle class and wealthier Durbanites, particularly moneyed black tourists who prefer the warmer Indian Ocean to Cape Town’s icy Atlantic. What’s more, despite its plans for mixed-income development, the new Point Road project looks likely to exclude the largely black, working class communities who have kept Durban’s city centre alive.A second approach is taking place at what is arguably Durban’s most successful regeneration project, Florida Road, a trendy thoroughfare just over a mile from the beachfront. A project by London-based developer Urban Lime hopes tourists and especially locals will linger in the courtyards that mix the Victorian and Edwardian facades of this historic neighbourhood with trendy boutiques and restaurants of the so-called new South Africa.Previously a street of churches, retirement homes and an unassuming supermarket, the Florida Road turnaround began when Urban Lime bought a parking lot, and transformed it into a retail and outdoor entertainment space. Unusual in a city traumatised by crime, the strip is designed to encourage walking, and by day a row of dessert spots welcome a family-conscious community, many of them devout Muslims. It offers mixed price options: a taco spot and Afro’s Chicken Shop, a local favourite, are affordable easy dining, with more fine-dining restaurants further along the street.The developer works with local residents’ associations to employ a private security company that patrols the privately owned public spaces, and Urban Lime has expanded aggressively, accumulating around 200,000 sq m of retail space since 2014 and spending R1.2bn.Recognising the inner-city’s cash-driven economy, Urban Lime has moved into the city centre, where it has subided retail space to allow small traders to rent for as little as R1,500 a month for several square metres. They’ve taken over the iconic Durban Club Chambers, a downtown high-rise that houses the city’s legal fraternity and was once the offices of one of the country’s first black lawyers and founding member of the ANC Pixley ka Isaka Seme. They plan to turn part of the block into a pedestrian zone in an attempt to coax the advocates who work in the city to spend more time in central Durban.The company’s managing director, Nad Shahid, explains a grand plan of 16 nodes that will reconnect the suburbs to the inner-city and eventually back to the beach. Centred on a refurbished building or district, these nodes revitalise the area block by block with small to medium-sized retail, restaurants and office space, bringing traffic back to abandoned spaces and helping Durban combine the commercial drive of Johannesburg with the oceanside lifestyle of Cape Town.“It has potential to be a huge business city and it also has the potential to be a huge lifestyle-stroke-tourist city as well,” says Urban Lime CEO Jonny Friedman. “But the city needs to do things. In my opinion it’s the psychological and physical links between north and south.”But, this sort of development is also synonymous with gentrification around the world. On Florida Road, it has meant higher rents and some angry tenants, most notably the owner of the restaurant Spiga, Marco Santoniccolo, who closed down his family eatery after nearly 17 years on Florida Road after rents climbed. Since reopening around the corner on Innes road, though, Santoniccolo has made peace with the changes and even welcomes the developments.Durban city centre may have been abandoned by some landlords and starved of services in the 1990s and 2000s but is neither a ghost town nor a crime-ridden chaos. It is home to many working-class black South Africans who have moved from townships and villages around the province of KwaZulu-Natal.Built over a transit hub that links minibus taxis and trains, Warwick Market offers everything from fresh vegetables to dried medicinal herbs. Among rows of wild spinach and sweet potatoes is a butchery that sells fresh offal and fish. There are stalls specialising in the uniform of the Zionist Christian Church, and others that will type a CV for R7. One sells DVDs of popular mbaqanga music artists a herbalist offers a mixture that will “help you find love”.It represents a third option: a more natural, bottom-up development that embraces all Durbanites, not just those who can afford to eat in the fancier restaurants of Florida Road or tourists paying for expensive beachfront hotels. The market largely caters to the residents who were willing to put up with Durban’s inner-city decay because they had no better option.Warwick market’s survival is testament to a moment of euphoria in post-apartheid South Africa in which officials, corporates and informal traders were willing to reconfigure the segregated city in the 1990s, explains Richard Dobson of Asiye eTafuleni (meaning ‘let’s go to the table’), a non-profit that represents the voices of informal traders in urban planning.This model was put to the test during Durban’s revamp as a so-called “world class city” fit for the World Cup, when the historic market faced demolition to make space for a shopping mall. It was ultimately saved by mass demonstrations, when thousands of vendors rallied together, forcing the city to rethink its development plan and improve the junction for people who already lived there.Dobson says the market functions well, with a turnover in the order of millions of pounds. It is vendors who keep the area safe and clean, not police or city workers.In many ways Warwick represents the kind of community buy-in and local participation that is only now beginning to occur on the beachfront, and has yet to occur in the city that lies right behind it. So, will Durban ever become a fully inclusive city?“You don’t do it by thinking that by putting black people living next to white people suddenly the white people are going to change,” says Sutcliffe, the former city manager. “That’s not going to happen. And it hasn’t happened. I think that all the evidence shows that kind of integration will take generations.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter.

And the British women we spoke to are indulging themselves, guilt-freeI’d be lying if I said I’d been looking forward to my 40s. Before the big birthday rolled around, I’d defined this decade as old. Boring. I was wrong. Speaking to other fortysomething women, I realised this is the time to forget about guilty pleasures. Here, we’re celebrating all out, straight-up pleasures. Some are everyday. Some are extravagant. They share one important theme: experiences over things equals enjoyment.‘I treated myself to a bike that’s turned me superhuman’Sarah Emslie, 41, osteopath, EdinburghI caught myself saying “I’m having a midlife crisis” to the guy in the bike shop and I kicked myself, because it’s nonsense. If I want to blow four figures on a super-fast aerodynamic time trial bike then I should celebrate. We don’t need to apologise for having fun. Racing head down, number on my back, I feel superhuman. I love how clear my head feels speeding downhill at 60km an hour. My favourite moments are when my wife, Laura, rides ahead of me, so I can take in the view of the mountains with her zooming down. I’m faster over the course than I was last year. It’s exhilarating to be 41 and still get better at your sport. I don’t feel my age. I don’t feel anything except that I’m me.‘I just enjoy being in a creative space’Helena Smith, 41, psychologist, KentThere are many hoops to jump through to get out of the house, especially because I’m a single mum, but my Tuesday life drawing class is worth it. I don’t give two monkeys about being good at sketching I just enjoy being in a creative space where I don’t think about work or bills or the stress of being a working mum because I’m so in the moment. Taking time out forces you into a different mindset. It’s been years since I did anything creative like this, because when you have babies it’s nearly impossible to do anything for yourself. During the two-hour class, time disappears completely. It’s my ultimate indulgence, because it’s purely for myself – nobody else’s benefit.‘Reading all morning is my ultimate indulgence’Minhe Currier, 41, stay-at-home mum, SurreyIf I don’t get time to myself I just don’t function. It’s not even an indulgence, it’s a sanity issue. As a married mother of a six-year-old, I automatically put myself last. But after the school drop-off, I open a book and read. In my 20s and 30s all I did was work. I was a broker in the city, starting work at 6.30am, leaving at 7pm and coming home without the emotional energy to read anything at all. Now I’m really into non-fiction because I’ve discovered life is much stranger than anything an author can make up. Recently I’ve read Harriet Harman’s autobiography, A Woman’s Work, which I think is good enough to rival Michelle Obama’s Becoming. Harman was a big childcare campaigner and reinforced the idea that parents are better people when they have their own lives. I couldn’t agree more.‘I get excited about an early night’Rhiannon Evans, 48, surveyor, CardiffI’m happier after a big sleep, and my skin looks happier, too. I get excited about an early night. I crave sleep and dream about my duvet during a rough day at work. I’m in bed by 10pm and I fall asleep quickly, often while I’m reading, but perimenopausal hormonal mayhem means I’m often awake for two or three hours in the middle of the night. It doesn’t help that my kids, aged 18 and 21, keep totally different hours to mine. At the weekend I might sleep until 10am, which is bliss.‘I never thought high street pasta could feel so extravagant’Zohreh Ghaffari, 48, radiographer, LondonIs it boring that my ultimate indulgence is eating pasta alle vongole until I can’t breathe? Add a nice glass of wine and finish up with chocolate and I’m a happy woman. In my 20s I ate out a lot without really thinking about it. Now going out for dinner is a mission: we need to book a babysitter and there are lots of stars that have to align workwise, because my husband and I both do shifts in different hospitals. But because we eat out so rarely, it feels special when we do. Sometimes we even have a random day off midweek together, so we treat ourselves and go for pasta on the high street while the kids are at school. That feels like a real indulgence.Beauty is ageless.

First, they all have good things going for them they would be really pleasant places to live if you could find a way to earn a living. Second, attractive as they are, I fear they were in better shape a couple of generations ago. And third, I wonder what the future holds for them.What I have really wanted to do is knock on the doors of sixth-form colleges, get the 17- and 18-year-olds together, and ask which of them is planning to make their lives in their home towns. Then I would ask those who wanted to be somewhere else why this was, and what it would take to get them to change their minds. These are really important questions, at the heart of inclusion, identity and opportunity. If answers aren’t found, our smaller places will risk withering on the vine, and our bigger places will get bigger and bigger, with all the ghastly consequences – air pollution, soaring house prices and so on. Look no further than the absurdly skyscraping skyline of Manchester now under construction. What are we thinking? For heaven’s sake, let’s just spread life around a bit more.The above list finishes with Weymouth, and not just because it is in alphabetical order. It was Weymouth that got me thinking this way. Last year, I was having my picture taken by an impressive woman working for this newspaper who had grown up there. She was in her 20s and living in north London. I asked her if she had ever considered making her life back home.“What would I do in Weymouth?” she shrugged.I get that – I left the West Midlands when I was 19, after all – but why does it have to be like this? What needs to happen for there to be jobs near these places, or ones that are easier to get to if they are not so near?I have pitched the idea to every media organisation that will take my call. Working title, WTF Would I Do in Weymouth? But none of this is new, of course, and plenty of research has been done looking at how to reverse the endless march towards the metropolis. The solutions are obvious, starting with much better transport, especially public transport, and better broadband. Both of these require massive public spending with electoral reward starting to pop its head up only in three parliaments’ time, at the earliest I would have thought. So we can probably dream on.NB: Regarding the places I have mentioned, I expect I will get furious communications along the lines of: “How dare you? This town is thriving!” All I can say is: bring it on. Honestly, I’d love to be wrong.• Adrian Chiles is a writer, broadcaster and  columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16da2f4c204343f0582690dc91c256de4f7ab4d8/0_2_3193_1916/master/3193.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81dca744a295598094c36cd6dd480bb0","title":"putin middle east russia turkey syria","story":"Recent events in Syria suggest that Russia isn’t just taking Washington’s place as the Middle East’s power broker – it seems to be doing a more effective job of it, too.The latest evidence came yesterday, when Vladimir Putin held a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. As a US-brokered ceasefire in Syria’s north-east expired, they struck a deal to evacuate the People’s Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish-led militia, from a buffer zone near Turkey’s border. Russian and Turkish troops will begin patrols of that area, giving them joint control. But while Russian diplomatic skill is to be commended, America’s loss may yet prove Russia’s headache.Few expected such a turn of events in 2015, when Russia launched a military operation in support of Bashar al-Assad. At the time, the Syrian president was at significant risk of losing control of his country to a disparate assortment of forces: US-backed groups including the YPG Turkish-backed forces Islamic State al-Qaida and others. Russia had several reasons to back Assad. He was a friend to Moscow, as his father had been before him. The Kremlin was concerned that if he fell, chaos would ensue – or Isis would fill the void. From a geo-strategic perspective, Russia had long opposed US-backed “regime change” interventions and was disinclined to let one more succeed. It was also keen to build influence in the Middle East and show itself to be a reliable partner. And while its involvement was in direct opposition to US efforts, Moscow likely believed that once it had proven itself a force to be reckoned with, it could establish its relevance to the US and cut some kind of arrangement with the Americans on the future of Syria and fight against Isis, thereby further cementing its great-power status and helping rebuild the two countries’ relationship.Russia’s military intervention in Syria had a decisive effect, reversing Assad’s slide. Cooperation with the Americans, however, proved elusive. But while Washington didn’t want to carve up influence and share it, a different dynamic nonetheless emerged. Erratic and shrinking US involvement, together with Moscow’s diplomatic skill, has now left Russia in what might seem an enviable position in Syria and in the region as a whole.All of this has been on display over the past fortnight, since Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from Syria for the third time in 18 months – this time combined with a tacit green light for Turkey to move into territory in Syria’s north-east controlled by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in which the YPG plays a leading role. Russia, for its part, has brokered a tactical arrangement between the YPG and Assad, supported Assad’s troops as they moved toward the border, kept them and Turkish forces at a distance from one another and,now, struck a deal with Ankara.Maintaining good relations with all sides has been at the centre of Moscow’s Middle East strategy. Unlike the US, which has historically ided the region into friends and enemies, Russia has taken a pragmatic approach. Where it has common interests with a country, it pursues them in cooperation. Where it disagrees, it accepts that each party will do what it can to get what it wants, even as they continue to coordinate on other matters. A lack of interest in criticising other countries for human rights violations (Russia itself is credibly accused of targeting civilians in Syria) rounds out a package bound to appeal to many Middle Eastern governments.As partner to all and ally to few, Moscow has been able to simultaneously protect the Syrian regime, turn a blind eye to Israeli strikes against Iranian assets, and help Israel and Iran avoid accidental clashes. It is also steadily improving its relationship with Saudi Arabia.But while Moscow’s current position in the Middle East appears advantageous, it presents challenges. As Assad consolidates power, his desire to follow Moscow’s lead, already tenuous, will likely diminish further. Russia’s relationship with Ankara does offer some continued leverage over Damascus. So, to an extent, does its pledge to protect the interests and security of the Kurdish community. However, neither Damascus nor Ankara is likely to make any real concessions to the YPG, raising questions of just what Moscow can deliver – and how long it can maintain good relations with all three parties.Looking ahead, Russia’s goals are unchanged. It still desires Assad’s control of a stabilised Syria and global acceptance of his continued rule, as well as guaranteeing its own long-term influence in the region. At the same time, it does not want to maintain a substantial military commitment in Syria, although it will likely seek a base or two.Assad seems well on the way to re-establishing control. But despite the deal with Ankara, stability, and thus Russian withdrawal, will be harder to achieve. Not only is resolution in the north-east far from assured, the northwest, where Idlib remains in jihadist hands, presents an equally complicated Gordian knot. Moreover, the reconstruction that would make peace sustainable requires resources beyond the means of Syria and Russia. International help and support might be more forthcoming if the YPG get a better deal and Idlib is resolved without a bloodbath, but Assad and Moscow will balk at demands for a political transition.Russia’s impressive juggling act in the Middle East, and in Syria in particular, has left it in a powerful position. But by filling the vacuum left by the US, it has had to take on far more responsibility than it may have expected or sought. To date it has managed well, but with few easy choices ahead and Syria in its current state, this may not be an enviable prize.• Olga Oliker directs the Europe and Central Asia programme at International Crisis Group"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b214da5274410cd8984a2662398037a78f2b805d/0_236_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4ec0d4152a0911229a9e459056383ff","title":"spanish state repression catalonia democracy basque","story":"The Spanish supreme court’s deeply unjust verdict, handing out harsh prison sentences to nine Catalan government and civil society leaders for organising a peaceful referendum on self-determination in Catalonia, is for many the sign of a country slipping towards authoritarianism and away from western European-style democracy. But truth be told, for us Basques, this kind of behaviour is nothing new.For years Spain was able to disguise its undemocratic essence under the cloak of the “fight against Basque terrorism”. Denial and rejection of the political nature of the armed conflict in the Basque country became quite easy for them, especially after 911. The line was that there was not a political problem in Spain, just a criminal one. “Spain is a democracy,” they used to tell us. “Everything is possible without violence” was the repeated mantra. We still remember the words of Spanish home secretary Alfredo P Rubalcaba: “They must decide: bombs or votes.”Yet when some of us in the pro-independence Basque movement began to convince those who still believed in violence to continue our struggle for self-determination by peaceful and democratic means, we were arrested and sentenced to lengthy jail terms.The truth is that Basque violence ended –not thanks to Spanish government efforts – but in spite of its persistent obstructions. (It is probably important here to clarify my position: many wrongs were done by the Basque side, many things happened that should not have done. We have acknowledged our share of the blame for the violence that was committed by both sides during years of conflict). My arrest – along with others – happened 10 years before the Catalan politicians were convicted of sedition, and it was only after we had served our prison term that the European court of human rights ruled our trial had been unfair (the second time the ECHR had ruled against Spain). The same could easily happen to the Catalans. The fact that the Spanish state still holds more than 240 Basque political prisoners in jail despite ETA ending its armed campaign in 2011 shows its lack of interest in a lasting peace.The verdict against the Catalan pro-independence leadership for organising a democratic and peaceful referendum, and the subsequent violence the Spanish police used against peaceful Catalan demonstrations, shows us what we always knew: the Spanish state is not interested in democracy and will use violence to conceal its undemocratic nature.This is why the state plays up, and at times instigates, violence in the region. The Spanish media and courts have even started talking about “terrorism” in the Catalan case. Spain will not hesitate to use this lie. Its government would love to transform Catalans’ legitimate and peaceful demand for self-determination into violence. That is what the police and military forces have been trying to do the last few days with their violent tactics.Fortunately, the Catalan nationalist movement is committed to peace. As we are in the Basque country. We know that our “force of reason” is stronger than their “reason of force”. At the same time we both are committed to achieving our fundamental democratic rights – Catalan and Basque demands for democracy will now only get louder. It is time to complete the unfinished business of Spain’s phoney transition to democracy – and there will not be real democracy in Spain until its plurinational character is recognised, just as in the UK or Canada.Rather predictably, Spain is going in the opposite direction: the direction of authoritarianism, counter-reform, the recentralisation of powers and responding to democratic demands with an iron fist. All this gives wings to the fascist extreme right. History shows us where this leads in the end.Repression, imprisonment and centralisation will not work. Like in most similar cases around the world there is no lasting solution to this kind of conflict without dialogue. Like in Northern Ireland, Scotland or Quebec, the only way to solve these tensions is through democracy. And anyone with a bit of political sense knows that the state needs to engage with legitimate Catalan representatives. A policy of repression with no talks and no negotiation is unacceptable.All the while, European institutions and states look the other way. Other European governments should be encouraging Spain to change track. Yet at the moment a desire to maintain internal stability within the bloc trumps all, and that means blind loyalty to Spain. This conflict can only be resolved internationally – European institutions and states should raise their voices in favour of a negotiated solution, before it is too late.• Arnaldo Otegi is the leader of the Basque independence party EH Bildu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9e526ca987fe0b8417d563e7b52d82a4f998731/4_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5b4e90864f04179dc5df3a6b75d97d4","title":"netflix most watched tv shows films figures","story":"The streaming giant has unveiled the most watched shows and films of the past year, suggesting what its future might look likeOne of the many disruptive qualities of so-called industry disruptor Netflix has been a lack of transparency over viewing figures. Unlike their competitors (the main networks and cable channels), they have never been held to the same standard, never judged by ratings, choosing to keep themselves separate, much to the rest of the industry’s frustration. But over time, a shift has taken place.Slowly but surely, the streaming goliath has started to share viewing data, usually as a brag and only when it shows them in a positive light, but with each shred of information we have started to see the bigger picture. Just last week, we were handed their most revealing dump to date, the 10 most popular original films and shows over the last 12 months, complete with figures for each. While we’re still starved of the bottom end of the list, and disappointingly yet tellingly, any box office data for their theatrical releases, we can start to see what is and isn’t working for the platform.If one were to examine the top 10 theatrically released films over the last year, the upper end, if not the entire list, would be dominated by franchises, sequels and ones that don’t necessarily rely on the names involved. But on Netflix, an underdeveloped alternative to the multiplex, the biggest films more closely resemble the box office hits of the late 80s and early 90s when star appeal was prioritised over spectacle, a period that saw Rain Man, Fatal Attraction, Ghost and Three Men and a Baby win big.The top three most-watched Netflix originals of the last 12 months are Bird Box (80 million viewers), Murder Mystery (73 million) and Triple Frontier (52 million), all broad, crowd-pleasing films sold almost exclusively on stars Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Aniston, Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, all of whom are actors who broke out in the 90s boasting fanbases that have mostly stayed loyal ever since. The mixture of recognisable casts, substantial budgets and experienced directors meant that they all looked like actual theatrical releases, too, making their drops feel like mini-events to viewers who might not have been anticipating their release.Inevitably, and ironically, the films that seemed to stand against the ongoing production line of predictable sequels being churned out by the wider industry are all now being envisioned as franchise-starters by those behind them. Murder Mystery 2 has been given the official green light, a follow-up to the Bird Box novel was announced earlier this year, leading many to speculate about an adaptation, while Triple Frontier director JC Chandor has expressed muted interest in a quadruple. Next year also sees sequels to the previous year’s hits The Kissing Booth and To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.By far, the platform’s biggest TV drop of the year is Stranger Things 3 (64 million viewers), an inevitable result given the frenzy surrounding the series since it began in 2016, but while it’s easy to equate its success to that of a big-screen sequel, especially given both its genre and how it’s been marketed, what’s most interesting is that it’s one of only two shows on the list that isn’t a first season. There’s no sign of Netflix staples like Orange is the New Black, Glow, Bojack Horseman, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, House of Cards, Black Mirror, The Crown, 13 Reasons Why and Mindhunter, and instead viewers have flocked to new shows like The Umbrella Academy (45 million viewers), You (40 million) and Sex Education (32 million), all also notably aimed at a younger audience.It’s a sign that either original shows tend to lose viewers with each season or that Netflix has been algorithmically tweaking its output to fall more closely in line with its most impassioned younger viewers. With all new shows on the list coming back for a second season, it will be interesting to see what next year’s results highlight.Importantly, the lists provided don’t include content acquired by Netflix from elsewhere which would inevitably mean that much-loved sitcoms like Friends and The Office would make an appearance. The success of both (Netflix extended the Friends deal for one final year for $100m before it was snapped up by HBO Max starting 2020) led many to believe that the practice of bingeing was mostly employed by those seeking lighter, snappier fare. But the appearance of two tough, issues-led dramas on Netflix’s TV list suggest that this might not always be the case.In a short amount of time, Unbelievable (32 million viewers) and When They See Us (25 million) have shown there’s a big audience for fact-based shows dealing with difficult, timely topics. Unbelievable, a combination of a dogged crime procedural and a docudrama, focused on rape and how it can be mishandled by authorities while When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Emmy-winning Central Park Five miniseries, dealt with race and how it too often leads to false imprisonment, and both were eagerly consumed by viewers and critics. Expect a major awards push for both in time for the Golden Globes as well as further green lights for equally tough-minded dramas.Genres that have long been cast aside by Hollywood have been carefully and cleverly resuscitated by Netflix for a while now with notable successes, such as 2018’s “Summer of Love” which saw a string of smash-hit romcoms, including Set It Up, To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before and The Kissing Booth (all of which Netflix has been happy to brag about). In comparison, before Crazy Rich Asians last year, the industry hadn’t seen a $100m romcom hit since 2011’s Just Go With It.The latest top 10 is filled with similar examples with teen movieromcom crossovers The Perfect Date (48 million viewers) and Tall Girl (41 million), psycho-thriller Secret Obsession (40 million), romcom Always Be My Maybe (32 million) and chick flick Otherhood (29 million) all scoring well. Apart from Otherhood, the films mentioned aren’t really star-led but their appeal is more about a tried-and-tested-and-forgotten-about formula being brought back to life. The success of “cheerfully trashy” thriller Secret Obsession, from longtime Hallmark and Lifetime channel director Peter Sullivan, is perhaps the most concerning given its rote plot and flat TV movie direction. It’s a cheap quickie that would usually be chucked on to cable but its large viewership on Netflix will lead to more of the same, a grubby inevitability and looking ahead at their schedule, there are similarly low-rent options in the coming months.The list of most-watched films, from Bird Box down to Fyre (20 million viewers) sees a gap of 60 million viewers, meaning that while some films hit big, there’s a great many that lag far, far behind. This doesn’t make them flops per se but it does mean that genuine phenomena are hard to find. The list also shows that while Netflix has put a great deal of funding into both their awards push and their splashy partnerships with respected auteurs, audiences are less invested in the outcome than they are.The most conspicuous absence is Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma, the platform’s most critically acclaimed and awarded film to date. Netflix might have been proud to flaunt its reviews, nominations and eventual wins but they have yet to release any solid data about either its streaming viewership or its limited run at the box office. There’s also no love for the Coen brothers and their anthology western The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Dan Gilroy’s Sundance-premiering art world horror Velvet Buzzsaw, the long-awaited Orson Welles drama The Other Side of the Wind, Paul Greengrass’s grim docudrama 22 July or Steven Soderbergh’s High Flying Bird. Of course, these films would have been unlikely to make the top 10 most-watched films at the cinema, too, but the film list offers a picture of a far less demanding viewer than the TV list and show’s a great discrepancy in the films that Netflix chooses to promote over what viewers choose to watch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42f141f7bd27ed1b400c43f54441cbb245f3facc/0_203_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=242fba310d3bf454165dabd2ecafd732","title":"liverpools 1000 year old oak is englands tree of the year","story":"Allerton Oak in Calderstones park will represent UK in Europe-wide competitionIt has been a courthouse, a source of comfort in war, and was cracked when a ship carrying gunpowder exploded nearby. Now the Allerton Oak in Liverpool has been voted England’s tree of the year and Britain’s representative for a European-wide competition.The Liverpool tree’s hefty boughs are propped up with metal poles and the oak carries many centuries’ worth of stories.Since Allerton lacked a courthouse in medieval times, it is believed to have been the meeting place for the local court. A large crack down its side was supposedly created by the Lottie Sleigh, a ship carrying 11 tonnes of gunpowder which exploded while moored in the Mersey nearby in 1864.During the second world war, leaves from the tree were sent with letters to local soldiers on the frontline to remind them of home.Scotland and Northern Ireland have also chosen their tree of the year in the competition, with the Woodland Trust deciding that the Allerton Oak will now represent the UK in the European Tree of the Year contest, which begins in February 2020.The Scottish winner is an elm that survived Dutch elm disease but stood forgotten beside Glen Affric until discovered by Forest and Land Scotland and Trees for Life staff. This survivor of an ancient forest is now surrounded by new, younger trees as part of a project to restore native woodland to the Highlands.In Northern Ireland, voters chose a sessile oak tree at the entrance to Rostrevor Oakwood, County Down, one of Ireland’s last remaining ancient woodlands. The tree became known as the “invisible tree” because it was omitted from a survey supporting the construction of an apartment block within a few metres of its roots and branches.

Trees are an important part of the urban landscape helping to make our towns and cities better places to live. We are keen to increase understanding of their value and promote their protection. We are currently working with partners to help increase tree cover in the city and make Liverpool a greener place to live.”The winning tree will be awarded £1,000 – supported by players of People’s Postcode Lottery – to help protect it.Liverpool city council and Mersey Forest are investing £80,000 in a new propping mechanism for the Allerton Oak, with built-in flexibility to adapt as the tree continues to grow.“We are determined to make sure it stays healthy for as long as possible,” said Cllr Laura Robertson-Collins, cabinet member for environment and sustainability at Liverpool county council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcefac59de4894cc93fa4cb4de3667415b5f2c76/586_510_2219_1332/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54bc3daa3e13218661e2d6332d7ee71c","title":"meps block move weaken eu rules bee harming pesticides","story":"Sixteen states and European commission had lobbied against planned guidanceThe European parliament has vetoed a move by member states and the European commission to weaken EU rules protecting bee colonies from toxic pesticides.MEPs blocked revised legislation that was said to ignore the risk to bee larvae from long-term exposure to chemicals, known as chronic toxicity.The MEPs instead argued a guidance document (pdf) produced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2013 should be fully implemented.The guidance seeks both to protect bees from adverse effects from a single exposure or multiple exposures over a short period of time, known as acute toxicity, and also long-term exposure.Sixteen member states, which have not been publicly named, lobbied against the full implementation of the guidance before the new rules are brought to a vote in the European parliament.Green MEPs who led the way on the parliamentary veto claimed the new generation of systemic pesticides, which are applied via seed treatment rather than spraying, made chronic exposure particularly relevant.Bee populations have collapsed around the world and the use of pesticides is said to be the main cause.A 2019 analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in the UK found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places in which they were found in 1980.Butterflies and mothsThere has been a “severe reduction” in butterflies and moths in the Kullaberg Nature Reserve in Sweden compared with 50 years ago. Scientists found over a quarter of the 600 species once found had been lost. Butterflies were hardest hit, losing almost a half of species, including the large tortoiseshell and scarce copper. In England, two-thirds of 340 moth species declined from 1968-2003.Museum records enabled scientists to assess the fate of 16 species of bumblebees in the US midwest from 1900 to 2007. They found four had completely died out, while eight were declining in number, and blamed intensive agriculture and pesticides.In the UK, dramatic declines in ground beetles have been seen in almost three-quarters of the 68 carabid species studied from 1994-2008. A few species increased, but overall one in six of all the beetles was lost in that time.The parliamentary veto was passed by 533 MEPs, with 67 voting against and 100 abstentions.Bas Eickhout, a Dutch Green party MEP, said: “The parliament’s objection is sending a strong signal to the commission not to bow to the pressure of member states and the agrochemical industry.“The parliament is demanding a new text that fully implements existing scientific guidelines. Bee populations are suffering everywhere, largely due to the use of pesticides, with major consequences for our ecosystems and food supplies.“Bees come into contact with small quantities of a pesticide over a long period of time and this is where the real problem lies that’s why chronic toxicity needs to be fully included in the assessment of pesticides.”Eickhout claimed pesticide producers had gone to great lengths to maintain their “toxic business model” and that the commission had been complicit in weakening protections.“This change of legislation has received relatively little attention so far because it has been discussed behind closed doors at the technical level. It’s time for the European commission to present a proper proposal at the political level so that member states can be held accountable for this issue and then many EU countries might change their tune,” he said.The chemicals were found to cause a wide range of harms including memory damage and a reduction in queen numbers. But the ban included an exemption for greenhouses, raising fears the chemical could still wash out into watercourses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31720bb43d94ffd7049e98263ebba040e15e1cd/0_0_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82b8eec9d955ef155fce8802db9231f8","title":"pumpkin waste uk halloween lanterns","story":"More than 8m squashes likely to be binned after annual lantern carving, study showsBritons are expected to generate record levels of food waste over Halloween this year.More than 8m pumpkins – equivalent to more than 18,000 tonnes of edible pumpkin flesh – will be heading for the bin because the majority of consumers will not eat it.Meanwhile, the UK’s first commercially brewed beer made from pumpkin flesh that would otherwise go to waste will go on sale at the end of November.Toast Ale, the social enterprise that three years ago launched a beer made from surplus bread, will brew the Belgian-style pumpkin dubbel using squashes collected by volunteers from local farms.Tessa Tricks, the head of food programmes at Hubbub, said: “It’s all too easy for people to forget that Halloween pumpkins are still food.

You might spot it on celebrities, on the cover of a magazine or on the bus. And then, suddenly it registers on the radar of wider culture. In the case of the headband, that was last week in parliament when Carrie Symonds, the partner of the prime minister, sat watching proceedings wearing a large, flocked, navy headband.As the Daily Mail wrote the next day – in a feature asking: ‘Are you posh enough for a powerband?’ – there is something decidedly upper-crust about this item. Other fans include: the sisters with names worthy of Waugh Lady Alice and Violet Manners Princess Beatrice, who wore one to a garden party, and Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s ex, who wore one to Princess Eugenie’s wedding.I do struggle to think of my mum – more inclined to the artistic school of dressing – doing the same. It’s fair to say that I am not posh enough for the powerband. I have never knowingly been to a garden party. I haven’t even watched The Crown. I certainly don’t dress like a Sloane Ranger – I’m more likely to be found in a band T-shirt or hoody, and I am rarely out of trainers. I am, however, always interested in finding out how the other half live (or, at least, do their hair). So I try the headband out.I wear a straw version to dinner at my sister’s house (this passes largely without comment, although my boyfriend says it looks “a bit Handmaid’s Tale”) and to hang out with friends on Saturday. One of them says it looks like I have borrowed sunglasses from Star Trek’s Geordi La Forge and pushed them up to my forehead, which is novel. Commuting home on a drizzly Monday, I wear a green one, decorated with punk studs. Standing in a packed carriage, I think a woman nudges her friend and laughs at my headband. I don’t blame her.My takeaways? The reactions are fine – but it takes a while to get used to having a huge great thing on your head. To use an entirely non-posh word, it just feels a bit extra, like wearing a crown when you’re doing the weekly shop. Going to work in a striped number with pearls, I end up tying my hair back and matching my clothes to the headband. Off comes my usual sweatshirt and gold hoops, replaced with an old Chloé blouse with wide sleeves and some diamante cross earrings. Pretty posh. For me, anyway.As well as Princess Beatrice and friends, powerbands can be traced to the catwalk. For springsummer 2019, every model at Prada wore padded designs, from pink satin to black and beaded. Brands including Erdem, Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana and Simone Rocha have had them, too. The more ornate ones have also been linked to the Renaissance being so hot right now – a portrait of Anne Boleyn from circa 1533 has the then-queen wearing a very 2019 pearl headband. Accessorize is selling a simple, black style called the Boleyn for £9.Headbands have history before 1533. Fashion historian Tony Glenville says they can be traced back to the Greeks and Romans, and from medieval times, head-dresses – similar to Boleyn’s – were used by women to tie long hair back. Until the 20th century, women did not commonly cut their hair, he says.The alice band we know today originates in John Tenniel’s illustrations for 1871’s Through the Looking Glass, in which Alice wears a ribbon to tie her hair back. Glenville says this image means the headband has always been seen as a “simple and youthful style” and in the 1920s they were worn, across the forehead, by the Bright Young Things. You could argue the Sloanes, attending parties such as the Rose Ball in their headbands and puffball dresses, were picking up on the history of those hedonistic rich kids. “The original idea is about simplicity and practicality,” says Glenville. “The ribbon holding long, luxuriant hair back.”While there have been other headband moments since the 1980s (see Blair Waldorf in Gossip Girl), York says the trend is properly back now because – in common with most fashion revivals – enough time has passed between revivals, and we’re able to see the charm of those 80s references. This is certainly true for Emma Elwick-Bates, contributing editor of American Vogue, and headband aficionado. “To me, the style recalls young Diana and Fergie, at ease and joyful,” she says. “And my perennial fashion favourite - Princess Caroline.”Whether it is through sheer laziness or a way to be more Teigen, I’m starting to think the headband could be reclaimed beyond those who appear in Debrett’s. I’m going to give it a try this party season. If you see me on the tube, try not to laugh.

He’s got a reasonably affectionate family living nearby and seems to have a few friends – or at least one, in the shape of co-worker Gavin (Cameron Fulton), a queeny quipper who is possibly the only gay person in the village.However, Brian is desperately lonely, tortured by suicidal thoughts and unable to share his troubles with anyone around him. One night, just as he is on the verge of jumping off a cliff on to the rocks below, a kindly stranger, Jeff (Stephen McCole), pulls him away from the edge, literally and metaphorically. Then he persuades Brian to open up a little, and help out at the care home he runs.This leads to a meet-cute with single mother Sam (Siobhan Reilly), and Brian eventually starts to make more connections with the people around him, finding little tethers to keep him from falling into the same ever-beckoning pit of despair that many others in the community – and even people in Brian’s immediate orbit – have fallen into. Before the end credits roll, on-screen text explains that suicide is the biggest killer of men under 45 in this country a terrible statistic that is shocking but sadly not surprising.Writer-director Marilyn Edmond’s film is clearly aiming to dramatise this problem in an accessible way, but unfortunately too often plays like a pamphlet in a GP’s waiting room brought to life. Working with sketchy characters who are little more than clusters of symptoms, the actors seem to be flailing to breathe life into the material. Worst of all, the last-scene twist is ill-considered and entirely off-message.• Connect is released in the UK on 25 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/525bc49b3f9e4298b15e757ca33906de2194f804/0_184_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4ad92bda167c91419c23b9db81d178","title":"jon favreau says scorsese coppola earned right to swipe at marvel movies","story":"Veteran directors are still his heroes, says younger film-maker, despite dismissal of superhero fare such as his own Iron Man moviesJon Favreau, director of Iron Man, the first Marvel Cinematic Universe feature film, has responded to recent criticism of blockbuster superhero movies voiced by auteur directors Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.As well as Iron Man, Favreau has directed its follow-up, Iron Man 2, the recent Disney remakes of The Jungle Book and The Lion King, and is the creator of the Star Wars spin-off TV show The Mandalorian coming out in the US next month.Favreau added: “They can express whatever opinion they like.”But directors including James Gunn (s of the Galaxy) and Joss Whedon (The Avengers) have defended the genre, with Gunn writing on social media: “Superheroes are simply today’s gangsterscowboysouter space adventurers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99ffd4775dbb5d48119c828d5831053caafc52b/22_248_2065_1238/master/2065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=253a2ea2963e73b4bc335827188bc2e6","title":"lost history of soviet hippies documentary communism","story":"It was a subculture shaped by communism, inspired by the west – and watched by the KGB. Now, a new documentary charts the movement’s charismatic leaders, conflicts and futureIn 1968, Aksel Lampmann was a teenager growing up in Soviet Estonia. That summer, he went to an international camp, where he met students from Czechoslovakia and began listening to the Beatles. He didn’t understand the lyrics (“No one spoke English back then”), but loved the sound. “We had no clue what they were singing about. What a strange vibration!”He learned guitar and grew his hair. By 1969, Lampmann had become a full-blown Soviet hippy. The iron curtain made a road trip to the US impossible, so he hitchhiked from his home in the Baltics to Crimea. “Our lives were more colourful, more alive,” he says. “Other people didn’t have the same encounters or emotions.”Lampmann is one of the stars of Soviet Hippies, a film by the Estonian writer and director Terje Toomistu about a lost period in Soviet history. The documentary explores a subculture that was inspired by the west yet distinctly homegrown – existing in a society shaped by communism and watched over by the KGB.“In the west, nobody was arrested simply for having long hair or wearing strange clothes,” Toomistu explains. The USSR, by contrast, wanted complete control of its citizens’ lives: how people worked, dressed, or even danced. Anyone who rejected the Homo sovieticus model could be in “big trouble”, including having their hair forcibly cut.The Soviet hippy movement emerged in Moscow and Leningrad around 1966 and 1967, in the early years of Leonid Brezhnev’s rule. The first red hippies were the sons or daughters of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura – well-behaved kids from elite families. They had access to music from the capitalist world and to jeans. By the early 70s, the movement had grown sufficiently big and unruly to alarm the authorities – though it probably only ever numbered a few thousand, Toomistu says. The secret police began tailing the long-haired to school. In June 1971, the hippies were given permission to demonstrate against the Vietnam war outside the US embassy in Moscow.This was a trap. The KGB rounded up and arrested demonstrators, with the goal of wiping out hippy culture. Some demonstrators were sent to psychiatric facilities and injected with insulin others dispatched to the army and camps near the Chinese border. The film re-creates this grim clampdown and uses surveillance photos found in KGB archives in Lithuania.According to Lampmann, harassment by the police and KGB was common. “One of my close friends ended up in prison,” he says. Hippies were persecuted under criminal rather than political law. They could find themselves sharing a cell with gangsters and murderers. To avoid arrest, Lampmann always kept his documents in perfect order.By the late 70s, the hippies had developed a counterculture, with Russian slang and a music scene. There was what Toomistu calls “analogue Facebook” – notebooks listing names and numbers of contacts across the USSR, used by travellers seeking somewhere to crash for the night. This network is gloriously animated in the film, which features psychedelic drawings and cartoons.The underground subculture connected people from different social backgrounds, the writer Vladimir Wiedemann says. It included hippies, dissidents, mystics, religious activists and human-rights campaigners. Some embraced spiritualism, others yoga and veganism. All rejected the Soviet regime and thus played a role in its eventual demise.Wiedemann was exposed to rock’n’roll culture via Finnish TV and Radio Luxembourg, which he could pick up from his home in Estonia. “The iron curtain wasn’t that strong,” he says. Now based in London, Wiedemann wrote a book on hippies, Forbidden Union, which is currently running as a play, How Estonian Hippies Brought Down the Soviet Union!, on the Moscow stage...The film features interviews with Wiedemann and other survivors from the “hairy underground”, as Toomistu puts it. Most are men, still espousing hippy ideas and with beards and hair still flowing but grey. There are fewer Soviet female hippies, Toomistu says many left the scene to have children. The movement’s charismatic leaders are largely dead, often from drink and drugs.These were widely available under Marxism. Forbidden from travelling physically beyond the eastern bloc, Soviet hippies instead became “psychonauts”, Toomistu says. They consumed weed from central Asia and the Caucasus, opium and poppy tea. Some drank Sopals, a Soviet cleaning detergent containing ether.Toomistu grew up in post-Soviet Estonia. She was interested in the hippy scene as a teenager, and was a fan of Jim Morrison. She spent half a year in Russia as a student, and wrote a thesis about memory culture. The idea for the film came together after her own road trip in South America, she says. She is currently completing an anthropology PhD. There is little archive material on communist-era hippies, whom the Soviet press ignored, Toomistu says, erasing them from history. She retrieved a box of video footage of festivals and gatherings from a hippy who had to leave Russia in a hurry. In 2017, several of her subjects went to a hippy reunion held every year at Moscow’s Tsaritsyno Park, to mark the 1971 demo busted by the KGB.The reunion is poignant. Russia’s war in Ukraine and its 2014 annexation of Crimea ided opinion. Some hippies support Vladimir Putin and his idea of a great spiritual Russia. Others take a more traditional pacifist view that all war is bad. The film ends with Putin’s police breaking up the party. It is a metaphor for state-hippy relations, now and then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/814577a1704f938068991efc7cd910f530bfff92/131_0_2336_1402/master/2336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8af6a584379abcd47e92add7b039645","title":"the pilgrims progress review animation john bunyan","story":"This animated adaptation of Bunyan’s 17th-century religious allegory features some scary demons but the rest is pretty tamePity the poor year-nine students who henceforth will be plonked in front of this plodding, sanctimonious animation of John Bunyan’s 1678 religious allegory as “a treat” in RE class.

After one of them goes missing, leaving behind a house full of visionary sketches and a book about the Celestial City, Christian Pilgrim (voiced by Ben Price) follows him into the unknown, abandoning his family. First stop on his journey is the Swamp of Despair. At Vanity Fair he must resist the temptations of the flesh – painted ladies, cakes galore – while at points along the road he is visited by the kindly Evangelist, who looks like Jesus with a Kate Middleton blow dry.If not much else, The Pilgrim’s Progress has got some cracking, genuinely nightmare-inducing demons. Christian goes sword to sword with the devil’s henchman, a winged creature with horns and the pecs of champion bodybuilder. Less interesting is the characterisation of the female giant Diffidence as a battle-axe wife – the kind of pinny-wearing, rolling-pin wielding stereotype that belongs in the 17th century.

These days, I enjoy the crumbly, buttery shortcrust almost as much as the syrupy filling, but I still serve it with custard. And not the fancy kind, either.For the pastry (or use 300g ready-made plain shortcrust)200g plain flour, plus extra to dustFine salt100g cold butter, plus extra to grease3-4 tbsp ice-cold water1 egg, beaten with a little waterFor the filling60g butter400g golden syrup35g treacle2 tbsp double cream1 whole egg plus 1 egg yolk1 tbsp lemon juice140g fresh breadcrumbs, preferably brownIf you’re making your own pastry, which I would recommend, start with that, because it will need time to chill. Put the flour in a large bowl with a pinch of salt. Grate in the butter – lightly flour its surface occasionally to make the job easier – then rub it into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles damp sand.Gradually add just enough cold water to bring the mix together into a smooth dough – don’t overdo it, or the pastry will shrink in the oven. Form into a ball, then flatten to make a disc. Wrap well to keep it airtight, then chill for at least 30 minutes if you make it a few hours ahead, and it feels very hard, get it out of the fridge half an hour before you want to use it.Heat the oven and a baking sheet to 190C (180C fan)390Fgas 5, and grease a deep, loose-bottomed 23cm tart tin with butter. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface until it’s about 5mm thick, then lift it into the tin to line it. Lightly prick the base in several places with a fork.Put a piece of foil on top of the pastry case, weigh it down with baking beans, rice or dried pulses, and blind bake for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 60g butter in a medium pan, add the syrup and treacle, and heat until warm. Stir in the cream and take off the heat.Beat in the egg, egg yolk, lemon juice and a quarter- or half-teaspoon of salt to taste, then set aside. After the pastry case has been baking for 15 minutes, remove the foil and beans, and brush the egg wash all over the pastry. Return to the oven and bake for another five minutes, until golden.Take the shell out of the oven and turn down the temperature to 170C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. Tip in the breadcrumbs and spread them out evenly. Pour the syrup mixture over the top, making sure there are no dry patches, then return to the oven for another 20 minutes.Turn the heat down to 150C (140C fan)320Fgas 2½ and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown, and the filling set on top, but with a little bit of wobble left in the centre (check it regularly during this last period of baking, and cover with foil if the pastry is browning too quickly).Remove the tart from the oven and leave to cool to just warm before serving – if you try to tuck in while it’s still hot, it will be hard to cut, though still extremely delicious. And if you make it in advance, you can warm it through gently before serving. Serve with custard, cream, ice-cream, or all three if you’re feeling particularly decadent.If you must mess around with a classic, Nigel Slater’s idea of stirring a little ground ginger into the filling is a nice warming one, or you could go down the James Martin route and decorate it with thin slices of stem ginger. Grated lemon zest or ground cardamom would also work in the filling. Or serve it, as Slater suggests, with a scoop or two of sorbet instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4309ac5021e1923da7f2f344097995c371a8c78/704_13_2296_1377/master/2296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=603bff5208a009b8625a9cb914b4a26a","title":"bayern munich ralf rangnick manchester united","story":"Bayern Munich are considering Ralf Rangnick as an option should performances not improve under Niko Kovac with Manchester United also monitoring the situation.Kovac is under renewed pressure at the Bundesliga club following the 2-2 draw against Augsburg at the weekend and the unconvincing 3-2 win at Olympiacos on Tuesday night.

He made his Spain debut in June and has earned five caps for his country.Napoli paid the buyout clause of €30m (£25.5m) when they signed him from Betis last year but will expect a significant return on that investment if he leaves in the summer.The Napoli chairman, Aurelio De Laurentiis, said last week: “I paid €30m for Fabián and he’s a fantastic player. If some of the European top clubs were to offer €180m we can start talking about selling him.”The relationship between Napoli and Manchester City took a turn for the worse when the Premier League club were interested in Jorginho, who ended up joining Chelsea together with the then Napoli coach, Maurizio Sarri, but that issue is not expected to be a problem an offer for the player meets Napoli’s valuation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4605e04c97eb343f4cef64538b44c7c323e8c6b/224_242_722_433/master/722.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97cf14a60a3f6f97db73b6db37a11ab0","title":"spanish women footballers strike","story":"• ‘We have to fight for our rights,’ says Bilbao’s Ainhoa Tirapu• Players’ strike expected to start on 16 NovemberSpain’s women footballers have voted to go on strike after negotiations over a collective agreement with the clubs broke down over minimum salary and part-time contracts.“We’re going on strike,” said the Athletic Bilbao captain, Ainhoa Tirapu, flanked by almost 200 players from the 16 clubs that compete in the first ision.

On 19 August, they suffered a 6-1 reversal away to champions Dundalk in the league-cup semi-final. Is this the biggest swing in the margin of victorydefeat for a team in consecutive games?” asks John Shortall.So, 14’s the score to beat. Earlier this month, symmetrical swings also added up to that number in the Northern Premier League, as Richard Worrall observes. “They had a 7-0 home win (v Grantham Town) on 8 October four days later on 12 October they lost by a similar score playing away to FC United.”“Funnily enough we just saw a bigger swing in the World Cup qualifiers,” says Chris Page. “Iran registered a 14-0 win over Cambodia, before falling 1-0 to Bahrain five days later. That’s a swing of 15.”Eighty years ago, Robert Kaye reckons Hull City matched the 15-goal swing: on 31 December 1938 they lost 2-6 to Bradford, but next time out – on 14 January – they thumped Carlisle 11-0.However, the Oceania 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign can trump it, says Pablo Miguez. “Tonga defeated Samoa 1-0 in the opening game. They faced Australia in the second match, losing 22-0. I believe this was – for two days – a World Cup qualifying record … until Australia defeated American Samoa 31-0.” Australia ended their four-game campaign with a goal difference of +66.Meanwhile, Chris Rawson found two teams playing back-to-back in late 1963, with a nine-goal swing ensuing: “On Boxing Day, Burnley hosted United (Bobby Charlton et al) at Turf Moor and ran out 6-1 winners, with future United star Willie Morgan scoring twice in front of 35,764. Two days later, the reverse fixture was held at Old Trafford, with United winning 5-1 having brought back the 17-year-old George Best to wear the No 11 shirt!”Page has the final word, however. “You’d be hard pressed to topple AS Adema’s tally from 2002. On 31 October they recorded their famous world record 149-0 win over SO l’Emyrne. Ten days later, they were eliminated from the Coupe de Madagascar, losing 3-2 to Fifafifi Toamasina. That’s a swing of 150. I can’t imagine anyone else having a greater fall from grace than that.” So: anyone have 151?“Apart from Oxford United,” tweets Mighty Alan, “which grounds have no seatingstand at one end of the ground?”Three-sided grounds aren’t uncommon. Martin O’Gorman contributes Central Coast Stadium, home to A-League’s Central Coast Mariners. “At least the view distracts from the dire football being played on the pitch,” he snorts.One spare end can be found at the homes of various Scottish sides, Kevyn Whitelaw observes. One end of Partick Thistle’s Firhill is open, “where once there was a decent-sized terrace”. Hamilton Accies, who they used to groundshare with, “relocated to a new stadium which also has one end open, with a double decker bus often parked there.”Michael Haughey adds Falkirk Stadium, which has only three stands and a fence down one touchline. He also cites Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas, home to Rayo Vallecano, with its permanent wall of advertising hoardings at one end …Whitelaw continues: “I had a season ticket at Rayo Vallecano for a couple of years. Directly behind the hoardings are flats that overlook the ground. Locals used to ‘rent out’ balcony spaces for the bigger matches.”“However, the above can be bested,” Haughey says. “Since the turn of the millennium, the home of the sons of the rock, Dumbarton FC, has been a one-sided stadium with a fence running around the pitch.”Rob McEvoy has word of opportunism from Thailand: “BG Pathum United have the three-sided Leo Stadium which is missing a stand down the side. The reason for this is that for some unknown reason they built the stadium close to the edge of their large plot of land (an old bottling plant, BG stands for Bangkok Glass).”The neighbours: a car showroom. “Realising the club need that land, they want a kings ransom for it. The three sides built are really good as well. Interestingly, the owner of Oxford is Thai too, although he didn’t build the ground.”Any more strange tales behind wonky stadiums? Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.“Have any managers or coaches been injured during a game while sitting on the bench or in the technical area?” asked Davide Corran in August 2009.Some managers, it seems, are a magnet for trouble. Take Sydney FC’s John Kosmina. “John Kosmina was flattened by Danny Allsopp of Melbourne Victory during a game,” suggests James Coppard. “I don’t think he was badly hurt at all but, this wasn’t the first time he’s had a tangle with a Melbourne player – in 2006, Victory’s Kevin Muscat sent him tumbling too, while Kosmina was manager of Adelaide United. Personally, what I find weirdest is how the ‘bench’ at Melbourne’s games appears to be flimsy garden chairs atop a plastic sheet? Surely that’s just asking for trouble.”It should be pointed out that Kosmina, though floored, seemed to suffer little or no ill-effects from his tangles with opposition players. And, despite taking a trip to A\u0026ampE, neither was Tromso coach, Harald Abrekk, after this incident (there’s a little footage of the actual event scattered throughout the Norwegian phoenix-from-the-flames style reconstruction). “This took place in on 16 May 1995 at Aspmyra Stadium in Bodo,” writes Jostein Nygard. “In this northern Norwegian ‘derby’ between BodoGlimt and Tromso (Bodo and Tromso might be 200 miles apart, but it’s still considered a ‘derby’ here), on the most important round of the year (the night before the National Day), the Tromso coach, Harald Abrekk, was taken to the hospital after being ‘hit’ by the BodoGlimt physio.“It’s in Norwegian, but you should get a good impression of what happened,” he adds rather optimistically of the video footage. “In the interview he tells about how they were up 2-1, and he did it to ‘waste time’ (the match ended 2-1, so I guess it worked). ‘Were you hurt?’ ‘No.’ ‘Did it hurt at all?’ ‘No.’”One manager who certainly was hurt in the dugout was the former Tottenham manager Juande Ramos. The then Sevilla manager was knocked unconscious by an object thrown from the Real Betis crowd after Freddie Kanouté had equalised for the visitors in the city derby and the match was abandoned.Unfortunately Ramos is not alone in finding the technical area in Spain a dangerous place. The Real Sociedad coach Juan Manuel Lillo needed stitches after being struck by an object thrown from Real’s own fans during the club’s 0-0 draw with Eibar in November 2008.But managers aren’t always the victims of touchline violence, as Joe Marshall points out: “I seem to remember Trevor Francis punching reserve team goalkeeper Alex Kolinko in the face when he was manager of Crystal Palace. I believe this resulted in Kolinko receiving a bloody nose.”• For more from the font of nerdvana, click this thing here.From Anthony Gee: “This weekend Dundee United, who were top of the Scottish Championship, were beaten 4-0 by Queen of the South.

But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

He has become one of the players adopted by the Japanese media following the departure of their team from the tournament after losing to the Springboks.No player trod more over the dreams of the host nation than De Klerk, whose kicking, sniping and ability to read Japan’s lines of attack and snuff out moves at their point of origin earned him the award for man of the match, although some in South Africa complained he should have released the ball more, a tactic that got Ireland nowhere in their group match against the host.Yet two years ago, De Klerk’s prospects of appearing in this tournament looked no more likely than Jaco Peyper being made honorary president of the French Referees’ Society. He made his Test debut in the summer of June 2016 in the series against Ireland, the first of 11 caps in a year that turned out to be South Africa’s worst with eight defeats, culminating in a reverse to Wales in Cardiff that saw him sent to the sin-bin. Five scrum-halves, none of whom is here, were to be tried by South Africa before De Klerk’s time unexpectedly came again.He left the Lions for Sale in 2017. South Africa then had a rule that overseas players with fewer than 30 caps would not be considered by the Springboks but, such was the immediate impact he made, the stipulation was dropped when Rassie Erasmus took charge at the beginning of last year.“The main thing for me at Sale was that the role I was given needed me to make a difference to the team,” De Klerk said. “Responsibility came my way in terms of how we wanted to play, whether kicking or running. I kicked goals and took restarts and it all helped to get me to where I am now.Erasmus wasted no time in summoning De Klerk from exile. The scrum-half started the first Test against England in 2018, dictating the pace of the game after the tourists had taken a healthy lead. His scuttling and perpetual motion exploited the problems Eddie Jones’s team then had at the breakdown.It was what Sale’s supporters had become used to, but it was a markedly different player who had struggled to make any sort of impact at international level in 2016, admittedly as part of a team who lacked authority and direction. The tame defeat against Wales, the side they face in Sunday’s semi-final in Yokohama, summed up where they were before Erasmus’s timely arrival.“The only time I have faced Wales was three years ago,” said De Klerk, who was shown his yellow card that day for deliberately knocking on a pass intended for Gareth Davies, who will again be his opposite number on Sunday. “We had a completely different way of playing and attacking then and we did not get into what made them tick and play. In just one session this week, we were given a broad view of what they bring and where their threats are.“As a team we are now more in tune with how an opponent wants to play and we are able to counter the stuff that they bring: we are better than we have been for a few years. It is going to be a slippery one on Sunday because any team who reach this stage of a World Cup will pose threats, but Rassie knows what his players bring and he backs us. It is up to us to perform.”It is 12 years since South Africa won the cup and their other success in the tournament came 12 years before that. Those campaigns were based on defence and here they have conceded three tries in five matches, two to New Zealand on the opening weekend. They overwhelmed Japan with their mighty muscularity and refusal to indulge in a frolic.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletter“We have one of the biggest packs in the World Cup,” De Klerk said. “You can have size but to be physical is a different story. Every guy has brought that here and when one gets subbed, it seems like an even bigger one comes on. Eben Etzebeth gives players around him a standard to keep up with. We know what works for us and what doesn’t.”At 12st 6lb (80kg) and 5ft 7in (1.72m), De Klerk would seem out of place in the land of the giants but what he lacks in size he makes up for in aggression. “We were nice and physical last weekend and we will be up for it again,” he said. “Wales will be different to Japan and it will be about finding space. One of the features of this tournament is that it has shown what matters is the size of your heart rather than your body. If you are ready to work hard you will reach your dreams. I play to inspire people and give confidence to young kids who might shy away because of their size.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74e37d6f885a54995f331741fb1d4607d0701a3b/0_223_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb38c47f252ef4a28bd2323dd5e5c8bd","title":"paralympic gold medalist marieke vervoort ends her life in belgium","story":"Paralympian Marieke Vervoort said when the day arrived, she had signed the euthanasia papers and was prepared to end her life. That day came on Tuesday in her native Belgium, her death confirmed in a statement from the city of Diest.Vervoort, 40, won gold and silver medals in 2012 at the London Paralympics in wheelchair racing, and two more medals three years ago in Rio de Janeiro.In an interview at the Paralympics in Rio, Vervoort described living with unbroken pain from an incurable, degenerative spinal disease. She talked of sleeping only 10 minutes some nights, described severe pain that caused others to pass out just watching her, and detailed how sport kept her alive.“It’s too hard for my body,” Vervoort said in the 2016 interview. “Each training I’m suffering because of pain. Every race I train hard. Training and riding and doing competition are medicine for me. I push so hard – to push literally all my fear and everything away.”Vervoort was a strong advocate of the right to choose euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. Like training hard, she said it gave her control and put “my own life in my hands”.“I’m really scared, but those (euthanasia) papers give me a lot of peace of mind because I know when it’s enough for me, I have those papers,” she said. “If I didn’t have those papers, I think I’d have done suicide already. I think there will be fewer suicides when every country has the law of euthanasia. I hope everybody sees that this is not murder, but it makes people live longer.”Vervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.A loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. Zenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, she said, and helped carry groceries home when Vervoort bought too much. “When I’m going to have an epileptic attack, she warns me one hour before,” Vervoort said. “I don’t know how she feels it.”Vervoort said she kept pushing back the day of her death, knowing it could come anytime — as it can for anyone. She said she can be pain-free one minute, and nearly pass out a few minutes later. “You have to live day-by-day and enjoy the little moments,” she said. “Everybody tomorrow can have a car accident and die, or a heart attack and die. It can be tomorrow for everybody.”Vervoort called herself a “crazy lady”. She talked of flying in an F-16 fighter jet, riding in a rally car, and she was curating a museum of her life going back to at least 14 when she was diagnosed with her rare illness. She had spikey hair and wanted to be remembered as the lady who was “always laughing, always smiling”.“I feel different about death now than years ago,” Vervoort said. “For me I think death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and you never wake up.

There was basically nothing left to flog.For those who’ve missed the saga of the NBA’s travails in China, have no fear. It isn’t going away any time soon, with last weekend’s development being groups of fans wearing masks and “Stand With Hong Kong” T-shirts standing in protest at the Brooklyn Nets pre-season finale at the Barclays Center, in a show of support unlikely to be looked on fondly by the People’s Republic. Tuesday night’s opening NBA games were duly blacked out by China’s state broadcaster.First, though, a recap of the story: earlier this month, the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. In fairly short order, the Rockets stated that his views did not reflect those of the team, while the NBA informed the world it was “regrettable” Morey’s tweet had caused offence. You know you’re in dangerous territory when you’re reduced to nodding along with Ted Cruz, but the Texas senator declared: “We’re better than this human rights shouldn’t be for sale and the NBA shouldn’t be assisting Chinese communist censorship.” Suggesting there may yet be one bipartisan issue left in the US, the Democratic hopeful Beto O’Rourke was soon voicing similar sentiments. Alas, none of these were really what the Chinese government wanted to hear, leading to the state threatening to cut ties with the NBA. Some Chinese companies have pulled sponsorship.Slightly changing tack, the NBA mounted a grimly mealy-mouthed defence of Morey, with the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, explaining: “I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.” Over to Chinese state television. “We’re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver’s claim to support Morey’s right to freedom of expression,” CCTV said in a statement. “We believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.”As for who should give a toss what they believe, unless you’re Chinese and have no choice … enter LeBron James. Given what a powerful voice the Lakers star has been for civil rights in the US, there was a certain amount of disappointment that he opted to say of Morey: “I believe he wasn’t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke. Just be careful what we tweet … even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.”Though James walked back the statement almost in real time, given the reaction to it, it wasn’t quick enough for rightwing pundits, who continue to jump on it, as well as the failure of other stars to speak out in support of the protesters. Yes, those who for so long lacerated sports stars for getting political are now demanding to know why they aren’t. Athletes who have been told shut up and play are now told to speak out, and criticised if they don’t. Suddenly, the last thing anyone seems to want them to do is “stick to basketball”.Silver himself has found slightly more of a backbone, revealing he resisted Chinese demands to fire Morey. China denies this version, and CCTV stated he will face “retribution sooner or later” for it. As for how this huge and deepening mess will play out for the NBA, it isn’t clear, though it would be nice to think politicians and pundits may grasp that it’s not actually up to LeBron James to sort out China.But in the wider contexts of sports, the affair should be viewed as highly instructive as an indication of the lengths to which the Chinese state will go to collect on their various deals. We saw glimpses of this in the Beijing Olympics, where promises to the IOC about freedom to protest were broken once the event was under way. But it apparently wasn’t alarm-bell ringing enough for the IOC not to award Beijing with the 2022 Winter Olympics.Will it be enough for Fifa? Like the IOC, Fifa loves an authoritarian regime in which to locate their quadrennial mega-event – it makes things so much easier on a lot of levels – and the chatter that the 2030 World Cup may just end up going to China is getting louder with every month.Meanwhile, the tale should also be cautionary for the Premier League and its bigger clubs, which have ever-increasing commercial and even physical presences in China. If athletes or management staff or even banner-toting fans should speak out visibly on this, or other current or future Chinese issues, it feels reasonable to assume some version of the NBA saga could take place.Forms of self-censorship for commercial gain in China are already being “strongly encouraged” by other entertainment businesses. According to a recent Buzzfeed report, some showrunners on Apple’s new original programming slate were instructed by Apple leadership to avoid negative portrayals of China. The video game company Blizzard suspended a player for voicing support for Hong Kong protesters.All sorts of sports are may find their businesses getting sucked into this nasty business because, instead of staying the irrelevance they may prefer, the question is moving centre stage: what price market access?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec9f406051b57ae5eeb99ae9543cdd53e02d8c54/54_0_3023_1814/master/3023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9e4aeb40b63b87ff42691056e6af2b2","title":"rugby world cup four players who can light up semi final weekend","story":"It can all be cart before the horse in the days preceding such big games as we await the World Cup semi-finals in Japan. Coaches take to front and centre – some by choice, others by the path of convention and process. Perhaps it’s mindgames to distract their opponents or perhaps to allow players the shelter before the show. However, if those coaches have got their planning and peaking right then they will slowly step back into the shadows and it will be their players that step into the limelight.I think we all want the two semi-finals to be decided by moments of brilliance and not crass stupidity as shown by Sébastien Vahaamahina for France in the quarter finals. I also hope we will be talking about how little we noticed the officials and not how much.I’ve had a look at four players that may be the spark to a victory for their respective teams and I’ll start with the pre-tournament and, in my eyes, still the slight favourites to win the World Cup for the third time in succession – New Zealand and the quite brilliant Beauden Barrett.I first came across Beauden when he was playing for the New Zealand sevens team in 2010. He was young and pretty green but balanced, quick and not afraid to try things. Fast forward to last weekend and one moment that was actually a botched one, to me summed up his approach to the game. The All Blacks were on the attack, had a knock-on advantage and Barrett had just slightly overrun the ball. He tried to do a back heel. He missed the ball but it revealed so much more.Not many would open themselves up to look a bit daft by trying something he knew his skills had a small chance of pulling off. He is brimming with confidence and swagger right now – as that attacking threat at the back and second receiver at the front, he is unlike anyone else in the tournament. The other three sides have not got a full-back who offers them so much in those areas. If there is one player England need to subdue for the entire match, it’s him.In their quarter-final, hosts Japan finally run aground against South Africa. Makazole Mapimpi, the Boks’ 29-year-old wing from Mdantsane, racked up his 13th try in 12 Test matches. Cheslin Kolbe normally is the headliner but Makazole is a deadly finisher. Opportunities will be few against Wales but the chance of him converting even the slimmest of those is high.The first member of his family to play rugby, he attended schools that had no history of producing players and worked his way through the levels t by scorching through defences and scoring tries. The emphasis in the semi-finals will be scoring points against miserly defences. That’s what Mapimpi does.South Africa will have to get the ball to him and players such as Faf de Klerk are going to be pivotal but when you get to this stage it’s high success rates in your kicking and high conversion rates in your attacks that count. That’s his strength. Not 90m bursts up field so much but like a running-back in the NFL, getting those crucial final yards right.They will have to get past Justin Tipuric, however, whose bottomless box of tools will give Warren Gatland’s men options in almost every area of the game. You see it not only his high tackle count and work rate in defence that gives his team a vital link in Shaun Edward’s defensive plans. It’s also Tirpuric’s attacking prowess, in which his Sevens background is definitely an advantage: he passes brilliantly and has a loping stride that often catches out a defender. He can also pick lines that get him on the edges of players to bust through or pass out of to break a defensive line. At the lineout he has been used a lot as a jumper and that is in attack and in defence.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIf he was in your fantasy football team he would be Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kevin De Bruyne and Tammy Abraham wrapped up into one. Priceless to hopes of Wales winning the World Cup.Finally it’s Owen Farrell. This is the most important game he has ever played in. Without him, England will not win the World Cup. I could have tried to be clever and picked a player from another area of the starting XV to say how important he will be but it would be all noise and no signal. Owen Farrell is that Jenga piece that you if removed on Saturday, it will all fall down.He offers something different to the other key players this weekend. He hasn’t got any real flair and you won’t see outrageous pieces of high risk skill. What you get is a pragmatic precision that puts England into the right areas and plays at the right tempo needed. His one achilles was no-arm tackles and that looks to have disappeared. He has also been accused of some hot-headed behaviour in the past but that is not here and it will be his opposite number, Richie Fou’a Mo’unga, who is the most likely to crack first. Farrell knows his tactical kicking to gain ball back or apply pressure to the New Zealander needs to be on the yen as well but he will rise to that and thrive. New Zealand have the edge but with Farrell playing at his very best that edge may slowly disappear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf0e01aa83f71b66b5eb0db739ee95d0a5a20049/37_321_1763_1058/master/1763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0297a67cb510b1002adaea734351e42b","title":"the best family theatre for christmas 2019","story":"An exciting new adventure for Tiny Tim, a penguin chick with two daddies and a furry green grouch’s plot to steal Christmas are among the jolliest shows to unwrap this festive seasonA show that celebrates the true meaning of Christmas for babies: wrapping paper.

But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined.The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at £399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm’s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.If you are unfamiliar with Apple’s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn’t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.The Series 5 builds on last year’s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.It’s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up – and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap – if you haven’t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must – the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I’ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.It’s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don’t. It’s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you’ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I’ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.Apple still leads the way on haptics – the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they’re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I’m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.It’s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there’s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called “complications”. But I’ve found there’s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can’t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they’re just bit too small. I’m being picky here, but that’s the thing about something you wear – if it’s not quite how you want it you’re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple’s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.Most Apple Watch apps aren’t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can’t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. “Hey, Siri” works fine, but activates fairly often when I don’t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn’t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It’s the same on an iPhone, more or less.There’s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it’s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It’s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There’s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that’s your jam.Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you’re not doing anything.You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular.Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple’s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven’t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you’re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that’s changed. It’s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that’s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn’t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.Then there’s the price. At £399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from £199, but doesn’t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under £300 the Series 5 has Apple’s typical premium – but it’s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.Pros: excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple PayCons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The tech firm’s rival, IBM, was swift to dismiss the excitement. Google has not, it asserts, achieved the highly prized goal of quantum supremacy.Google published its claim in the journal Nature on Wednesday after an earlier report on the work appeared briefly on a Nasa website last month. The paper describes how a team led by John Martinis, leader of the research team working on quantum supremacy, built a superconducting quantum processor named Sycamore that harnesses the weirdness of quantum physics to crunch through thorny problems.To demonstrate the device’s computational prowess, the scientists set it the deeply contrived task of checking the randomness of a sequence of numbers. What the quantum computer rattled through in three minutes and 20 seconds would keep the world’s most powerful supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee busy for 10,000 years, they claim.“To our knowledge, this experiment marks the first computation that can be performed only on a quantum processor,” the authors write. “Quantum processors have thus reached the regime of quantum supremacy.”Not so, say the IBM researchers. In a blogpost written in response to the work, they argue that the Oak Ridge supercomputer could solve the randomness problem in 2.5 days, perhaps less, depending on how it is programmed. They add that because “quantum supremacy” requires a quantum computer to solve a problem that is beyond a classical computer, Google’s claim does not hold up.“Google’s experiment is an excellent demonstration of the progress in superconducting-based quantum computing,” the IBM scientists argue. “But it should not be viewed as proof that quantum computers are ‘supreme’ over classical computers.”Standard computers and quantum computers are radically different. While standard computers perform calculations with “bits” which must be either 0 or 1, quantum computers have “qubits” that can take any value between 0 and 1. Another quirk of quantum physics allows qubits to be “entangled” such that the value of one is tied to the values of those around it. Make a quantum computer that is stable enough – a tough enough feat in itself – and it can, in principle, explore multiple solutions to a problem at once.Since the advent of the first experimental qubits, tech firms have been racing to demonstrate what the US physicist John Preskill dubbed “quantum supremacy”. Preskill coined the phrase to define the turning point in computing history when quantum computers showed their true potential by trouncing standard machines.Google’s Sycamore processor used 53 qubits to plough through the arcane task its masters gave it. According to Pichai, the breakthrough is a step towards using quantum computers to solve real world problems, such as creating new drugs, designing more efficient batteries, and making fertilisers with less energy. “We’ve already peeled away from classical computers, on to a totally different trajectory,” a Google spokesperson told the .Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland and co-founder of the quantum computing startup IonQ, said Google’s paper may be a milestone in quantum computing, but it was an academic one. “The problem is not likely to be useful for anything, except showing something that appears to be really hard using normal computers,” he said.But work towards useful quantum computers was “marching along” Monroe added, saying the devices were likely to help solve a raft of problems from logistics to understanding the structures of large molecules. “Problems like this can only be solved on a quantum computer,” he said.Steve Brierley, CEO of the Cambridge-based quantum software company, Riverlane, said: “It’s clearly an amazing achievement. I think this is going to be one of those moments when people look back and say that was the time that really changed this field of quantum computing. It is also a great moment in time to stop talking about quantum supremacy, which has unfortunate historical connotations, and move on to talking about quantum advantage that has a useful application.”In an accompanying article in Nature, William Oliver, a physicist at MIT, compares Google’s achievement to the first flights of the Wright brothers. The Wright Flyer was not the first airborne vehicle to fly, nor did it solve any pressing problem, but it demonstrated a radical new possibility, the implications of which became clear only decades later. “It is what the event represented, rather than what it practically accomplished, that was paramount.

Zuckerberg danced around an answer, saying the company does not collect data on race specifically and that it is carrying out a large-scale civil rights audit on its policies.“It’s always been against our policies for anyone to use the ad systems to discriminate, and we enforce those policies through a mix of technical systems and human review,” Zuckerberg said. Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman of California criticized Zuckerberg’s claims that Libra will help poor and unbanked people around the world enter the financial system. “The poor and unbanked need pesos, they need dollars that they can buy something at a local store,” he said. “You’ve done no effort to help the unbanked anywhere else and any other time.”He said an anonymous currency is more likely to help drug dealers and other people seeking to circumvent traditional financial systems more than the poor and unbanked. “For the richest man in the world to come here and hide behind the poorest people in the world, and say that’s who you’re really trying to help,” he said. “You’re trying to help those for whom the dollar is not a good currency – drug dealers and tax evaders.”The hearings are quickly winding into topics outside of cryptocurrency. Representative Bill Posey of Florida uses his time on the floor to ask Zuckerberg why Facebook cracks down on anti-vaccine content, seeming to support the theory – for which there is no scientific backing – that vaccines cause disabilities.“I support vaccinations of children and adults, but I also support open and frank communication of the risk of vaccination,” he said. Zuckerberg does not seem to know how to respond to a congressman supporting anti-vaccination groups. “We try to focus on on misinformation that has the potential to lead to physical harm or imminent harm,” Zuckerberg says. “And that can include, especially misleading health advice.”Congressman Gregory Meeks of New York questions Facebook’s commitment to the unbanked and underbanked in a heated exchange.“Facebook is a multibillion, trillion-dollar company,” he said. “You say you are concerned about the underbanked unbanked - how much of Facebook money is in minority depository institutions?”Zuckerberg responded saying Facebook is in “every country in the world except North Korea and China” and thus “we would be in almost every country where different activities are happening.” He did not address minority owned financial institutions specifically. Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez of New York asks Zuckerberg if he agrees to a full moratorium on Libra pending congressional approval. “Facebook’s slogan for a long time was ‘move fast, break things.’ Mr Zuckerberg – we do not want to break the International Monetary System,” she said.Zuckerberg declines to commit to the moratorium.Congresswoman Ann Wagner of Missouri asks Zuckerberg why major players have departed from the Libra Association in recent weeks. Wagner said she finds the partners’ departures “highly concerning,” and that she questions whether he is “up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards”.“Because it’s a it’s a risky project and there’s been a lot of scrutiny,” Zuckerberg said of the departures.McHenry asks Zuckerberg why he chose to base the Libra Association in Switzerland, a diplomatically neutral location, if he plans to comply with US regulation. “We were trying to set up a global payment system,” Zuckerberg said. “Switzerland is where a lot of the international organizations are. Switzerland has certainly been forward-leaning on wanting to work through systems like this, but one of the things I want to be clear on is that the Libra Association is independent and we do not control it.”Republican congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina has the floor now, asking Zuckerberg when his views on China became more adversarial, after the CEO implied he wants to beat the country to the field by launching Libra. “My views have evolved,” Zuckerberg said. “I was more optimistic, but now I’m realizing China has some problems, which is why we worked with Beijing bringing fiber optic undersea cables from China to LA along with Google.”House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters grills Zuckerberg on the company’s decision not to remove false advertisements from politicians. “From a business perspective, the very small percent of our business that is made up of political ads does not come anywhere close to justifying the controversy that this incurs for our company,” Zuckerberg said. “So this really is not about money. This is on principle, I believe in giving people a voice. I believe that ads can be an important part of voice.”Mark Zuckerberg reads his opening statements, arguing in favor of American innovation and saying if the US does not allow the launch of a cryptocurrency, China will beat it to the field. “China is moving quickly the launch of similar idea in the coming months,” he said. “Libra is going to be backed mostly by dollars, and I believe that it will extend America’s financial leadership around the world, as well as our democratic values and an oversight. But if America doesn’t innovate, our financial leadership is not guaranteed.”Waters criticizes Facebook’s failures to comply with existing ersity and security framework, ultimately questioning whether action should be taken against the company to stop it. She said Facebook failed to release its ersity statistics in the past, and that it was sued by the National Fair Housing Alliance for enabling advertisers to engage in discrimination through algorithms on the platform.Maxine Waters hits the ground running, listing to Zuckerberg the litany of concerns she and other Congress members have regarding Libra. Plans to create a digital currency have caused many concerns “relating to privacy, trading risks, national security, monetary policy, and the stability of the global financial system,” she said.“I and other Democrats have called for a moratorium on Facebook’s development of this digital currency Libra and digital wallet Libra until Congress can examine the issues associated with a big tech company developing these digital products, and take action,” she said. Good morning, Kari Paul in San Francisco here, covering today’s hearing, An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors.The hearing will start with opening statements from Representative Maxine Waters, more details to come.

How has this implicitly racist idea made it to our screens in 2019? I often think, when something new is delivered to our screens, of all the forces that have had to combine over the weeks, months, sometimes years to get it there. From the first stirrings in a dramatist’s mind or the first steps of a documentary maker nosing out a story, and on through the eternally mysterious journey of creation, their ideas are gradually forming until arriving, finally, at the last stage of fruition – the bureaucratic hoops through which all must jump. Commissioners to entice and enthuse, lawyers to please, notes to take in, paperwork to fill out, the long chain of decisionmakers to be appeased, satisfied and made comfortable, until finally the show is given a slot and aired to the masses.This, at least, is what I presume happens. But then programmes such as The British Tribe Next Door turn up and suddenly all certainties are gone, exploded into nothingness by a series – not even a one-off – that sends a suburban British family to live next door to a group of indigenous people in the Namibian desert to see what cultural hijinks ensue. And it is happening here, on Channel 4, in essence a public service broadcaster, and now, in the year of our Lord 2019.It is … exactly as it sounds. The suburban family are the Moffatts, the County Durhamites from Gogglebox, who are perfectly pleasant, inoffensive people distinguished mainly by their eldest daughter, Scarlett, who has both a sense of humour and the rare and charming ability to put her thoughts into TV-friendly words as she is having them. They are taken to Namibia – younger daughter Ava-Grace barely lifting her head from her phone no matter how many breathtaking herds of wildlife pass their jeep – to live for a month with the semi-nomadic Himba people in Otjeme. You might not have expected the programme makers to take the gimmickry this far, by building an exact replica of the Moffatt house there, but other than that there is nothing you would not have suspected.The Himba women who visit the house are staggered, and possibly appalled, by the 20,000 Moffattian possessions it contains (“Why do you need so many things for one person?” one asks, gazing round Scarlett’s cushion-covered, shoe-stuffed bedroom), fascinated and seemingly envious of the dishwasher and washing machine and baffled by the amount of housework that matriarch Betty still finds to do. The men reckon termites will take the lot in a few months.There are some truly fascinating moments that reveal (to the uninitiated in the ways of semi-nomadic tribes in the Namibian desert, among whom I count myself) unsuspected depths to the cultural chasm. The first women to visit the house are perturbed by the idea of having a second floor and then absolutely flummoxed by stairs – “Are we climbing? Will we fall?” – and intrigued by the hall mirror. “I thought there was someone on the other side. It’s like water on the wall.”But it is not enough to justify a series. And even less so a series that – despite what I’m generously going to assume were best efforts in the other direction – fails to avoid putting the tribe in the service of providing teachable moments to the Moffatts – and Scarlett in particular. The reaction in the mirror becomes the story of Scarlett’s insecurities about her body, as does the tribespeople’s desire that she wear their traditional dress.None of this is the Moffatts’ fault. Scarlett’s unfiltered responses serve her well (“I don’t want to offend them,” she says on her way back to the house after a failed attempt to explain why she is not happy about wearing the topless dress, “or make them think I don’t appreciate what they’ve done, because I do …”) but the makers have put them in what seems to me to be an implicitly racist format, working within a tradition that has historically not treated indigenous people well or respectfully, even if there is nothing overtly racist about this specific instance. At the very best, you could say it is a massively flawed premise executed as well as you could hope. At worst, you could say very, very differently. But apparently nobody, at any point in that long, long line of folk responsible between concept and fruition, did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c2aed00bdb51f8261a48e1c9dfab64ca5c4b15/263_460_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97c9576f36363035c1dc65460b05a695","title":"chinese cafe featuring dogs dyed to look like pandas facing backlash","story":"‘I suggest dyeing cafe owner black and white,’ says one critic over stunt in Chengdu A cafe in China featuring chow chow dogs painted as panda cubs has prompted widespread criticism over the treatment of the pets.The Cute Pet Games cafe opened last month in Chengdu in the south-west Sichuan province, home to a large proportion of the endangered bear species, featuring six fluffy chow chows dyed white and black.A video of the dogs roaming around the cafe has gone viral on Chinese social media. In the video, posted by Chengdu Economic Daily, the owner of the cafe said it was also offering a dyeing service for 1,500 yuan (£165) to patrons who wished to give their pets a similar makeover.Internet users criticised the cafe’s treatment of the dogs, which were purchased already dyed, according to the owner. “In the name of loving animals, these pet cafes just want to make money,” one said. Another said: “I suggest dyeing the dog owners black and white.”Some pointed to comments by vets that dyeing a dog can damage its skin. “Dogs are dogs. Dyeing them doesn’t turn them into pandas, and they are living beings. You … hurt them just for the sake of what you think looks good.”Others, calling the animals “panda dogs”, defended the cafe owner’s right to change the pets’ appearance. “It’s your dog. You get to decide. Very cute,” one said.Following the online response, the cafe said on its Weibo page that it would not continue to offer the dyeing service. “Chengdu is the home of pandas. We wanted to do something different, to differentiate us from other regular dog cafes and pet shops,” the owner of the cafe, surnamed Huang, told local media.In a statement posted on Weibo on Tuesday, the cafe said: “As their owners, their lives are much better than ours.

At least nine people died and more than 200 were injured due to riots in Jakarta following the fraught campaign, during which Subianto accused Widodo’s government of hosting a “massive, systematic and fraudulent” election.News of Subianto’s expected appointment has caused unrest among many Widodo supporters. Public unease over Subianto wielding power over the armed forces derives from his previous military record. A former son-in-law of the late Indonesian dictator Suharto, Subianto was accused of orchestrating the kidnapping and torture of activists ahead of anti-government demonstrations in 1998 when he was an army commander. He has never been charged in relation to the alleged incidents.Ahead of Subianto’s appointment, Usman Hamid, Amnesty International’s Indonesia executive, said “it would be a dark day for human rights in this country” if he got the defence job.The election campaign fought between Subianto and Widodo was marred by a flood of misinformation. However since the result was announced the pair have appeared together in public, with Subianto saying on Monday that his party, Gerindra, was “ready to help if asked” to bolster the cabinet of the president’s coalition government.When Subianto’s defence minister position was officially announced Widodo said: “I believe I don’t have to tell him about his job – he knows more than I do.”Elsewhere in the cabinet Widodo focused on appointing professionals rather than political party members. Nadiem Makarim, co-founder of ride-hailing company Gojek, was made education and culture minister. Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the former World Bank managing director, was reappointed finance minister.As his second term begins, Widodo, 58, faces many challenges beyond his main stated goal of improving the nation’s economy. This month a suspected Isis radical attacked his chief security minister and violence broke out in Papua as protestors marched against alleged abuses by officials and demanded Papuan independence.Widodo has also faced a public backlash over a proposed draconian penal code amendment that would criminalise publicly criticising the Indonesian government and court system. The move has been branded undemocratic by law experts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c0dbb9f9d58324b6b795fcd5365c9c20695720d/0_15_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d532b4b922c6b42c7dac7d77255af6db","title":"kim jong un orders razing of souths unpleasant mount kumgang buildings","story":"North Korean ruler demands makeover of joint resort, saying South Korean facilities are like ‘temporary buildings at construction sites’Kim Jong-un has ordered the demolition of “unpleasant-looking” South Korean facilities at the Mount Kumgang resort – a rare symbol of inter-Korean collaboration – and called for them to be replaced with “modern” buildings constructed by the North.The North’s ruler said it was a “mistake” for the resort, on the east coast, to be regarded as the common property of two Koreas given its location on North Korean soil, according to the state news agency KCNA.“Mount Kumgang is our land won at the cost of blood and even a cliff and a tree on it are associated with our sovereignty and dignity,” Kim said during a visit to the resort this week, KCNA reported, adding that he thought South Korean facilities were “reminiscent of temporary buildings at construction sites”.South Koreans began tours to Mount Kumgang in 1998 but suspended them in 2008 when a female tourist from the South was shot dead by a North Korean soldier for reportedly wandering into a military zone.The resort, built with investment from South Korean firms, has since hosted occasional reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean war.Pyongyang is reported to have been angered by South Korea’s failure to resume the tours, amid stalled negotiations over Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programmesThe regime has pushed Seoul to ignore US objections to greater inter-Korean cooperation, but any South Korean investment in Kumgang would violate international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.Kumgang, along with the now-closed Kaesong industrial complex just north of the countries’ heavily armed border, was once seen as an example of what they could achieve despite military and political tensions.The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has raised the prospect of resuming tours to Kumgang in an attempt to restart inter-Korean cooperation.During their summit in Pyongyang in September 2018, Moon and Kim agreed to resume tours to Kumgang and reopen Kaesong “as soon as the environment is created”. In April this year, Donald Trump described Kumgang as an “unbelievable location” but said the time was “not right” to allow South Koreans to visit.Despite his criticism of South Korean architecture, Kim said: “We will always welcome our compatriots from the South if they want to come to Mount Kumgang after it is wonderfully built as the world-level tourist destination.”Kim also criticised his “predecessors” – believed to be a veiled reference to his father, Kim Jong-il – for encouraging the South to invest in Kumgang. “He made a sharp criticism of the very wrong, dependent policy of the predecessors who were going to rely on others when the country was not strong enough,” KCNA said.The North Korean leader is promoting tourism as a key component of his policy of “self-reliant” economic growth. An editorial in the state-run newspaper Rodong Sinmun said: “The entire people should cherish the belief that self-reliance is the only way to live. There is nothing more foolish than to expect help from others today.”Kim’s pitch for self-reliance came as the UN warned that food insecurity in North Korea was at an “alarming level”, with nearly 11 million people undernourished. Tomas Ojea Quintana, the UN’s independent investigator on human rights in North Korea said an estimated 140,000 children were suffering from “undernutrition”, including 30,000 who “face an increased risk of death”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cba7d3e9e8ddca397852cea86bc9b449fb72b42/0_262_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae75ec516b9864a3871bb29ee027d3d1","title":"russia steps up presence north east syria after turkey deal","story":"More Russian troops arrive in border region as Donald Trump hails situation as a ‘big success’Russian troops have expanded their presence across north-eastern Syria, the result of an agreement between Ankara and Moscow that should end Turkey’s attack on Kurdish-led forces at the price of ending the Kurds’ dreams of local autonomy.Syrian and Russian media showed footage of Russian military police vehicles on the outskirts of the important towns of Manbij and Kobane on Wednesday, one day after the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, met Vladimir Putin in Sochi.A statement carried on Russia’s Interfax agency said Russian patrols had already begun inside Manbij, a town that until two weeks ago was a key US base in the region.The deal was hailed as a “big success” by Donald Trump, although his critics say it cements Russia’s role as prime power broker in the Middle East after the US president’s announcement that American special forces would withdraw from the area.Until Turkey launched its offensive\u0026nbspthere on 9 October, the region was controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which comprises militia groups representing a range of ethnicities, though its backbone is Kurdish.\u0026nbspSince the Turkish incursion, the SDF has lost much of its territory and appears to be losing its grip on key cities. On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.On 17 October Turkish president,\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, agreed with US vice-president Mike Pence, to suspend Ankara’s operation for\u0026nbsp five days in order to allow Kurdish troops to withdraw. The following week, on 22 October, Erdoğan and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin agreed on the parameters of the proposed Turkish “safe zone” in Syria.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobane, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.Turkish troops, allied Syrian rebel proxies, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and soldiers belonging to the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, are now all present in the border zone, with Russia the only negotiating force between them.The talks on Tuesday between Erdoğan and the Russian president defined the contours of Turkey’s long-proposed border “safe zone”: Turkish troops in the area seized since the offensive began on 9 October will remain in situ, and Russian soldiers and the Syrian army will control the rest of the frontier.Moscow and Damascus will supervise the removal of Kurdish fighters and weaponry to the depth of 18 miles (29km) from their current positions on the border before 26 October, after which joint Russian-Turkish patrols will begin across the entire border area to a depth of six miles, with the exception of the de facto Kurdish capital, Qamishli.On Wednesday, the Russian ministry of defence published a map showing 15 planned border observation posts that will be manned by the Syrian regime.The deal in effect redraws the map of northern Syria and ends five years of semi-autonomy carved out by the local Kurdish administration and its military forces, after Kurdish officials reached an agreement with Assad, their former enemy, for military reinforcements to fend off the Turkish attack.However, the fate of local military councils set up by the SDF in border towns previously under their control and what happens to the SDF’s non-Kurdish units remains unclear. The SDF and Kurdish politicians are yet to comment on the Sochi deal.It is believed they will retain control of the approximately 90,000 men, women and children with links to Islamic State being held in Kurdish-run prisons and detention camps.Turkish officials including Erdoğan threatened on Wednesday that Ankara would resume the offensive if neither Russia nor the US guaranteed the total withdrawal of Kurdish fighters from the border region.Erdoğan asked Putin what would happen if the People’s Protection Units (YPG), the largest and most important unit within the SDF, put on Syrian army uniforms in order to stay in the border area, according to Hürriyet newspaper.Ankara says the YPG is indistinguishable from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state for decades. Erdoğan said Putin responded by saying he would not let that happen.The border towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, which have experienced fierce fighting, remained quiet on Wednesday, one day after a separate, poorly observed US-brokered ceasefire expired.Trump tweeted: “Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured.”Erdoğan is scheduled to visit the White House next month.The deal was greeted more cautiously by the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who said the need for a political solution in north-east Syria would be discussed by defence ministers in Brussels on Thursday.At least 120 Syrians have died and 176,000 people have fled their homes over the last two weeks of violence, with 20 Turkish civilian deaths on the other side of the border."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8f6e2839f90aa29229d2cfa92007c4863303e4a/0_201_2740_1645/master/2740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee6a3b3f8dfd2987a4d9d2bafd9ab2ae","title":"sailing ships cleaning up sea transport oceans","story":"Ethically minded entrepreneurs are turning back the clock to sweep the scourge of bunker fuel from the oceansThey fan out across the seas like a giant maritime dance, a ballet of tens of thousands of vessels delivering the physical stuff that has become indispensable to our way of life: commodities and cars, white goods and gas and grains, timber and technology.But shipping – a vast industry that moves trillions of pounds-worth of goods each year – is facing an environmental reckoning.

He wondered if it would be possible to transport things such as coffee and chocolate with zero emissions. Then he remembered that this was how goods used to travel. By sailing ship.A quick online search revealed that a Dutch company was doing exactly that.The owners of Fairtransport were inspired to revive sail cargo after witnessing at first hand the yellow smog caused by commercial vessels. They restored two ships, a 70-year-old minesweeper renamed the Tres Hombres and a wooden ketch called Nordlys that dates back to 1873.Templeman arranged to board the Tres Hombres, sailing from the Azores to the Netherlands. “I was watching the ocean and it came like a ghost ship through the dawn mist. It looked like a pirate vessel. I was so excited.”He dreamed of launching his own ship but realised that the first step was to make full use of the sailing vessels already in service.He set up as a broker and together with his business partner, Will Adeney, went in pursuit of products to sell. They found their perfect olive oil in Portugal and arranged to have it shipped to Devon on board the Nordlys. They later sourced coffee beans in Colombia, and shipped them to Europe on the Tres Hombres. Their business, Shipped by Sail, was born.It joined a growing network of brokers and sailors passionate about transporting goods by wind power. The next step: to boost demand for this kind of transportation.“Consumers already understand organic produce and fair trade, and the next step is clean transport,” says Cornelius Bockermann, who founded Timbercoast, a German sail cargo company that has restored a schooner from 1920, and is now refitting a second.Clean transport is the missing link, as many so-called sustainable or ethical goods are currently carried on ships that pollute the air and sea. The perfect example of this is plant-based meat, shipped around the world from California.British couple Marcus and Freya Pomeroy-Rowden built their ship, the Grayhound, as a replica of an 18th-century lugger, and carry cargo between the UK and France, bringing West Country ale to Brittany and French wine to Cornwall. They supply small businesses along the way, for example providing wines to Dibble \u0026amp Grub on the Isles of Scilly. The couple enjoy the lifestyle of spending months at sea, making a living, while making a difference.Marcus says they’re bringing trade back to a human scale. “We’re taking quality products and transporting them direct to a distributor. We can understand and explain the whole chain for our products, from manufacture to the table.”In France, TransOceanic Wind Transport has developed a labelling system with a voyage number, allowing the customer to see how products reached them.Broker Alex Geldenhuys launched New Dawn Traders in the UK about six years ago and is still developing her “voyage co-op” model, bringing together farmers, ships and buyers.Geldenhuys has been inspired by local food communities and vegetable box schemes and wants to extend that movement overseas, building relationships with distant farmers to bring ethically produced, high-quality produce to the UK with a carbon footprint that is close to zero. She is seeking “port allies” to promote the idea in coastal communities, encouraging customers to pre-order products from the ships and turning collection events at the docks into celebrations of the whole process.A few weeks ago a French schooner, De Gallant, sailed into Bristol laden with produce from Portugal the first time a tall ship had brought cargo to the city for decades. It was an emotional moment for Geldenhuys and the climax of years of work.“It was beautiful to watch her sailing in under the suspension bridge,” she says. Local people milled around the ship, sampling olive oil, almonds and wines.Geldenhuys acknowledges that currently she can only deliver to her customers twice a year. Templeman says: “Restaurants and other businesses need a regular supply to be reliable. So we’re warehousing goods.” Olive oil on De Gallant was transported by electric van to a restaurant in Bristol.The biggest challenge for sail cargo is scale. There are currently only a few small ships operating. Most companies feel that the time is ripe for expansion and have plans to build larger vessels. One of the founders of Fairtransport, Jorne Langelaan, has set up a new venture called EcoClipper to facilitate emission-free shipping worldwide. He is planning for more sailing ships running more routes more frequently.In Costa Rica, Canadian Danielle Doggett is building a sailing ship called Ceiba, which looks set to become the largest in the world. The project uses tropical trees that have fallen in storms, and more trees are planted as the building proceeds.Ceiba will be able to carry 250 tonnes of cargo (Tres Hombres and De Gallant take 35 tonnes), which is equivalent to around 10 containers. Yet this is still much smaller than the historic tea clippers, such as the Cutty Sark, and dwarfed by the largest modern container ships, which can carry more than 20,000.The shipping industry knows that change is on the horizon. From next year new regulations will further limit sulphur oxide emissions from ships. The International Maritime Organization has announced its ambition to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The world’s largest shipping company, Maersk, has gone further, pledging to be carbon-neutral by 2050.Templeman acknowledges that the largest companies want to make their fleets more energy-efficient, but points out: “We’re coming from the opposite direction and offering emission-free shipping right now, while asking what sail shipping could have been with another 100 years of development.”Marcus Pomeroy-Rowden adds: “We’re waving a flag to say the world can’t carry on as it is. We’re also showing what can be done in a different way.”Bockermann stresses that industrial shipping is only cheap because it externalises the environmental costs. “What you normally pay a shipping company doesn’t account for the damage to the environment, pollution or health. Our costs are comparatively high but if you had to pay for the damage of conventional shipping then we wouldn’t seem expensive.”Geldenhuys adds: “We might not be the solution to how everything is shipped in the world but we can make people think about what they’re buying and how it’s getting here. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. But we can all do something. We don’t need one solution to everything, we need a thousand solutions that can exist simultaneously.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Photograph: iStockOur family has been based abroad for several years, but my daughter is keen to go to college in Ireland. She is sitting the US college-based AP program this year. Can you advise how this translates in to applying to the Irish university system? In Ireland we have a Central Application Operations (CAO) system through which potential students nominate their college courses of choice.Following the opening of the college application process on 5th November next, your daughter should register with the CAO (cao.ie) and submit her application.Over the coming months she should research all the courses offered through the Irish third level system. Qualifax (qualifax.ie) is a good start. The site is easy to navigate and she should be able identify programmes that meet her needs, both in terms of content and progression opportunities. I would advise her to study every programme in some depth to ensure she is familiar with all aspects of its delivery.She can complete her initial list of course choices on her CAO online application by 1st February next. She will have an opportunity to amend those choices up to 1st July next during the months of May and June next.When her application is being considered by each college, she will be offered the highest course on each of the two lists for which heshe secures the necessary grades in whichever terminal exam she completes.As your daughter is taking the US college-based AP programme, she should tick the ‘other school leaving exams’ box in the qualifications \u0026amp assessments summary section of the online application form. She must then provide details of her school leaving exams and the years they were completed. Make sure she describes the examinations briefly and submit certified A4 photocopies of any certificates, with translations if the certificate is not in English, to CAO, Tower House, Eglinton Street, Galway, Ireland.If she is sitting their examinations in 2020, she must submit certified photocopies of their results to CAO as soon as they become available.If she has any queries about how her application will be assessed, she must contact the admissions office of any college for which she has listed a course. There is no uniformity in how Irish third level institutions treat applications from other jurisdictions and nationalities.In the case of some colleges, they may require the applicant to submit applications directly to the admissions office of the institution in question as well as or instead of to the CAO. Therefore, it is vitally important that your daughter not only identifies each course for which she wishes to be considered, but also checks with that colleges admissions office that she fulfils all their application requirement for her unique circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Roots of mature lime trees had caused damage to narrow footpath in GlasnevinDubliner (68) pleaded guilty to knowingly possessing 901 images and 146 video filesCourt told woman had \u0026lsquofixed, false and psychotic view\u0026rsquo of her child\u0026rsquos autistic conditionDublin area water is typically disinfected with ozone, chlorine or ultra-violet lightTarget of west Dublin attack was shot a number of times but survivedControversial Shannon LNG project would facilitate importation of fracked gas from USHealth committee told all new consultants should be given Sl\u0026aacuteintecare contractsAuthority publishes long list of dos and don\u0026rsquots including considering paper platesDanger of infection by cryptosporidium and other bacteria for 600,000 peopleWhat was Collins\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquofreedom to achieve freedom\u0026rsquo speech all about?Judge directed jury at Belfast court to find her not guilty after reform of region\u0026rsquos lawsWorkers informed of restructuring plans during meeting at Ringaskiddy campusOver 20,000 runners from across 50 different countries taking part in Sunday\u0026rsquos raceTwo men and a woman arrested after assault and false imprisonment of a 19-year-old manOireachtas committee to hear proposals could cost \u0026euro650m per yearRegina Doherty announces \u0026euro150,000 in funding for establishment of judge-led groupTaoiseach makes remark in State apology to women affected by CervicalCheck scandalLeo Varadkar\u0026rsquos apology was welcome but there are many details about the scandal that are still unclear"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4059480.1571771831!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"boil water notice for dublin kildare and meath to affect 600 000 people","story":"A boil water notice was issued by Irish Water on Tuesday evening affecting more than half a million people in parts of Dublin, Co Kildare and Co Meath.Roughly 600,000 live in the areas of Fingal, Dublin City Council, South Dublin County Council parts of Kildare and in Dunboyne, Co Meath which are affected by the notice.The warning follows issues with a water treatment plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, which may have compromised the disinfection process which makes the water safe to drink.Irish Water said the notice was issued to protect the health of customers on a precautionary measure and came into immediate effect.It said the issues have now been resolved, but affected water is still travelling through the system.A spokeswoman said the notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that updates will be available on its website and on social media.

Photogrpah:  John AllenProvisionTrade union and business leaders have reacted with dismay to the news that pharmaceutical giant Novartis is to lay off up to 320 of its 550 strong workforce in Co Cork as part of a global restructuring.Workers at the Ringaskiddy campus, which comprises both an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient manufacturing unit and a Global Service Centre involved in procurement, were called to a meeting at the plant on Wednesday morning.Novartis Ringaskiddy Ltd Managing Director, Shane Relihan broke to the news to staff that the company was seeking 240 redundancies in the API plant and a further 80 in the Global Service Centre.Mr Relihan said that the redundancies will start to take effect from mid 2020 with 80 redundancies at the Global Service Centre expected to be completed by the end of 2021.The redundancies at the Global Service Centre, which currently employs 180 people, will result from the relocation of a number of global service roles from Ringaskiddy to centralised operations centres in Europe and Asia.Meanwhile, the 240 redundancies at the API plant will stem from the decision to consolidate its API manufacturing operations at the campus, resulting in the closure of one of its production buildings by mid-2022.Novartis, which was formed through the merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy, manufactures drugs for hypertension and cardiac problems at the Ringaskiddy plant which has benefitted from €850 million in investment over the years.The Cork plant is one of 60 sites worldwide within Novartis Technical Operations ision and the company is currently carrying out a review with a focus on centralisation to optimise capacity and lower costs through simplification.Mr Relihan said it was important to stress the decision to seek the Ringaskiddy lay-offs was not a reflection of the performance of the workforce who have worked hard over the past 25 years to supply customers and patients.“Novartis will work closely with our employees and representative groups to support everyone during this period ahead, providing severance packages and outplacement services.“We will also work with our industry partners across the pharmaceutical industry cluster here in Cork to identify future employment opportunities in the area,” said Mr Relihan.Most workers declined to speak to the media as they left the plant following the briefing.‘Bit of a shock’However, one employee, Joe Barry from Glanmire said that news of the layoffs came as a shock to most staff at the plant.“I just got a text yesterday to day there was bad news being announced - we knew there were changes coming down the line and things were changing in there but it was still a bit of a shock,” he said.“It’s kind of a global thing - it’s the way the API pharmaceutical companies are going really - it’s all about smaller volumes and contract out the work because they say it’s cheaper to do it somewhere else.”Mr Barry said the workforce knew that Novartis had been trying to sell the plant but many felt the decision by the company to recently invest in the Ringaskiddy campus had led many to assume everything was secure.“I suppose it’s like factories down the years, Fords, Dunlops, gone with a swipe of a pen - we still have to see how it pans out - there are a lot of companies around the place recruiting so hopefully people will pick up something.“But the age demographic may have something to do with that - we have an older demographic- a lot of fellows are here 25 years or more but maybe we might have a corporate change of policy, you have to look on the bright side.”Siptu pharmaceutical sector organiser in Cork Alan O’Leary said the union was aware that Novartis was carrying out a review of its manufacturing operations including the fact it was seeking to sell the Ringaskiddy plant.“We were formally told that the company was potentially selling the site and selling a manufacturing API plant can take time - it can take three or four or five years, so people never thought there was anything imminent.”Mr O’Leary said that while Novartis was saying that the decision would have no immediate impact, it was creating huge uncertainty for workers - we are hoping to work with the company to try and minimise the cuts obviously.”Major playerMr O’Leary said Siptu, which represents 300 staff at the campus, would focus first on saving the jobs but if there are to be redundancies, the union would then work to ensure they were on a voluntary basis.Cork Chamber chief executive Conor Healy expressed disappointment at the news, saying Novartis had been a major employer in Ringaskiddy for over 25 years and a major player in helping Cork establish a reputation as a major pharma centre.“Our immediate thoughts are with the impacted employees and their families and we encourage the State agencies to work with Novartis and the employees to ensure that all available reemployment opportunities are identifiedTánaiste and local Cork South Central Fine Gael TD Simon Coveney said the announcement was a “significant blow” and would be “very difficult for the highly skilled workers” and their families.“I’ve spoken to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys, as well as the IDA to ensure all available supports from state agencies are now open to the staff affected by this Novartis announcement,” he said.“The staff are highly skilled in the competitive pharmaceutical industry and the state agencies will use the 3-year timeline laid out by Novartis to work with the company and the workers to protect employment.”Fianna Fáil leader and fellow Cork South Central TD, Micheál Martin said that Novartis had become one of the biggest employers in Ringaskiddy since the 1990s and the jobs cut announcement was “devastating” for the region.“The job losses are particularly disappointing as Novartis in Cork was high-end manufacturing and I hope all efforts are made by government and the IDA to prevent as many job losses as possible,” he said.“Every effort should be made to relocate those that lose jobs and to seek an alternative company to invest. Extra efforts have to be made in the far more competitive environment globally.”“It is important now, that management engage with staff to outline a clear picture for those who face into these jobs losses and that supports from the organisation and the government are provided immediately.”Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Heather Humphreys said she was shocked by the news and said her department had received no notification of the announcement despite being in close contact with all multinationals.“We didn’t have any notice of this ..... sometimes decisions are made in boardrooms, not in Ireland and these decisions have an impact on Ireland and on the jobs here. Ultimately this is a decision for the company.”Ms Humphreys said she was “extremely disappointed”, particularly following so soon after the news from Molex in Shannon in Co Clare that it is to close with the loss of over 500 jobs.“The reality is that Ireland is a very open export-orientated economy, and we are operating in a competitive global market and this can sometimes mean that decisions taken by firms abroad can impact on their operations here.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060051.1571829163!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish water to meet hse as dublin boil water notice remains in place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA boil water notice is in place for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area.Irish Water and the HSE will review the drinking-water situation for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area at a meeting\u0026nbspon Wednesday.On Tuesday, Irish Water issued its largest ever boil water notice alongside a map showing the areas affected. The danger of infection includes cryptosporidium poisoning, which can severely impact health, particularly among those with vulnerable health issues.According to Irish Water, the initial problem that compromised the disinfectant process at a water-treatment plant in Leixlip, Co Kildare, has been repaired.However, the utility said untreated water probably remained in some 20 per cent of supplies in south, west and north Dublin as well as parts of Co Kildare and Co Meath.Irish Water warned there may be “residual” untreated water in the network for several days, as treated water flushes the system.Boil-water notices remain in place, and it is understood the duration of these will be discussed at this morning’s meeting.A spokeswoman said the boil notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that Irish Water will be continually testing the the supply and liaising with the HSE.Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.The spokesman said more information will be released throughout the day as it becomes availableThe HSE, in a statement on Wednesday morning, said it was informed\u0026nbsp on Tuesday by Irish Water of issues at their Leixlip Water Treatment Plant.“As a result of these issues drinking water produced at the water treatment plant may contain cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia. These may cause gastrointestinal infections with symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. People who develop such symptoms should consult their general practitioners for testing and treatment,” it said.Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a microscopic parasite (Cryptosporidium). Once an animal or person is infected, the parasite lives in the intestine and passes in the stool.Giardiasis is a form of gastroenteritis, characterised by diarrhoeal illness that is caused by a microscopic parasite, Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is a notifiable disease in Ireland.‘Disastrous’Irish Water has meanwhile opened a second investigation into the “disastrous” crashing of its website at a time when it should have been warning more than half a million people that their drinking water was polluted.The utility has blamed an “underlying problem” for the site - which it directs customers to if supplies are contaminated - being unavailable for several hours on Tuesday evening.Yvonne Harris, customer strategy manager with Irish Water, said the website only “recovered” at 11pm. It crashed after a warning was issued shortly after 5pm that around 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area were at risk from their own drinking water.“The timing was really disastrous from an Irish Water perspective,” she said. “Typically when we send out alerts we would direct people to our website. The fact that the website wasn’t available yesterday evening was inconvenient again.”CautionProblems were detected at around 11am on Tuesday. After hours of testing by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Health Service Executive, a decision was eventually taken at 4.40pm to issue a boil-water notice to hundreds of thousands of homes.Ms Harris said a “small mechanical failure” at “one of the older elements” of its Leixlip plant caused the pollution.“There may be bugs in the water that would cause a health issue for customers,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Ms Harris acknowledged confusion among customers about the exact areas impacted, and she urged people to “err on the side of caution”.“If it appears from our website and the maps that you might have seen on social media that you are affected, please boil your water. We would ask customers to err on the side of caution.”Irish Water said water must be boiled for drinking drinks made with water preparation of salads and similar foods, which are not cooked prior to eating brushing teeth and making ice cubes.It said caution should be taken when bathing children to ensure they do not swallow the bathing water.For the preparation of infant feeds with water, it advises the use of water that has been brought to the boil once and cooled.

Photograph: EPANEIL HALLOwen Paterson became the latest Tory Eurosceptic MP to invoke the name of an Irish nationalist politician during the protracted Brexit debates in the House of Commons.Mr Paterson, a former secretary of state for Northern Ireland, referenced Michael Collins in a speech in which he signalled his reluctant support for British prime minister Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB), having previously voted against Theresa May’s Bill three times.Last month the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg invoked the name of Charles Stewart Parnell in a debate in the chamber.The Collins speech that Mr Paterson referred to was made in Dáil Éireann on December 19th, 1921, during the Treaty debates.Thirteen days prior to the debate Collins had been one of signatories of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that established the Irish Free State and the independent Irish State as it is today.The treaty gave Ireland the same dominion status as Canada and Australia, although it stopped short of the Irish Republic that the IRA had fought for in the War of Independence.The terms of the Treaty included an oath of allegiance to the British monarch, the presence of a governor-general on his behalf and the retention by Britain of the Treaty ports of Berehaven, Queenstown (Cobh) and Lough Swilly.This was anathema to many Republicans who would eventually take the anti-Treaty side in the Civil War.The Treaty delegation comprising Arthur Griffith (chairman), Collins, George Gavan Duffy, Eamonn Duggan and Robert Barton signed the Treaty without referring it back to the President of Dáil Éireann Éamon de Valera who famously did not attend the negotiations.Collins defended his decision by stating the letters approved by Dáil were explicit that they the delegations were “envoys plenipotenary from the elected government of the Republic of Ireland”.A plenipotenary is described as a person, especially a diplomat, invested with the full power of independent action on behalf of the government.In his famous speech to the Dáil, Collins stated the British prime minister David Lloyd-George had made it clear that an Irish Republic was not on the table before the negotiations began, therefore: “I say if we all stood on the recognition of the Irish Republic as a prelude to any conference we could very easily have said so, and there would be no conference.”He then went on to state: “What I want to make clear is that it was the acceptance of the invitation that formed the compromise. I was sent there to form that adaptation, to bear the brunt of it. Now as one of the signatories of the document I naturally recommend its acceptance.These were the words repeated by Mr Paterson, a former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in the House of Commons on Tuesday.In the book The Treaty, Debating and Establishing the Irish State edited by Liam Weeks and Micheál O’Fathartaigh, historian Dr Mel Farrell says Collins speech was “impactful and forced the anti-Treatyites on the defensive”.The Treaty was eventually passed narrowly in the Dáil by 64 votes to 57 in January 1922. In the June 1922 general election pro-Treaty candidates outpolled anti-Treaty candidates by four to one, but it did not prevent the outbreak of the Civil War that month, a war that would lead to the tragic death of Collins at Béal na Bláth on August 22nd 1922.In the House of Commons Paterson said he would vote for Mr Johnson’s bill “without any great enthusiasm” if measures to protect the British fishing industry were implemented and if assurances could be given that the measures pertaining to Northern Ireland were temporary pending a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK.Mr Paterson stated: “If those two issues can be resolved, I will vote for this Bill, albeit without any great enthusiasm, because it sets us on the road. Having mentioned Ireland, it is worth looking at the example of the Republic of Ireland as it emerged from the Irish Free State . . . this Bill begins the process of establishing our full freedom, and I hope that I do not suffer the same fate as Michael Collins in wanting to see that delivered.”The process of disengagement from the Treaty was completed with the declaration of the Republic of Ireland in April 1949.Speaking last year at an event to mark the 70th anniversary of the Republic of Ireland, Fine Gael executive council chair Gerry O’Connell said subsequent events after 1921 vindicated Collins’s belief that the Treaty gave Ireland “the freedom to achieve freedom”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA fellow Quinn Industrial Holdings director of tortured Fermanagh businessman Kevin Lunney said he was “shocked” that former billionaire Sean Quinn would make critical comments about them while condemning the attack.Liam McCaffrey, chief executive of Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH), condemned remarks made by Mr Quinn in an interview last week about the role played by Mr McCaffrey, Mr Lunney and fellow director Dara O’Reilly – all former executives of Mr Quinn’s – in his removal as a senior adviser to the company in 2016. Mr Quinn told Channel 4 News he had “no hand, act or part” in the kidnapping and sustained assault upon Mr Lunney last month, but expressed his disbelief that his “own men who he had looked after for 20 or 25 years” would be involved in his removal as an adviser. He named all three men in the news interview. “The interview was around his denial of any hand, act or part in this, but to take that opportunity to make further critical comment under the circumstances where Kevin had been beaten to within an inch of his life – and Kevin and the remaining directors threatened with death – I thought it was an extraordinary statement,” Mr McCaffrey told The .Campaign of intimidationMr Quinn has condemned the attacks on his former executives, and the long campaign of intimidation and vandalism against his former business. He described the assault on Mr Lunney on September 17th as “despicable and totally barbaric”, and said it was a reason why he was no longer interested in seeking ownership of his former businesses again.Mr McCaffrey worked for Mr Quinn before the 73-year-old lost control of his conglomerate under the weight of about € 4 billion in debts, arising mostly from an ill-fated multi-billion investment on Anglo Irish Bank shares.He rejected his former boss’s criticisms and said Mr Quinn should take responsibility for his own actions. Mr Quinn was removed as an adviser from QIH by the three US investment fund owners of the business because, the funds said, he had grown uncomfortable with his role as an adviser and wanted to take ownership of the company.“Rather than blame everyone else for his ills, he would be well placed to look in the mirror,” said Mr McCaffrey. Further violence fearedThe chief executive of the building materials business, which employs 840 staff in the Cavan-Fermanagh area, said the executives feared further violence given that Mr Lunney’s injuries were “delivered with a threat against us all should we not resign – and that was a death threat”.“There was no indication that that was an end to it. That was a method of delivering a warning,” he said of the attack on Mr Lunney.He said the only way the violence would end was if the “paymaster” behind the attacks was arrested and charged. Law enforcement had to “stand up and be counted”, he said.“Lifting the foot soldiers isn’t enough.” Mr McCaffrey alleged that the gang who carried out the attack came from 40 kilometres away and “work for money”.“They have no beef with the directors of Quinn Industrial Holdings, so undoubtedly they were paid to carry out this task,” he said.In an interview with RTÉ’s Prime Time, Mr Lunney’s brother Tony, also a QIH executive, spoke emotionally about not knowing whether his brother was inside his burning car when it was set ablaze by the gang after they abducted Mr Lunney last month.Mr McCaffrey said Mr Lunney was recovering from his physical injuries, including lacerations and a leg broken in two places that has been fixed with a pin.“The physical injuries will heal but it will be a long way back after that ordeal,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Phootgraph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe boil water notice should be lifted by the weekend for most of the 600,000 people affected, Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has told the Dáil.Mr Murphy said a much smaller group of people was likely to be affected over the weekend, following the notice on Tuesday night to 600,000 homes and businesses in Dublin, Kildare and Meath.Mr Murphy said tankers were not needed because it is a boil water notice and people can boil their water.Earlier, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that the warning for people to boil their water was a precautionary notice. He said it would be a matter of days before the matter was rectified and declined to state when the all-clear would be given.“I don’t want to give a date I cannot stand over,” Mr Varadkar said.He said his own home and family were hit by the warning.Mr Varadkar said the problem arose on Monday when a flaw at the treatment plant in Leixlip allowed untreated water into the system.Mr Calleary said the latest notice from Irish Water said it would take a few more days but did not give a date or time and the website crashed when people sought further information. It was referring people to maps on its website that were difficult to read. “When an event like this happens their communications strategy needs to be robust enough to give people vital information when they need it,” he said. “It does not suggest that Irish Water has the contingency plans to deal with a situation like this.”Mr Varadkar acknowledged that Irish Water’s website crashed under pressure of use after the company advised people to consult it on Tuesday to seek further information. He said the utility’s first obligation was to protect public health. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said it was the most extensive boil water notice issued by Irish Water and asked if the incident at the Leixlip treatment plant last March was connected to this.She said the March incident led to a service audit being ordered by the Environment Protection Agency. Ms McDonald said the problem was a cause of worry as well as an inconvenience for elderly people, young children and those who were ill.“This is a matter of real stress and worry,” she said.The Taoiseach said the problem was rectified. But three “all-clear tests” had to be achieved before the boil notice could be lifted."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4060042.1571824974!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar and tusk support extension with option to leave early","story":"Boris Johnson’s promise to take Britain out of the EU by October 31st “come what may” is proving difficult to fulfil after MPs rejected his plan to push through Brexit legislation.  Video: UK Parliament \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking after the programme motion setting out the proposed timetable for the Brexit withdrawal Agreement Bill was defeated in a vote in the House of Commons in London on October 22nd, 2019. Photograph: AFPGetty Images.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has told President of the European Council Donald Tusk he supports a Brexit extension for the UK.Speaking on Wednesday morning, the pair noted that it would still be possible for the UK to leave before January 31st 2020 if the Withdrawal Agreement was ratified in advance of that date. The issue will be discussed further at Wednesday night’s meeting of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in Brussels. Meanwhile in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to push for an election if EU leaders sanction a Brexit extension of up to three months.Mr Johnson must now wait to hear from the heads of the EU27 after his plans to fast-track his Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the House of Commons before the Halloween deadline failed.There was anger in Downing Street after MPs rejected Mr Johnson’s plan to push through the legislation approving his deal with the EU in just three days by 322 votes to 308.The development makes Mr Johnson’s promise to take Britain out of the EU by October 31st “come what may” difficult to fulfil and means Brexit could be delayed until next year.On a dramatic night in Westminster, the Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said Brexit was now “in purgatory where it is suffering the pains of those in purgatory”.Mr Rees-Mogg added it is “very hard to see how it is possible” for the Bill to pass through the Commons and the Lords before October 31st.The result leaves the prime minister effectively at the mercy of EU leaders who will decide whether to grant Britain a further extension, and for how long, in order to allow it to leave with a deal.European Council president Donald Tusk said he would recommend they agree a further delay in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit.ElectionThe Daily  reported that Mr Johnson had begun calling EU leaders on Tuesday night to tell them he would not accept a three-month delay, but has reportedly not ruled out approving a short extension of around 10 days to allow his deal to get through Parliament.A No 10 source indicated that if the prime minister was forced to accept a delay until the new year, he would push for a general election instead.“On Saturday parliament asked for a delay until January and today parliament blew its last chance,” the source said.“If parliament’s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This parliament is broken.”Following the vote, Mr Johnson said he would “pause” the legislation while he consulted with EU leaders on what should happen next.Just minutes earlier MPs voted to back the deal in principle by 329 to 299 on the second reading of the Bill, the first time the Commons has been prepared to support any Brexit deal.The prime minister expressed “disappointment” that they had not been prepared to follow it up by agreeing the timetable motion.He insisted it was still his policy that Britain should leave at Halloween but acknowledged he would have wait to hear what EU leaders said.Under the terms of the so-called Benn Act, Mr Johnson was forced to write to the EU at the weekend seeking an extension to the end of January after failing to win the support of the Commons at Saturday’s special sitting.Before the vote, Mr Johnson had threatened to pull the whole Bill and go for a general election if the timetable motion was lost but he is yet to outline how he would go about it.‘Reasonable timetable’Jeremy Corbyn said Labour was prepared to work with the UK government to agree “a reasonable timetable” to enable the Commons to debate and scrutinise the legislation properly.“That would be the sensible way forward, and that’s the offer I make on behalf of the opposition tonight,” he said.The Labour leader’s offer potentially opens the way for Parliament to approve the Bill before the end of the year.It also opens up increased opportunities for MPs to seek to amend the legislation in ways the Government would find unacceptable.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said he thinks the EU will grant a three-month extension and, speaking on BBC’s Newsnight, he said: “There’s no excuses now for Jeremy Corbyn not to give us that general election.”Asked about Mr Johnson’s “do-or-die” promises to deliver Brexit on October 31st, he said: “Everyone will have seen the way that Boris Johnson has tried to get Brexit across the line on the 31st of October.”He said that date was ruled out on Tuesday night, adding: “We’re going to have to have an extension.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But there is one thing that their pitch has in common: exam results.And a question often at the forefront of parents’ minds is:  Will it be worth it?With fees rising year on year, how do you know if a school is good value for money? Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next week we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellersby College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellersby College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Those forces were allied with the Kurdish-led fighters for five years in the long and bloody campaign that brought down Isil.The United States has been the Kurds\u0027 closest ally in recent years. (But) in the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them, Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said pointedly on Wednesday. Now they prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks.Or as Mr Cavousoglu put it: “When you are present on the ground, then you are also present on the negotiating table.Russian President Vladimir Putin receives Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in SochiThe US, which was not present at Tuesday’s talks in Mr Putin’s dacha in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, has been shut out of decision-making and left with little leverage to demand assurances for its former Kurdish partners.Mark Esper, US secretary of defence, was in Baghdad on Wednesday meeting with Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to manage the fallout of their quick retreat.The US withdrew the bulk of its some 1,000 troops from Syria on Monday, greeted on the way out by Kurdish residents throwing rotten fruit and holding up signs reading “we will not forget this betrayal”.The Pentagon had announced the troops were expected to move to western Iraq to continue the campaign against Islamic State and to help defend Iraq.But it appeared the move was not first approved by Baghdad, which issued a statement saying they did not have the right to remain in the country.Mr Esper was told he had 30 days to remove the troops.Wednesday evening news briefing: Mystery surrounds route of lorry found in Essex containing 39 bodiesComment: This Labour MP made an incredible gaffe.

US prosecutors unveiled the charges in the past week, piggy-backing on similar actions taken in France and the UK in recent years. Taken together, it’s a dramatic assault on a network of bankers and traders operating on both sides of the Atlantic who allegedly reaped tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits.And yet more is likely to come. It’s unclear from the US complaints who, if anyone, is the mastermind behind the scheme. One trader in Switzerland, who hasn’t been charged, appears in multiple indictments, but isn’t identified.While the profits were allegedly big and the scheme expansive, the basics were relatively simple.Investment bankers got information about pending mergers and acquisitions at work, according to the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They then sold the information to middlemen, who passed it on to traders. The bankers were repaid with cash, expensive holidays, luxury watches and other benefits, according to court filings.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Liberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau waves to supporters beside his wife Sophie after the federal election at the Palais des Congres in Montreal.

To further cover their tracks, the insiders traded using derivatives that are illegal in the US and hard to track by regulators.For example, the group traded in shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Omnicare – among more than a dozen other companies – using so-called contracts for difference (CFDs), which allow investors to make big bets with just a small down payment.At the same time, members of the ring tipped off financial news organisations, including Bloomberg News, hoping to benefit from a pop in the stock price when reporters independently corroborated the information and published the news.Among the “Ocean’s Eleven” crew is George Nikas, a Greek who remains at large in his home country. He allegedly placed most of his trades using CFDs.The 54-year-old has businesses in Europe and the US, including GRK Fresh, a New York chain of Greek fast-food restaurants. Prosecutors say he got information from Bryan Cohen, a Goldman Sachs vice-president in New York. While at one of Mr Nikas’s restaurants, Mr Cohen, 33, would get information about pending takeovers by using his burner phones and would then tell Mr Nikas about deals like one tied to Buffalo Wild Wings, according to prosecutors. Mr Cohen pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court on Tuesday.Mr Nikas allegedly had another source of intel: Telemaque Lavidas, 38, a fellow Greek, whose father was on the board of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. From his father, Mr Lavidas picked up tips about Ariad having to halt clinical trials or being in talks to sell and fed them to Mr Nikas, who made millions of dollars trading on the information, prosecutors say. Mr Lavidas was arrested in New York and has asked to be freed on bail, claiming his role in the conspiracy was “relatively small”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr El-Khouri allegedly traded on inside information obtained from the two London bankers: Benjamin Taylor, 35, who worked at Moelis \u0026amp Co and Darina Windsor, 32, who was at Centerview Partners.For a while the two bankers shared an apartment in London, were romantically involved and called each other Pops and Popsy in messages. For example, in October 2012 Ms Windsor sent an email to Mr Taylor titled “Once upon a time, there was a Pops searching for Truffles in the Forest...”, according to the indictment. Confidential information was allegedly attached to the email.They were paid at least $1m (£778,000) in cash and other benefits, according to the prosecutors. Now, Mr Taylor is in France and Ms Windsor is in her native Thailand, prosecutors said.Mr El-Khouri received tips from Mr Taylor and Ms Windsor through a friend and sent gifts back in return, knowing they would be given to the couple, prosecutors said.Mr Taylor passed price-sensitive information for 16 transactions related to US stocks that he and Ms Windsor got at work, which was passed on to a network of traders in Switzerland and London, prosecutors said.In one January 2013 deal, Mr Taylor accessed confidential merger details regarding Life Technologies, even though he wasn’t assigned to the project. Mr Taylor passed those documents to an unnamed trader who then either directly or indirectly sent them to a reporter at a Canadian newspaper, the SEC said. Days later, the outlet published that Life Technologies was exploring a sale, sending its shares soaring.Mr Lavidas’s lawyer Reed Smith points out in his bail request that the statute of limitations may have run out on some of the crimes. The statute of limitations for wire fraud is five years, unless it affects a financial institution –\u0026nbspthen it’s 10 years.“Two of the nine counts against Mr Lavidas are likely time-barred as they are for wire fraud activities that allegedly occurred in 2013,” Mr Smith wrote.US Securities and Exchange Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

US prosecutors unveiled the charges in the past week, piggy-backing on similar actions taken in France and the UK in recent years. Taken together, it’s a dramatic assault on a network of bankers and traders operating on both sides of the Atlantic who allegedly reaped tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits.And yet more is likely to come. It’s unclear from the US complaints who, if anyone, is the mastermind behind the scheme. One trader in Switzerland, who hasn’t been charged, appears in multiple indictments, but isn’t identified.While the profits were allegedly big and the scheme expansive, the basics were relatively simple.Investment bankers got information about pending mergers and acquisitions at work, according to the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They then sold the information to middlemen, who passed it on to traders. The bankers were repaid with cash, expensive holidays, luxury watches and other benefits, according to court filings.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Liberal leader and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau waves to supporters beside his wife Sophie after the federal election at the Palais des Congres in Montreal.

Police had earlier fired rubber bullets as they struggled to stop looters who targeted businesses as unrest broke out in several spots in and around the cityThe ring had access to dozens of insider tips and used in-person meetings and “burner” cell phones to avoid detection. To further cover their tracks, the insiders traded using derivatives that are illegal in the US and hard to track by regulators.For example, the group traded in shares of Onyx Pharmaceuticals and Omnicare – among more than a dozen other companies – using so-called contracts for difference (CFDs), which allow investors to make big bets with just a small down payment.At the same time, members of the ring tipped off financial news organisations, including Bloomberg News, hoping to benefit from a pop in the stock price when reporters independently corroborated the information and published the news.Among the “Ocean’s Eleven” crew is George Nikas, a Greek who remains at large in his home country. He allegedly placed most of his trades using CFDs.The 54-year-old has businesses in Europe and the US, including GRK Fresh, a New York chain of Greek fast-food restaurants. Prosecutors say he got information from Bryan Cohen, a Goldman Sachs vice-president in New York. While at one of Mr Nikas’s restaurants, Mr Cohen, 33, would get information about pending takeovers by using his burner phones and would then tell Mr Nikas about deals like one tied to Buffalo Wild Wings, according to prosecutors. Mr Cohen pleaded not guilty in a Manhattan court on Tuesday.Mr Nikas allegedly had another source of intel: Telemaque Lavidas, 38, a fellow Greek, whose father was on the board of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. From his father, Mr Lavidas picked up tips about Ariad having to halt clinical trials or being in talks to sell and fed them to Mr Nikas, who made millions of dollars trading on the information, prosecutors say. Mr Lavidas was arrested in New York and has asked to be freed on bail, claiming his role in the conspiracy was “relatively small”.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr El-Khouri allegedly traded on inside information obtained from the two London bankers: Benjamin Taylor, 35, who worked at Moelis \u0026amp Co and Darina Windsor, 32, who was at Centerview Partners.For a while the two bankers shared an apartment in London, were romantically involved and called each other Pops and Popsy in messages. For example, in October 2012 Ms Windsor sent an email to Mr Taylor titled “Once upon a time, there was a Pops searching for Truffles in the Forest...”, according to the indictment. Confidential information was allegedly attached to the email.They were paid at least $1m (£778,000) in cash and other benefits, according to the prosecutors. Now, Mr Taylor is in France and Ms Windsor is in her native Thailand, prosecutors said.Mr El-Khouri received tips from Mr Taylor and Ms Windsor through a friend and sent gifts back in return, knowing they would be given to the couple, prosecutors said.Mr Taylor passed price-sensitive information for 16 transactions related to US stocks that he and Ms Windsor got at work, which was passed on to a network of traders in Switzerland and London, prosecutors said.In one January 2013 deal, Mr Taylor accessed confidential merger details regarding Life Technologies, even though he wasn’t assigned to the project. Mr Taylor passed those documents to an unnamed trader who then either directly or indirectly sent them to a reporter at a Canadian newspaper, the SEC said. Days later, the outlet published that Life Technologies was exploring a sale, sending its shares soaring.Mr Lavidas’s lawyer Reed Smith points out in his bail request that the statute of limitations may have run out on some of the crimes. The statute of limitations for wire fraud is five years, unless it affects a financial institution –\u0026nbspthen it’s 10 years.“Two of the nine counts against Mr Lavidas are likely time-barred as they are for wire fraud activities that allegedly occurred in 2013,” Mr Smith wrote.US Securities and Exchange Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Quantum computers are theoretically capable of doing work vastly quicker than the computers we use today, and could fundamentally alter our understanding of the capability of machines.IBM researchers have already criticised Google’s claims of a breakthrough, suggesting that the new discovery is not as profound as promised. But the new research has finally been published in the prestigious journal\u0026nbspNature, and lays out the workings of the long-rumoured breakthrough.The Google researchers state in the paper that their computer, known as Sycamore, is able to conduct a task in 200 seconds that would take around 10,000 years on a traditional system.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm,” the researchers write in the newly published paper.‘Quantum apocalypse’: How super computers could cripple governmentsThe task used by Google researchers to test their system is largely useless for now, and its main function is to generate random numbers. But it is the first time that any task of this kind has ever been successfully demonstrated, and could very soon lead to more practical applications, the researchers claim.“As a result of these developments, quantum computing is transitioning from a research topic to a technology that unlocks new computational capabilities,” the researchers conclude. “We are only one creative algorithm away from valuable near-term applications.”The company now hopes to build a system that can conduct more broad operations, which could be used across a variety of different fields.“Achieving the necessary computational capabilities will still require years of hard engineering and scientific work. But we see a path clearly now, and we’re eager to move ahead.”Google’s breakthrough had been rumoured since an early version of the paper was leaked online last month. But the publication of the research in\u0026nbspNature\u0026nbspis the first time it has been publicly discussed, and anyone can read the researchers’ work.It had already been criticised by IBM, who argued that the paper was fundamentally flawed because Google had drastically overestimated the difficulty of the task and how long it would take on a classical computer. The task would actually take around 2.5 days on a classical\u0026nbspcomputer and would be completed more effectively than it was with Google’s quantum computer, the firm argued in a blog post published two days before the\u0026nbspNature paper was made available, though it is yet to demonstrate the claim.The phrase “quantum supremacy” has also attracted criticism, both for its similarity to white supremacy and the fact it could encourage more hyped reporting on the status of quantum technology. Both of those arguments were addressed by John Preskill, the scientist who coined the phrase in 2012, in a recent article where he concluded that Google’s breakthrough is nonetheless very significant.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They say the sector is making progress cutting greenhouse gas output.Workers’ rights groups have previously called for mass retraining in renewables to ensure former oil and gas employees are not left behind in the ongoing transition.

It may also consolidate the Syrian\u0026nbspgovernment\u0027s hold over northeastern Syria which until two weeks ago had been controlled by Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPresident Vladimir\u0026nbspPutin opened the Tuesday press conference saying\u0026nbspthat Moscow “appreciates” Turkey’s national security concerns but insists “Syria must be free from foreign military presence.”Mr Erdogan outlined the understanding saying:\u0026nbsp”The main aim of the operation is to take out PKKYPG terror organisations from the area and to facilitate the return of Syrian\u0026nbsprefugees.”“This operation also guarantees\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspterritorial integrity and political unity. We never had any interest in Syria\u0026nbspland and sovereignty,” he added.The two presidents met as a five-day cease-fire between Turkish troops and Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria was set to expire.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The numbers will be tight today.One minister believes things are so close that the Speaker John Bercow may end up having to break a tied vote. It is remarkable that Boris Johnson is so close to winning this vote.When the Chief Whip Mark Spencer went through the numbers with the Cabinet on Wednesday, he had the Government succeeding by one vote with the support of the DUP’s ten MPs. But they are now voting against the deal.When Cabinet met again yesterday afternoon, Spencer “scrupulously avoided giving any numbers”, according to one of those present.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who did the numbers for Boris’s leadership bid, said the Government couldn’t afford to lose more than two or three of its own Brexiteers. But with them on board, victory was possible.Without the DUP’s support, which is gone despite Boris Johnson’s belief that they can still be won round, the Government will need the backing of  MPs who were elected as Labour in .Cabinet opinion is split on whether they can get this number. One Cabinet minister intimately involved in the bid to woo Labour MPs thinks they are going to get there.“We’re going to win”, this Secretary of State declares. Others in Cabinet are more sceptical though.One tells me: “I’ll believe it when I see it”, pointing out that Theresa May thought she would do better with Labour MPs on every meaningful vote than she actually did. This minister’s view: “We’re going to fall just short.”Another group whose position is key is the  MPs who lost the Tory whip for voting for the Benn Act, which forces the Government to ask for a Brexit extensionMPs don’t back this deal. Downing Street calculate that  of this group will vote for the deal.Three Cabinet ministers — Nicky Morgan, Michael Gove and Robert Buckland — met with a chunk of the  on Thursday afternoon. One of those present tells me: “It wasn’t great. Hammond was particularly dficult.”This source says that watching Hammond, he thought that the former Chancellor “can’t see past that hatred” he has for Boris Johnson.I suspect that most of the  will back the Government, most of them want a deal and many of them want the whip back so they can stand at the next election.As one senior Cabinet minister tells me: “Voting for us is the way back in. We need to be able to count on them for the WAB”, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Then, there are those so-called Spartans — the Tory Brexiteers who wouldn’t vote for May’s deal even at the third time of asking. Downing Street is confident that pretty much all of them will back the deal.I understand that David Trimble, the former Northern Ireland First Minister who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, will attend this morning’s meeting of the hardcore Brexiteer European Research Group to explain why the deal is in line with the Good Friday Agreement, contrary to what the DUP say.Today, MPs have a chance to honour the referendum result. To vote for a deal that will deliver a smooth, orderly and amicable departure from the EU.If they vote to block it, then they will have shown that they are just determined to stop Brexit and that all those promises to respect the referendum result were made with their fingers crossed behind their backs.THERE’S always a twist with Brexit and today’s is something called the Letwin amendment.If it passes, it would prevent a clean up or down vote on the deal. That would have to wait until a second reading on Tuesday.Instead, the Letwin amendment would force Boris Johnson to request an extension regardless and the Commons would only vote on his deal once all the relevant legislation is through.As one exasperated ally of the PM puts it, the vote on the Letwin amendment is “almost as signicant as the vote itself”. The Letwin amendment is just a preview of the parliamentary mischief to come.As the Government tries to get the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through, MPs will try to add all sorts of things to it.Expect amendments trying to compel the Government to negotiate a customs union with the EU or follow EU rules on things even after Brexit.In a way, these amendments won’t matter. They won’t change the content of the treaty the UK has signed with the EU.But they will impose legal obligations on the Government. Now,Boris won a majority in an election, he could override these changes.But the danger for him is that Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party could attack him in the campaign for having passed a deal that has had all these horrors added to it.WE may have a sensible chief medical officer at last.After Sally Davies – who wanted a ban on eating and drinking anything other than water on public transport – we have Chris Whitty.In his first public outing this week, he argued that people should exercise more, stop smoking and keep talking to slow the aging process. Sensible, commonsense advice.Whitty, who was the force behind tackling the  Ebola outbreak, is a pleasant change from the lecturing of the past few years.NUMBER  are oddly relaxed about whether the deal passes today or not. One of the Prime Minister’s most trusted confidants describes it as, “an each-way bet for Boris”.Why, because – in his words –voters, “learn on Saturday that the deal has been voted down, who are they going to blame: Boris or the MPs They’ll blame the MPs”. Inside Number , they think thatBrexiteer MPs back the deal and Remain MPs block it, they can have A CAKE AND EAT IT election strategy.In Labour Leave-supporting seats in Wales, the West Midlands and the North East, they can say: “Your MP is blocking Brexit, vote for us to get it done.”While in the seats they are defending against the Liberal Democrats that are more nervous about Brexit, they can say: “Back us and the UK will leave in a smooth and orderly fashion:This two-pronged message would be electorally potent. It would give the Tories a chance of winning their biggest majority in more than  years.Number  are determined to keep trying for an election despite the Commons blocking it. One source jokes that MPs will be “voting on an election every day until they crack”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under Theresa May’s we could have been trapped in it forever, unable to do global trade deals.To put it back into the agreement kills it. Not least because the deal agreed with Brussels is merely the mechanism by which we leave — it is not meant to determine our future relationship.One Labour MP vows to support Boris’s Bill, then back this amendment destroying it. If the public considers MPs ocean-going idiots, this is why.But the EU should help get the deal over the line by rejecting the extension Remainers forced the PM to request.MPs would have to pass it or revoke Brexit. They lack the guts for the latter.HARRY and Meghan are not victims. Not of tabloid “bullying”. Not of racism.Their claim that they are “existing, not living” is a tin-eared insult to millions who find joy despite daily struggles dwarfing those of this cosseted pair.The Sun could not have been happier for them when they married. We called their magical wedding “a wonderful symbol of the country we have become. Open, warm-hearted, brilliantly erse”.We’re sorrythey didn’t understand that along with the adulation would come other stories in the public interest — and scrutinythey chose to lecture the public on how to live their lives.Instead of maturely accepting it, or ignoring it, they declared war on the Press and indulged in a giant whinge.No, Royals with publicly-funded mansions, fabulous holidays and staff are not disqualied from being unhappy. Harry and Meghan do seem to be ­vulnerable and need help. But they should count their many blessings too.And spare a thought for those who endure crippling rents, mortgages, bills and tough, low-paid jobs with far more fortitude and less self-pity.FUNNY how so many MPs trashing our democracy no longer have skin in the game.Take giggling birdbrain Oliver Letwin whose calamitous career, a bulging ­dossier of catastrophic failure, will end before the next election. Or Speaker Bercow — the grandiloquent, circumlocutory, periphrastic, tautological Remainer slug — who is off soon too.Meanwhile Labour is now openly betraying its  Leave voters while desperately trying to avoid an election.So many politicians — unaccountable and yet key to thwarting the .million majority.

At the very least I think she should have been given a break when she was pregnant.I particularly feel for her about her relationship with her dad and her family as that must be hard to deal with in itself, and even worse when every communication she attempts to have with her family is all over every newspaper.For me she has done nothing wrong but seems to get a lot more bad press than Kate.In the clip where she says she’s struggling, I think the sadness in her eyes says everything.PR expert and dad-of-three Anthony Burr, , of Burr Media, lives in London. He says:Sacrices are expected from any royal and once you enter what we term ‘public le’ it is just that – you live your le in the public view.Meghan was being as open and as candid as we have seen any royal, possibly since Diana. Yet as a Royal there is protocol and there is a duty to protect the Queen and the realm.Meghan has to strike that balance.It is possible to sacrice parts of your privacy whilst also keeping other parts private. William and Kate are striking that balance perfectly.The problem with being too candid is you leave yourself open to enemies. As a dad, I will ask my girls to decide carefully when and who you should be open with.It’s not easy for Meghan, and it will take some time but she can bridge that gap between celebrity and royal andshe gets it right then she can be an icon for years to come.His daughter Tatjana Mager-Burr, , is a Year  student.She says: Its a democratic country. Meghan and Harry should be able to speak their minds.How open they should be really depends on the situation. [Perhaps not]Meghans having arguments with Harry... you dont want the royal family to be viewed as falling apart.Its unusual for royals to come clean about their situation - they usually stay reserved. I feel [this documentary] could be a way of opening up attitudes towards the royals.Biba Tanya, , is a blogger from Ribble Valley in Lancashire.She says: It’s the ‘poor me’ attitude that I just think is absurd. What was the quote  ‘We’re existing but not living’  Are you f*****g joking me There are people using food banks who are existing and not living, sweetheart, not people who are flying private jets to their baby showers. That’s not living, that’s living in style. Her line ‘thank you so much for asking’ - it’s pathetic! I got an A* in Drama Megan, I’m probably about as talented as you are!Harry threw a royal tantrum a few days ago when he was asked a rogue question by a reporter. It was a perfectly reasonable question and he completely flipped his lid.William is more of an example. He doesn’t complain at least. It’s the complaining that everyone’s finding unbearable. It does make me smile when I see that Kate’s handling this with such aplomb. Shes never complained once – she just cracks on.Who are you  You’re just these mythical creatures who live off our money without letting us know what you’re truly thinking.I once went on GMB and publicly declared that I don’t vaccinate my children – you want to see the trolling that I got. I’m a big girl – I pulled my big girl pants up and got on with it! What are they upset about Her son Sebastian Haywood is .He says: Meghans finding it hard being in the limelight as a member of the royal family, especially since she was raised like an average child and isn’t used to this.They stated that they only feel happy in Africa and don’t like being in the limelight. If they feel that it’s best for them to leave the royal family and go to Africa then they should go.Also Meghan is facing the pressure of being in the spotlight plus the hardship of being a new mother. She also has the social pressure put on her by the media always expecting her to put on a smile and act like everything is okay.School safeguarding head Jane Baldwin lives in Kent.She says: I think in their position they are a representation of our country and should not air their dirty laundry in public.I also believe in these dficult political times, when people are facing job loss etc, moaning about media coverage - which I might add is what charities need and is the purpose of their tour and not forgetting Meghan’s movie career thrived on this - is not appropriate.I have always thought Harry tried to be in touch with us common folk, following his mums approach. However this recent documentary just highlighted the disconnect between the le they lead and what his people would consider real le issues, like paying a mortgage and having a job.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”Sources told The Times they would have been in touch, and a line had been drawn in the fallout of Harrys remarks on his sibling relationship.They added: These are conversations that should take place privately.

we have ious workbooks we use - but try to keep it as minimal as possible.I want the kids to learn through hands-on experiences.“We eventually want to school them around the world and travel to dferent countries and continents and learn about everything literally on the go.“We want them to learn through real le.There [are] so many lessons that can’t be taught in a classroom of thirty-eight.Right now, the plan is to continue home-schooling and eventually world-school when we are financially able.Taylor says she doesnt like either the methods used in mainstream schools or the content of the normal syllabus.“Mostly what we find unappealing about traditional school is that it’s all about standardised testing and regurgitating information, she said.“You’re not there to learn, you’re there to recite information and get good test scores.Not to mention all the important things that they don’t teach, like accurate historical events and African American culture and history.“On top of that it doesn’t nurture imagination and creativity.Children aren’t meant to sit down and be still and quiet for six to eight hours a day.They are supposed to run around and touch things and ask a billion silly questions.Taylor admits to being concerned that homeschooling could mean her children dont interact enough with other kids or people, but adds: “My children have lots of friends that they see regularly and absolutely no problem making new friends.My oldest is the most outgoing child I’ve probably ever met.Taylor also encourages anyone sceptical of her and Dereks approach to keep an open mind.“We’re not withholding education from our children, were just allowing them to learn in a way that works best for them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry stronger out of touch royals","story":"PRINCE Harry has hit back at his brother’s claims he is “fragile” by insisting he has never felt stronger.He also accused the royal institution of failing to support him and his we Meghan.Sources close to the Duke of Sussex told The Sun the reaction to ITV’s Harry and Meghan documentary was hysterical and panicked.They say the royal institution fears it looks out of touch and to blame for the lack of backing.Harry went public with his feud with Prince William on Sunday night in interviews with ITV’s Tom Bradby for Harry  Meghan: An African Journey.He said the pair had good and bad days and were on “dferent paths”.Meghan also said she was struggling with the scrutiny of being a royal and branded the British stf-upper-lip attitude damaging.Royal insiders have criticised Harry, , and Meghan, , for airing their problems publicly.And William, , reportedly said his brother “is in a fragile place”.But one of the sources close to Harry responded by telling The Sun last night : “Harry is back at Frogmore Cottage and has never been stronger.“This is an institution full of people panicked they may potentially look out of touch and ultimately to blame for a lack of support.”Another royal insider said: “There is an obvious rt between the brothers and it’s been getting worse over the past few months.”In a briefing to US media yesterday, a source close to Harry and Meghan said they had “single-handedly modernised the monarchy”.CNN also reported claims the monarchy was “inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple”.Meghan has made her first public engagement since Sunday’s documentary on her struggles as a royal and problems adopting a British “stf upper lip”.But Meghan kept quiet at the Royal Albert Hall on the fallout from the ITV show — or Harry’s rt with brother William.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, depressed young people may increasingly turn to social media late into the night.A spokesperson for Facebook said it has introduced a number of measures to protect young people’s wellbeing.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

But they need to work as a team with the rest of the royal household and, rightly or wrongly, there is a lot of distrust right now.The aide also said there was a startling lack of self-awareness over problems Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have created - including the row over their private jet use this summer.US broadcaster CNN yesterday revealed how some Palace insiders were reportedly determined to fuel anti-Prince Harry and Meghan hysteria.But the source told the Mail: Its akin to saying that [Harry and Meghan] are too good for the royal family, which is extremely disrespectful to everyone who works for, and on behalf of, the Queen and other senior members of the royal family.The truth is that no-one is anti Harry and Meghan and no-one is briefing against them.And it is also just plain wrong to say they have single-handedly modernised have single-handedly modernised the monarchy. Modernisation is an ongoing process led by the Queen.None of this is remotely helpful to the monarchy as an institution. It is promoting discord and taking attention away from the good works senior royals do across the board.The royal couples emotional and candid interviews in the ITV doc have reportedly worried senior royals.Harry spoke about his relationship with brother William - causing a rt in his inner circle with some praising him for being tactful and truthful while others suggested he shouldve denied a spat.The prince told ITV: We don’t see each other as much as we used to because we’re so busy.“But I love him dearly and the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. But as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.”Royal insiders have now revealed William is worried about the pair - who appeared vulnerable - and hoped they are all right.And it is understood the Queen would have been a little bit dismayed by the broadcast of personal relationship details to the public. Within hours of airing, sources were playing down suggestions William was “furious” with Harry over the documentary.Meghan Markle last night brushed off the brewing Palace row as she appeared at the One Young World Summit at the Royal Albert Hall in London.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also lets Russian and Syrian troops control the rest of the border.Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the agreement was very important,not momentous, to resolve what is a pretty tense situation which has developed on the Syrian-Turkish border”.It prompted Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish programme at the Washington Institute, to boast on Twitter: “The outcome of the Putin-Erdogan meeting in Sochi today indicates that Erdogan has become a master of leveraging the US and Russia against each other to maximise Ankara’s gains.“Turkey got the safe zone it wanted all this time.”A complete pullout would mark a victory for Erdogan, who launched Turkeys incursion on October  to drive the Kurdish militia from the border and create a safe zone for theof Syrian refugees.However, Germanys defence minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer,  has proposed the establishment of an internationally-controlled security zone in Syria.Kramp-Karrenbauer said the German parliament would need to decide on whether German troops could participate in such a zone.German chancellor Angela Merkel said the idea seemed very promising, eventhere are many questions.Turkey will maintain control over the areas it holds since its incursion of northeastern Syria on October  to drive the Kurdish militia from the border.It also lets Russian and Syrian troops control the rest of the border.Syrian border guards will be deployed from noon on October  - when Turkeys five-day cease-fire expired.Six days later, Russian and Turkish forces will jointly start to patrol a narrower, km strip of land in the “safe zone” that Ankara has long sought in northeast Syria.Kurdish fighters completed their pullout from areas Turkey invaded this month.A Kremlin spokesman warned thatKurdish forces dont fully retreat from the entire northeastern Syrian border, they will face the Turkish army.Under the deal with Moscow, theof border which the Kurds would be required to pull back from is more than triple the size of the territory covered by the US-Turkish accord.In a victory for Turkey, this covers most of the area it had wanted to initially include in its safe zone.The agreement achieves Turkeys long-held goal of a border strip cleared of the US allies, which Ankara regards as a terrorist organisation because of their links to insurgents inside Turkey.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That could prompt Boris Johnson to drop his paused deal altogether and push for an election. It came after a night of Commons drama just nine days before the UK is meant to leave the EU. And yet again it leaves us all in limbo just when we thought we’d get a final decision. So what happened tonight and what happens now  Here’s what you need to know.  MPs voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its second reading .This is legislation that turns Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit deal into UK law. In a historic move, MPs finally backed it - - which naturally is % to %. But crucially, they voted against the ‘programme motion’. The programme motion sets how much time the Commons has to scrutinise a Bill. Johnson had wanted to restrict this to just three days in order to meet his  “do or die” pledge to leave the EU by October . MPs said that was too short for such a momentous piece of legislation and voted down the programme motion by  votes to .  Yes, it looks like it. European Council President Donald Tusk tonight sent a message to all  EU leaders telling them they should delay Brexit for three months. This is in accordance with the request MPs forced Boris Johnson to send over the weekend. Boris Johnsonaposs decision to pause the process of ratication of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Mr Tusk wrote. I will recommend the EU accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure. A written procedure suggests a special summit in Brussels would not be convened. What happens now with the Brexit deal   Boris Johnson had warned he would pull the whole Withdrawal Agreement Billhe lost the vote on the programme motion. Instead he “paused” the Bill while he waits to see what Brussels decides. But he could now drop the Bill after all and push for an election after the EU indicated itaposll back a three-month delay to January . That is because he had previously threatened to do exactly thata three-month extension was granted. He had told MPs: “I will in no way allow months more of this. “If Parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen, and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this. “With great regret I must say the Bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election . Can Boris Johnson actually force an election  No. No matter what he claims, he needs MPsapos permission. More of this further down this article. Can Brexit still happen on October    Technically yes, but it’s very unlikely. The only way isEU leaders refuse an extension. Notably the PM and No refused to guarantee the UK will still leave on October . The pledge - usually throughout his speeches - was notably absent tonight. But the PM said he would ramp up preparations for a no-deal exit just in case.  No. Whatever happens Boris Johnson will now have missed this deadline, despite saying he would rather “die in a ditch” than remain in the EU after that date. Eventhe EU grants him a short extension there is no guarantee his Bill will get through Parliament in its current form. That is because Opposition MPs have tabled amendments to the Bill. They include calls for the UK to stay in a customs union, for a second referendum and a move to stop Johnson crashing out without a deal later down the track.MPs who voted for the Withdrawal Bill at the second reading, including many of the  Labour MPs who backed it this time, could turn against it at the final showdownthese amendments are not accepted. That depends on theand terms of any extension. There are three paths to an election. Boris Johnson could try again to overturn the Fixed Term Parliament Act but this requires a majority of two thirds of MPs . This means Labour can block the move. The second way is for Johnson to try to repeal the Act entirely but this would allow opposition parties to amend the Bill. They could add votes at age  or a second referendum as the price for granting an election. The other method is for the Prime Minister to be ousted in a vote of no confidence. MPs would then have fourteen days in which to form an alternative government. If that proves impossible an election follows  working days later.The risk with this is either Jeremy Corbyn or a government of national unity could take over and then arrange for soft Brexit that would be put to a referendum. MPs voted - for the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - a majority of . Bear in mind this was only a vote aposin principleapos on the first steps of the Brexit deal. Many of the  Labour backers were expected to back amendments on a customs union or second referendum which PM said was unacceptable. Meaning they could have turned against it later. But it was backed by  Tories,  Labour MPs and  Independents - most of them ex-Tories who lost the whip last month for trying to block no-deal. Europhile Ken Clarke, former ministers Amber Rudd, David Gauke, and author of the Letwin amendment Oliver Letwin were among those who backed the deal. A number of former and suspended Labour MPs also voted to give the deal a reading at Committee Stage, including Kelvin Hopkins and John Woodcock. It was opposed by  Labour MPs, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change,  Independents and the DUP. Opponents were furious at the deal for watering down workersapos rights and leaving a customs border in the Irish Sea. Five Labour MPs abstained or did not vote - Derek Twigg, Justin Madders, Yvonne Fogue, Ronnie Campbell and committed Brexiteer Kate Hoey.

It comes after Downing St last night confirmed that Boris Johnson would push MPs for a snap pollthe EU agreed an expected three month extension to Brexit - until January  . It means Britain could be headed to the polls before Christmas. Appearing on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain Mr Burgon said: We want a general election , we want to get the Tories out as soon as possible. On the Today programme he added: As soon as no-deal is off the table we want a general election to get the Tories out, we are not in the business of leaving the Conservatives in power. Last night European Council President Donald Tusk said he would call on the EU to back Britainaposs call for the three month extension.    The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that the government would call a pollthataposs the only way of resolving this Brexit deadlock, then yes, bring it on. Last night a No.  source said the government would call an election. They said: Parliament and Corbyn have repeatedly voted for delay. On Saturday Parliament asked for a delay until January and today Parliament blew its last chance. If Parliament’s delay is agreed by Brussels, then the only way the country can move on is with an election. This Parliament is broken. The public will have to choose whether they want to get Brexit done with Boris or whether they want to spend  having two referendums on Brexit and Scotland with Corbyn. It comes as Britain faces fresh chaos as the Prime Minister was forced to abandon his do or die October  deadline vow and ask the EU for a further delay to the UKaposs departure.    Earlier today Boris Johnson lost a vote on his preferred timetable for passing Brexit legislation. He was forced to pause the process and to ask the EU to decide on what he called Parliamentaposs request for a further delay to Britainaposs departure. The PM paused his Brexit deal after the House of Commons refused to accept a bid to rush it through in three days. The dayaposs events sees the PM forced to abandon his do or die vows to leave the EU by the October  deadline - in just nine daysapos time. Downing Street earlier today refused to confirm the UK would still leave by the hard-line deadline of Halloween .    Instead Mr Johnson said: One way or another we will leave the EU with this deal to which the House has just given its assent. The development saw EU chief Donald Tusk confirm he would ask the blocaposs  members states to agree to Mr Johnsonaposs forced request for a three-month delay, in an effort to avoid a no-deal Brexit. The EU members do not have to accept the request, and can force a shorter extension. Mr Johnson was backed into reluctantly requesting the extension on Saturday, after MPs forced his hand.

Warwickshire County Council suspended the aposRespect Yourselfapos site after backlash from campaign groups said it aposnormalised sadomasochistic sex and pornapos. Online advice included telling a -year-old girl that it was aposperfectly naturalapos to struggle to sleep because she was spending aposhalf the nightapos masturbating and watching porn.It also provided descriptions of aposnicheapos sex acts in its aposSextionaryapos to help youngsters understand terms they may have heard, as reported by the.   Under a heading aposDoes anal sex make you pregnant apos on the website, it read: A lot of people think that the whole notion of anal sex is reserved for porn stars or gay men - well in fact cultures since the dawn of time have used bum sex as a form of contraception. It allowed couples who were not necessarily married or ready to have children a means of having penetrative sex without the risk of getting pregnant. A spokeswoman for the campaign group Safe Schools Alliance , Tracy Shaw, said: It’s totally inappropriate. Teenagers are already under so much pressure because of what they see in porn. This website is normalising porn and the type of sex teenagers are unlikely to get. If the message they are getting from the council is [dangerous sex] is fine, how will they feel when they are uncomfortable  They will think there is something wrong with them. We are not against sex education, but we need to show how damaging porn is. We are coming at this from a safeguarding point of view.    Respect Yourself, which currently says it is aposunder reviewapos, contained information about issues including puberty and STIs, and also hosted a QA section where visitors could ask for advice. One -year-old girl said she had a crush on her female music teacher and canapost sleep because she is addicted to masturbation. The response said: What you are going through is perfectly natural for a girl your age - for some reason we have the idea that only boys gets turned on, masturbate or watch porn. That is nonsense. It continued: Before I go any further I need to point out that there is no way that you would ever be able to act on your feeling for your teacher. In another section, it tells teens not to be embarrassed by porn and masturbation, saying: You may have seen there’s been quite a lot in the media recently about the dangers and harms that porn causes to young people.    Many people have been quite vocal and do truly believe that porn is dangerous for young people to watch. However, there are no scientic studies that give evidence to suggest that watching porn is any more likely to turn you into a sex addict than watching a violent film is likely to turn you into a serial killer. In fact there is more evidence to suggest the opposite. Campaign groups SSA and Click Off started a petition against the website and still want answers over how some of the content came to be published, including the aposSextionaryapos section which described some sex acts as painful. Both say it failed to discuss the fact young women usually experience these as aposrisky and coerciveapos. In a joint statement, both argued it was inaccurate to say watching porn is not linked to harmful sexual behaviour. It read: In failing to condemn the use of pornography the Respect Yourself guidance is effectively sacricing the best interests of women and girls in order to seem ‘sex positive.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"girl 8 left burns neck","story":"NewsGirl, , left with burns on neck and face from toxic slime at Nickelodeon eventEXCLUSIVE: Stacey Southam, from the West Midlands, slammed the reaction of staff at the Nickelodeon Slime Fest and claims they initially ignored her daughters complaintsShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsEmelia Southam was left with burns to her face \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The family-friendly concert featured rapper Professor Green, dance troupe, Diversity, and YouTube duo Max and Harvey and saw crowds of youngsters covered in slime from cannons in the slime pit, while parents watched on in a standing section nearby. Stacey, , says her daughter is still recovering from her experience and had to be treated for burns to her face and neck as well as above her backside.    According to Stacey, Emelia complained to staff twice that her skin was being burned by the slime - but was initially ignored.

Lisa Adams, , stayed with husband Steven Adams, , at the hotel in Priory Marina, Bedford, during a trip to visit their grandchildren in September. They paid £ for their one-night stay but, in the morning, gran-of-three Lisa claims she found her legs and lower tummy riddled with itchy and inflamed red bites - a claim the hotel strongly denies.The angry guest reported the problem but says a member of staff promised to investigate after admitting weaposve not had any problems like this for a long time. And six weeks on, Lisa says the bites have become infected and were leaking pus, leaving her feeling itchy all over and like her blood is aposboilingapos inside her.    The grandmother, who herself is a customer service manager, said: I was gobsmacked when the pharmacist I visited said it looked like I had bed bug bites. But Premier Inn said it investigated Lisaaposs complaint but external specialists found no evidence of bed bugs in the room she was allocated. Lisa, of St Austell, Cornwall, continued: I felt a bit dirty with all these red blotches on me. I scrubbed in the shower in case anything was still on me, it didnapost make me feel very nice at all. They were on the front and back of my legs from the ankle to the top of my leg and the bottom of my stomach.    They were very itchy but I didnapost want to scratch them because they already sore and I didnapost want to make them more painful. Weaposve been to Mexico and travelled to Australia, China and lots of dferent places and Iaposve never been bitten by anything. Now I think I might have an infection because my body is itching all over and it feels like my blood is boiling inside me. Lisa, wearing a long pyjama top, got under the duvet and fell asleep after enjoying a meal out with HGV driver Steven. The room looked clean to the naked eye, there were no obvious signs of anything dirty but I didnapost pull back the sheets and check the mattress and the duvet, she said.  When you walk into a hotel you donapost expect to have to check things like that. When we got up my husband said Iaposd been a bit restless in the night - [Iaposm not sure] whether I was conscious that something was happening or whether it was because I was in a strange place. After noticing her wounds, Lisa binned their overnight suitcase and £-worth of clothing in the fear she might take any creepy crawly stowaways with her. Lisa added: The way theyaposve handled the complain is appalling. Given the severity of the bites it needed to be highlighted. If that had been an older person they may not be robust enough to fight the infection as I have, it could have been worse. To be fobbed off the way I was is just not right, I wonapost be staying with Premier Inn again after this.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFriends of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have accused the royal family of not giving them the recognition they deserve. In an astonishing attack, sources claimed Harry and Meghan have “single-handedly modernised the monarchy” yet advisers remain incapable of “harnessing their value”. It followed a row over the couple’s comments in a TV documentary on Sunday, in which they spoke of their “struggle” with le in the public eye.And it came as Meghan, , was tonight seen for the first time since the ITV show aired, smiling as she attended the One Young World Summit opening ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall in London.   Max Foster, an anchor and royal correspondent for US news network CNN, said a source close to the Sussexes told him: “The institution around the royal family is full of people afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value of the royal couple who, they said, ‘have single-handedly modernised the monarchy’.” Buckingham Palace aides tonight refused to comment – but the news sent shockwaves through the ious households. The Mirror previously revealed that senior royals believed Harry and Meghan were “in a moment of crisis” after their candid comments aired on Sunday, in a documentary covering their recent tour.  Harry, , has finally confirmed rumours of a rt with brother Prince William that palace aides had been at pains to deny. Speaking to ITV news anchor Tom Bradby, who he has been friends with for nearly  years, he said: “Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under inevitably, you know, stuff happens. “But look, we’re brothers. We’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and I know he’ll always be there for me.  “You know, we don’t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we’re so busy. But I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. Just as I said, as brothers, you have good days, you have bad days.” Sources have confirmed to the Mirror that the brothers have spoken and “frank words were exchanged”. Sources close to William – who reportedly did not see the documentary ahead of its broadcast – have claimed he was “furious”. Kensington Palace aides were quick to suggest his feelings were out of concern for his brother and Meghan.  An emotional Meghan spoke in the show of the “really challenging” time of being a new mother in the spotlight, saying: “It’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.” The day after it aired, William was said to be “worried” about the couple and “hoped they were alright”. But Foster today revealed his source said “palace leaks” had driven “hysteria” over Harry’s comments. Harry and Meghan have had mixed responses to the documentary.    In the film, a subdued Meghan said pregnancy is a “vulnerable” time and not many people had asked after her wellbeing. She added she had “tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stf upper lip” but was left feeling hurt over negative coverage they received. Harry told of the stress of public le too, revealing his mental health is under “constant management”. The Duke and Duchess have also been widely criticised for certain lestyle choices over the past year. They were accused of hypocrisy over their decision to use private jets while campaigning about climate change.    And they have been affected by the behaviour of Meghan’s estranged dad Thomas, who has given embarrassing interviews in a bid to heal their rt. The -year-old failed to attend her wedding last May after he was caught colluding with paparazzi. Sadly, she has not seen Thomas since before her big day and he has yet to meet her five-month-old son Archie. But Meghan has also been accused of playing the media – with claims she briefed friends to speak to reporters.    In February, five close pals “opened up” on the woman they “know and love” after her fallout with Thomas. The interview, painting Meghan in a hugely positive light, described her as a “selfless friend who writes thank-you notes for reasons big and small”. Meanwhile, Meghan was all smiles at tonight’s One Young World Summit bash. She wowed in a violet Aritzia Babaton Maxwell dress as she was greeted by Royal Albert Hall president Ian McCullough and the group’s managing director, Ella Robertson.

We often get to see a small selection of her proud collection in one of the reception rooms in Buckingham Palace when she hosts special guests there and shares official photos from the occasion. The photos are often moved around and rearranged, but photos of Princes Charles, William and Harry with their wives are always in pride of place. However in the most recent snap taken in her luxurious living room the photo of Harry and Meghan Markle has vanished from itaposs usual spot. Back when the Monarch met Boris Johnson when he became Prime Minister in July, we could clearly see a shot believed to be from their engagement photoshoot.  However it wasnapost one of the set officially released to celebrate their happy news, so fans were very excited to see the new image. It shows Meghan in a blue dress and normally sits in a simple silver frame. Kate and Williamaposs photo is also from their engagement shoot, and sits just behind in a wooden frame.  Some people have suggested that this may be to protect them after their recent documentary, in which they spoke openly about their struggles with royal le. However itaposs likely to be that the Queen has just rearranged the photos and has decided to put it where, and photos from dferent angles at other events show she has an entire desk of photos directly in her eyeline. She has a piece of paper and her glasses where the photo used to sit, so she might have just decided she needed a bit more free space.    Royal fans love spotting all the photos in the Queenaposs home, but during her meeting with Boris there was something  that really caught their eye.

The -year-old ate around £,-worth of take out a year, and would even have two dinners a night. Chy, from Cumbernauld, Scotland, was so unhappy from a previous relationship she would eat curries, Big Macs and chip shop dinners to deal with her problems. After ballooning to a size  and weighing st, she claims she struggled to walk just a few steps - and couldnapost even tie her shoelaces as her waistline expanded.    Struggling to shed two stone on her own, Chy was referred for a gastric sleeve on the NHS. The health and social care student eventually ended her dead-end relationship and in May , she met her new husband Owen, , on Plenty of Fish. With his support, she has transformed her le. The loved-up pair tied the knot this summer, as the new confident Chy beamed in a size  dress - after halving her body weight to st. She said: Wearing my wedding dress after losing all that weight felt amazing. I was so surprised when it fit. Being told I looked stunning all day took a bit of getting used to, to be honest. After being in a one-sided relationship for years, I felt really proud of myself. Before I couldnapost walk even a few steps. I can even tie my shoelaces again. I can now walk without turning red and getting out of breath.    I saved myself from a heart attack. Iaposm ashamed [of how I used to be]. Now, I feel like a normal person again and have such a healthier le. Feeling unhappy in her relationship, Chy had binged on Indian takeaways and chocolate - spending up to £ a day on greasy meals. But as a newly single woman in May , Chy did try to lose weight - though shedding just two stone in a year. And when her obesity left her unable to walk just a few steps, she had a gastric sleeve fitted in September . As the months passed, she saw the weight melt away and before she knew it, she was ordering a size  wedding dress - something she never dreamt was possible.    Three weeks before her wedding in July this year, she was amazed to try on the beautul gown and feel it slip over her slim frame - excitedly sending it off for alterations. Chy said: My wedding dress was ordered from America and it arrived just four weeks before the wedding. It was altered around three weeks before the big day to a size . On the day I felt amazing. I have much more self worth. Now I have the support of a wonderful husband and feel a lot better about myself. The surgery changed a lot. Iaposve got the support I need now and I know anything is possible.    I had to re-program my brain when it came to food and Iaposve learnt a lot. Iaposm at my target weight now and will be keeping at it. When she first started her search of love more than a year ago, Chy never imagined she would be settling down into married le already. But she admits finding love and being able to rely on Owen possibly saved her le. Chy said: I have always had problems with my weight and due to the situation with my ex, it was made worse. The relationship triggered me to put on weight.

Paige Hoyle, , grabbed Victoria Wynn by the hair and punched in the face up to five times in a street brawl, started after Hoyle hurled a bottle at the victim. The victim needed treatment for nerve damage and swelling to her face. A court heard Miss Wynn, who is in her s, huddled her sobbing child and begged for mercy - but Hoyle, herself a mother-of-three, retorted: Who the f*** are you  and promptly subjected her to the vicious beating. But judge Recorder Matthew Corbett-Jones stressed violent Hoyle has responsibility of three young children and spared her jail.    Sentencing the lout to a -month community order at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, the judge said: This was a sustained and repeated assault. You had consumed alcohol and there is an ongoing impact. This took place in the presence of a child. You started this incident and had it not been for your actions, this simply would not have happened. She would not have sustained her injuries. It is apparent you were in a state of turmoil because of events in the past, which led to a falling out with your father. You have had subsequent traumatic incidents in your le and you do have responsibility of three young children. The judge made his decision after Hoyleaposs lawyer argued the defendantaposs kids aged six, four and nine months depended on her and claimed it was not in the public interest to send her to prison.    Harriet Johnson, defending, said: She does show unusual insight into the impact this will have on the woman and child. She has three children aged six, four and nine months of her own who depend on her. However, they will not in anyway get her out of jail. She has made arrangements in respect of them and she knows custody is inevitable. She doesnapost seem to rely on the children to keep her out of prison. She knows she must be punished for what she has done and she reacted wrongly. But there is a keenness to engage with probation and I would submit it is not the best thing to send her to custody, as it is not in the public interest. She is in receipt of benefits. She has suffered financially also.  But Hoyle, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, faced up to five years jail after she admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The fracas happened after the pair left a New Yearaposs party in Rochdale. The defendant had become involved in an altercation with her partner and partneraposs dad moments before the rage.

If you feel like youaposve exhausted every option, one mumaposs brilliant reward system might be worth a go - and all you need are a few cheap containers and a whiteboard. Mum-of-three Shelley Kozyra seems to have found a hack to not only encourage her two sons and daughter to help with tasks like cleaning their rooms and hoovering, but also to follow her rules on behaviour.In a post on Facebook , she shared her system requiring her children to earn tokens to exchange for special rewards.   With a whiteboard setting out the house rules and chores, thereaposs also a section for each child with what they have achieved that week. Each task or good behaviour earns Nate, Isaac and Leah tokens made from laminated happy faces, which are placed in adorable personalised buckets attached to the board. Shelley wrote: Full-time work and being mum to my beautul three little ones Mr , Mr  and Miss  is busy and need all the help we can get. Aim is to work towards a number of tokens that they put in the buckets and trade-in for something they would really like.    When they collect enough tokens, they can be cashed in for outings to the movies, dinner, one-on-one time, extended bedtime, screen time or something from the shops. The board shows Nate and Isaac had already helped out their mum cleaning rooms, putting in bin liners and getting off the iPad when asked. It sets out which areas of the house the boys will be responsible for but it appears two-year-old Leah is exempt from the dirty work for now. The trio can also earn tokens for behaving well, such as keeping their hands to themselves, using nice words and doing as they are told.

times a year while the rest of the time it’s something  other than a stadium for football – which is obviously most of the time.“We want the football fans to have the best possible time they can, but the other  days, we want everyone  that comes on the site to say ‘this is a great place to be, I want to go back there’.“That’s what we want to happen.”The development and construction of the project itself has been frustrating for Nelms and Dundee owner Tim Keyes, the men behind Dark Blue Property Holdings, which is driving the new stadium plans.In terms of the here and now, Nelms admits development of the project has slowed down.Lending partners have been identied and Nelms is working closely with them to find a way forward.He said: “As soon as we get confirmation of a plan of how financing will work and it works for us, we’ll press the button and all the consultants and everybody are back up to speed.“Gregor Hamiltonis patiently waiting for these documents to come through.“Because it’s so large and has so many dferent parts, our consultants have been working with the council to give them the workings in stages.“That will be based on how we’ve agreed to drop them in and ensure it’s the way they want it done.“In our pre-meetings, which were over a year ago, we met with neighbours and local groups as well as those who had concerns.“All of those things have happened – though it feels like a long, long time ago.”Nelms sees the prospect of bringing the stadium to Dundee, on land next to Dundee Ice Arena, as the next stage of the city’s re-birth.He has watched, since arriving in , the Waterfront development and the city as a whole growing as time goes on.He is sure a new stadium complex will bring in even more tourism.Nelms believes it’s important to build on the positivity surrounding Dundee by helping produce a venue hosting events which would attract people from all around Scotland.“You have to have momentum, you can’t rest on your laurels, you’ve got to build around that and add more to Dundee,” he said.“You want people to spend the night here, spend more money so we have to give them multiple things.“That’s one of our goals. Dundee is on the up and that’s one of the reasons we invested initially. When I first arrived the Waterfront was all rubble, it was hard to see it was a city on the up. But now the Waterfront is fantastic.“The focus can’t just be there, it has to be in the city centre and surrounding areas.“We need to build Dundee into a place where people want to spend more than a couple of hours.”More than  jobs could be created by a new stadium at Camperdown Park.Dundee managing director John Nelms has revealed government predictions suggest Dundonians could benefit from hundreds of jobs thanks to the project.He said: “All of these things, the hotel, the restaurants, the crematorium all bring jobs. “according to government documents, it brings about  full time jobs.#It also brings, over a two-three year period, construction jobs and part-time jobs.#It creates more opportunity for the city and that’s our goal.”Nelms also hopes a new stadium can help bring top music acts to Dundee and help Slessor Gardens to carry the load – as well as a conference centre which can attract , guests. He added:“We can have concerts for up to , at slessor Gardens but we’d like to have concerts which host , people. That means we can bring acts to Dundee which would pass us over on a regular basis.“We’ll have conference space which can offer -, spaces and that’s what we want to go after.#John Nelms insists Dundee are in the process of recovering after relegation last season.The managing director says changes behind the scenes have seen the club moving in a dferent direction, after the appointments of James McPake as manager and Gordon Strachan as technical director.He said: “The Championship has been a big change, luckily we planned for some change and it has allowed us to move a few things around the club.“Obviously the manager has changed, we’re changing things in the academy by bringing Gordon in and once we got through all the negativity of being relegated we could focus on bringing the club back up again.“I think we’ve done that. We have a young manager and he has a lot of good people around him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street is shankland here to stay and can dundee do dens double","story":"This week Tele sports reporters George Cran, Calum Woodger and Graeme Finnan discuss whether Lawrence Shankland has done enough to be Scotland’s No , can Dundee win back-to-back for the first time and what has Calum got against Robert Snodgrass Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.4369805-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.4369805-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.4369805-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.4369805-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Entry to this competition is by registering online only.

to Russia in Moscow and beat San Marino - at Hampden in Euro  qualying Group I.To make his Dark Blue bow was a boost, as he had come so close in the past.Reds boss McInnes was thrilled to see Devlin finally win caps for Scotland and hopes his stopper can add to them and establish himself with the national team in the same way as McKenna, his Pittodrie colleague.McKenna missed out on the last squad, having just ed from a hamstring injury, but having made his debut in March of last year, the -year-old has gone on to win  caps and become a mainstay of the Scotland defence.McInnes said of Devlin’s first two Scotland appearances: “It was two games that were in total contrast to each other.“Steve had indicated in conversations with me that he was going to cap Mikey.“It was a dficult start for him against Russia. The team had to pick themselves up from the disappointment when the game ended.“There was the high of getting his first cap, but then the disappointment of how it turned out.“However, the reaction was good from everyone, including Mikey, against San Marino.“I’m sure that lted Mikey, but it also lted the supporters of the Scotland team.“So it was good that Mikey had a convincing win and it was good he got the opportunity to go back into the team again after losing against Russia.“Certainly he came back in last Tuesday feeling good about himself and rightly so.“To get a couple of caps is great and he will see it now as a chance to establish himself in the national team in the way McKenna has done.”Former Hamilton Accies man Devlin was named in Clarke’s previous two squads, in September and June, but didn’t feature in two clashes against Belgium and encounters with Russia and Cyprus.Last season, after a bright start to the campaign with Aberdeen, he looked set to be handed his Scots debut by Gothenburg Great Alex McLeish in the Uefa Nations League double header with Albania and Israel in November.However, a foot injury sustained during training with the national team meant he missed out.That injury ended up keeping Devlin out for three months last season and after he ed to action with the Dons he struggled to recapture his early-season form.McInnes added: “He got injured away with Scotland and after that he really struggled to get any momentum again.“Mikey is someone who is hungry to get more caps and I’m sure the two caps he’s had will help that in terms of trying to get into future squads.”Devlin’s two caps were contrasting encounters.In the first, against Russia, he was up against prolic Zenit St Petersburg striker Artem Dzyuba, who scored twice as Russia thrashed the Scots -.But three days later, at Hampden, Devlin was rarely tested defensively against minnows San Marino.McInnes believes Devlin will feel the benefit of both games in his future development.He said: “Whether you see it immediately or not, I think you always get a benefit from playing with your national team.“Whether it’s a good experience or a bad experience, I think it makes you better.“He’s had to play against Russia and be asked the question a lot by a physical striker and then play against a team in San Marino where he didn’t have a lot to do defensively.“It was more about his use of the ball, which was good, as was his concentration. Mikey has sampled two dferent ends of the spectrum in international football and it’s pleasing he managed to deal with that.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.4369805-240x180.jpg

Council has announced plans to introduce an appointment system for local authority offices.Residents can currently just turn up at facilities to speak to customer service advisors to discuss council tax issues, parking permits or get advice on benefits.However, a new system will be introduced next month for people who need information on services to book appointments online.Only customers who need urgent help from staff will still be able to use the drop-in service to speak to advisors in council buildings.Appointments will need to be made to discuss issues relating to council tax, housing benefit, the Accord card and permits at the Marischal College customer centre from November .Customers will also need to book ahead for sessions at the Mastrick and Woodside housing offices and the Tillydrone Community Campus from November .Advice on housing, money, temporary accommodation, blue badges, adult social care and licensing will only be given to people booking appointments from December .They can be booked for a range of times throughout the day and Aberdeen City Council’s website will be updated when appointments are available.Until each of the relevant dates, the centres will still use a drop-in service.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “As more of our customers are requesting support and services online, we have recently introduced a facility for people to book appointments online for some services.“This has proved highly successful as some customers much prefer having an appointment time rather than queuing and waiting to speak with a member from one of our teams.“Our staff at these customer service points will also be able to assist anyone trying to book an appointment and we will still continue to offer support for any customer that needs help urgently and is unable to make an appointment.”Anyone seeking help can also get access to online services  hours a day, seven days a week using a computer, tablet or smartphone.Advice can be sought online on a range of dferent issues, including information on the Scottish Welfare Fund.Customers can also use the site to report a change of circumstances relating to housing benefit and council tax

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness.

Oklahoma will be reborn for the third time on the Memorial Hall stage, by a young cast saddling up and taking the reins of their second show. Peeblesshire News reporter Hilary Scott joined the hoedown rehearsal last Wednesday and spoke with the cast as they prepared for the upbeat cowboy classic.Rodgers and Hammersteinrsquos collaboration is uniquely adapted for youth performers who are working hard to bring you a rootinrsquo tootinrsquo, chap-slapping show.It comes from the prodigies of Innerleithen Opera, who last year brought the rags to riches tale of orphan Annie to le.The success of their debut performance led to calls for another show, and the young actors from KIYT jumped at the chance to take to the stage again.They are stepping back to a time before any of them were born. Set in the Western Indian Territory just after the turn of the th century, the spirited rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys provides the backdrop for a love story between Curly, a handsome cowboy, and Laurey, a beautul farm girl.But the road to true love is a bumpy one, especially as sinister farm-hand Jud Fry has his sights set on Laurey, and hersquoll do whatever it takes to get her.But Laurey isnrsquot the only girl in Oklahoma with cowboy troubles. Her ditzy friend Ado Annie just loves it when a fella talks purty to her! Shersquos taken up with the Peddler man who doesnrsquot want her.Meanwhile cowboy Will Parker desperately wants the irrepressible Annie to be his bride. But for him its lsquoall of nothinrsquo. However, Ado Annie has just one problem when shersquos with a fella ndash lsquoshe canrsquot say no!rsquoRiding ahead of the herd of romanticised cowboy land is Laureyrsquos wise-cracking Aunt Eller. If anyone can sort out the messy love triangle itrsquos her.As rehearsals get under way in the Library Hall Irsquom at a loose end until I can grab some of the principals for a chat.Deep within this building is the most magical wardrobe, which has been bringing characters to le in many a show performed by Innerleithen and District Operatic Society.Seamstresses Rhona McGlasson and Susan McGinn have been working the needle and thread for more years than they care to remember, but they tell me itrsquos ldquoplaytime to them, and they are often scouring charity shops for bargains.I cast my eye over the checks, neck scarfs, and long floral dresses. ldquoThe youngsters love trying on their costumes, says Rhona. ldquoItrsquos like playing dressing up.Between scenes I catch up with some of the cast. First up was Curlyhis rival Jud Fryand Andrew Carnes .Itrsquos Finrsquos first show with KIYT and hersquos looking forward to playing the lovelorn cowboy. ldquoI was hoping to play Curly, hersquos a kind guy with a big heart. Rehearsals are fun, I enjoy acting with everyone. They are a great group of people.Oliver is playing Ado Anniersquos protective father Andrew Carnes, who doesnrsquot want cowboy Will Parker to marry his daughter.ldquoHe is a bold character and fatherly figure, said Oliver. ldquoIrsquom working on the accent, itrsquos going pretty well.And the most feared character is Jud Fry, played by Nathan Pirie. I have to say, he didnrsquot strike me as the typical villain. That was until I saw him in action during rehearsal!ldquoIrsquove always wanted to be an actor and be the bad guy, he said. ldquoI have to put on quite a low voice for my character. Hersquos a dark person. Irsquom looking forward to the wedding scene when I have a fight with Curly.This yearrsquos leading lady is Neve Scott, who last year made her debut performance with KIYT as the con-woman Lily St Regis in Annie.Neve played the ditsy, whiney floozy, but this year will grace this stage as the head-strong farm girl Laurey, who secretly loves Curly.She said: ldquoThis role is the complete opposite to the character I played last year which is great. I have some fantastic solos and I have been working on expanding my vocals to hit the powerful notes. I love having to put on an accent and Irsquove been working hard to perfect it. The whole cast are great and I canrsquot wait to perform with them.Angela Grant is new to KIYT and has landed the role of the feisty Aunt Eller. ldquoI watched the film but I really started to like my character when we began rehearsing. Itrsquos my first acting role and Irsquom enjoying being part of a musical theatre group. When all the cast get together for scenes therersquos a great atmosphere.I caught up with George Brydon who is saddling up to play cowboy Will Parker. ldquoI feel very excited to play Will because hersquos a happy-go-lucky sort of guy with some sick moves, and Irsquom looking forward to learning the two-step. Irsquom loving being in Oklahoma. Itrsquos a great show with classic songs.Unfortunately I didnrsquot get the chance to catch all the cast ndash perhaps Ado Annie was too busy to peel herself away from the smooth-talking cowboys!I did, however, sneak a peek at the auction scene being rehearsed. Whilst bids of dollars, saddles and even a horse are being hollered, I make my bid and buy a ticket for this show, because this cast are doing grand in Oklahoma and theyrsquore gonna treat you great!Tickets for the shows on November ,  and  are now available from the Thrt Shop or The Hub in Innerleithen, Graham McGrathrsquos, Peebles, www.idas.org.uk booking@idaos.org.uk, Facebook inneropera, or by phoning  ."},{"url":null,"title":"end-era","story":"FOR one night, and one night only, Billy Connolly is gting us one last laugh in an exclusive screening of his last tour.Filmed during the final leg of his Australia tour in , The Sex Le of Bandagesis a stark reminder of Connollys hilarity and humanity.Viewers arent just shown Billy in his natural habitat of the stand-up stage, we also get an eye opening look into his personal le since his Parkinsons Disease diagnosis in .

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope.

Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council.

mimics photosynthesis, the process plants use to gather energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide and water.At present, a gas known as syngas is produced from fossil fuels, but the new carbon-neutral solution that has been drawn up by scientists could eventually be used to develop a sustainable liquid fuel alternative to petrol.Professor Erwin Reisner and his team have managed to ensure the device does not release any additional carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.ldquoYou may not have heard of syngas itself, but every day you consume products that were created using it, explained Professor Reisner, from Cambridgersquos Department of Chemistry, a senior author of the research.ldquoBeing able to produce it sustainably would be a critical step in closing the global carbon cycle and establishing a sustainable chemical and fuel industry.The generating capacity of photosynthesis is huge.It is thought that the average rate of energy capture through the process globally is approximately  terawatts.This is roughly eight times the current power consumption of the worlds human population.Scientists say they have managed to make their articial leaf sustainable unlike others in the past because of the combination of materials and catalysts they used.The overall process is achieved using two light absorbers, similar to the molecules in plants that harvest sunlight, which are combined with a catalyst made from cobalt.When in water, one light absorber uses the catalyst to produce oxygen, while the other carries out the chemical reaction that reduces carbon dioxide and water into carbon monoxide and hydrogen, forming the syngas mixture.What is more, the articial leaf is able to work just as well on cloudy and overcast days.ldquoThis means you are not limited to using this technology just in warm countries, or only operating the process during the summer months, said Virgil Andrei, a PhD student and first author of the paper, published in the Nature Materials journal.ldquoYou could use it from dawn until dusk, anywhere in the world.He added: ldquoWe are aiming at sustainably creating products such as ethanol, which can readily be used as a fuel.ldquoItrsquos challenging to produce it in one step from sunlight using the carbon dioxide reduction reaction.ldquoBut we are confident that we are going in the right direction, and that we have the right catalysts, so we believe we will be able to produce a device that can demonstrate this process in the near future.Professor Reisner continued: ldquoWhat wersquod like to do next, instead of first making syngas and then converting it into liquid fuel, is to make the liquid fuel in one step from carbon dioxide and water.ldquoThere is a major demand for liquid fuels to power heavy transport, shipping and aviation sustainably.The development of the articial leaf at Cambridge University comes after it was reported previously that scientists were attempting to mimic the way plants harness energy from the sun in order to make a more efficient renewable fuel.Researchers at the University of East Angliaembarked on an pound, project to replicate photosynthesis.Scientists said the process would be used to create hydrogen, which can be used as a zero-emission fuel for cars, or converted into green electricity.It is hoped the method, which involves placing tiny solar  on microbes to harness sunlight and drive the production of hydrogen, will be a more efficient way of converting the suns energy than currently exists.The UEA, who is leading the project, said: \"Reserves of fossil fuels are dwindling and fuel prices are rising, so its really vital that we look to renewable energy supplies.\"Many renewable energy supplies such as sunlight, wind and the waves still remain largely untapped resources.\"Cambridge and Leeds universities were also involved in that project."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburghs-most-sought-after-apartments-help-housebuilder-cala-record-sales","story":"The company said a strong summer performance and a broad range of homes available

When askedthere was a new Scottish independence referendum tomorrow should Scotland stay in the UK, .% said Remain, with .% plumping for Leave with around % either undecided or refused to register a decision.Last week, Scotlands first minister insisted that a legal referendum is the only way for the country to win independence.She dismissed claims that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in a general election would be enough for independence to be declared.There was \"no easy or shortcut route to independence\" and that a future referendum had to be \"beyond any doubt in terms of its legitimacy\".:Ian Blackford says Scottish independence vote has to happen next yearBut she insisted that independence was now closer than ever.She has repeatedly said she wants to hold a second referendum on independence next year - but the move has been ruled out by the UK government.The latest Survation poll of , people aged over  in Scotland also revealed some % agree that Brexit makes independence more likely - showing no change from March.When Scots were askedthe UK leaves the EU without a deal, would they be more likely to vote for independence in a future referendum, % agreed in that latest poll, up from % in March.According to the latest poll, more than half of Scotsthink there will be another vote on independence within the next two years -arise from the % who believed that in March.The Survation polls on support or otherwise for Scottish independence for Progress Scotland did not seek a straight Remain or Leave option. Instead, voters were asked to provide a depth of feeling about independence or staying part of the Union using a scale from zero to ten.The analysisfalls more in line with the Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times Scotland which last weekfound support for Scottish independence had risen to %.The % figure backing independence marks a five point increase on the % Panelbase registered on average in its polls last year, which mirrored the % yes % no result of the  independence referendum.Angus Robertson, the former leader of the SNPs Westminister group in Parliament, who is the managing director of Progress Scotland, said after some of thelatestpoll results were producedon its website: ldquoThese poll results show that Brexit is having a major impact on general public opinion on the timing of a second independence referendum, and particularly on swing voters who are open-minded or undecided on Scottish independence.ldquoA clear majority believe that Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely and that their views have changed about Scottish independence.\"The Press Association previously reported that the Progress Scotland poll showed that Scots are \"more likely to have shted towards remaining part of the UK rather than backing Scottish independence\".Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins had said when the original figures - that came without the March comparisons - were revealed: \"Its no wonder these independence campaigners want to keep the results of this poll quiet.\"Progress Scotland arent usually slow to trumpet their findings so its interesting that theyve been so secretive about this particular survey.\"Like the vast majority of polls, it reveals again that more Scots want to remain in the UK than to leave it.\"And, far from gaining momentum, it seems the Yes campaign is losing supporters at a higher rate than its gaining them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-economy--3bn-smaller-due-brexit-worse-come","story":"The Fraser of Allander Institute today says agreeing a Brexit deal will help in the short-term, but warns Boris Johnsonrsquos plans ldquocould be even more challenging than Theresa Mayrsquos in the long-term.In its latest Economic Commentary, the Institute also scolded politicians for dumbing down the debate on Scotlandrsquos economy by conducting it in soundbites.It criticised those erting attention from sluggish growth by ldquoblaming Brexit or asserting that further constitutional change will solve all our challenges.It said the debate and policy development on climate change at Holyrood had been far more impressive, with Scotland now regarded as a world leader on the issue.:No-deal Brexit will be catastrophic for Scotlands economyHowever, it warned the radical changes required to avert disaster would require a degree of global ldquoinvestment and economic planning not seen the Second World War, with many steps dficult and politically unpopular.On Brexit, todayrsquos report says the economy is around  per cent smaller than it would otherwise have been had the UK voted to Remain in .Investment has been the worst hit area of economic growth, with businesses delaying decisions until after Brexit or cancelling them, it said.

Cycling Scotland, Cycling UK, Forth Environment Link, Living Streets, Paths for All, Ramblers Scotland, Sustrans Scotland and Transform Scotlandrsquos six point plan said journeys on foot, bike and public transport should be prioritised over cars, to help tackle inequality, reduce carbon emissions and improve health and wellbeing.As well as an end to government investment in the creation of new trunk roads, theorganisations have made a number of what they believe are progressive suggestions for the way forward.They include: taking space from private vehicles to make more room for walking and segregated cycling investing in affordable and integrated public transport and ensuring all housing, commercial and retail developments include measures to promote ldquoactive travel in any new proposals.They go on to suggest supporting ldquobehaviour change programmes which encourage active and sustainable travel and improving access to bikes.Sustrans deputy CEO John Lauder said the new National Transport Strategy rightly highlighted the role transport can play in health and wellbeing.ldquoWe know that walking, cycling and public transport are best placed to deliver the aims of the new strategy, and these six priorities should be the focus to make it a success, he said.ldquoThis includes an end to expensive new road building schemes in order to tackle the climate emergency ndash this money can be better spent on sustainable, healthy alternatives. Clara Walker, executive director of Forth Environment Link, said the better the transport options, the more likely people were to leave their vehicles at home.ldquoBy continuing to strengthen our National cycling and walking ambitions we will not only see improvements to our environment but also to public health, she said.ldquoBy increasing opportunities and funding for cycling and walking alongside improvements in the public transport network we will support our communities to make affordable and informed choices around how they travel.ldquoThose particularly in rural communities who experience higher public transport costs, will be able to look at multiple modes of transport as a real possibility and leave the car at home.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, called for ldquobold leadership and culture change as part of a rethinking of investment in transportation in Scotland.He said: ldquoItrsquos essential that these are more than wise words in a wellcrafted strategy.The Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed National Transport Strategy sets out the vision for transport in Scotland for the next  years.It includes a ldquosustainable travel hierarchy, which is the system by which dferent modes of transport should be prioritised. However RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said many people would continue to rely on cars for work, shopping, school runs and visiting family.ldquoOur research shows three-quartersof Scottish drivers surveyed by the RAC said they would find it hard to adjust their lestyle to being without a car. If Scotland was no longer to invest in new road infrastructure, communities could become cut off, congestion would increase, he said.A Transport Scotland spokesperson said:ldquoThe Scottish Government is fully committed to delivering a sustainable, healthier, fairer and more accessible transport system as outlined in our draft National Transport Strategy which identies the challenges and sets our vision for the future.\"Walking, cycling, shared and public transport options are key parts of our future vision and we expect our doubled investment in new infrastructure will make active travel a more attractive option than the car for everyday short journeys and as part of a public transport journey,improving health and well-being in the process."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-stop-snobbish-popular-culture-like-avengers","story":"For those who donrsquot know the original ndash which also became a big-budget film ndash it was one of the first comic books widely accepted as serious literature, something it did by subverting all the tropes of the superhero genre.Not everyone seems able to accept that serious art can be made about people in capes or masks or with supernatural abilities ndash even though that would appear to rule out Sophocles, Homer and Shakespeare. The objections donrsquot apply to them, of course. But superhero films, as the directors Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and Ken Loach recently complained, are not so much Juvenal as juvenile.As with all debates these days, itrsquos become intemperate: Scorsese merely said that Marvel films, while ldquofun and good in the way an amusement ride is, were not ldquomy kind of thing Coppola claimed they were ldquodespicable Loach, naturally, thinks that they are a ldquocommodity cynically made for ldquogiant corporations to make a profit.Naturally, since Loach thinks that about everything, from cars to clothes to chicken nuggets everything, that is, except his own film, which always heroically depicts the working class being shafted by the capitalist system, and is presumably produced in order to lose money, since profit is such a bad thing.The only puzzle is how hersquos managed to make around  versions of it and become the most successful director in the history of the Cannes Film Festival without making any money.The truth, of course, is that you would have a better chance of a percentageon your money on a Ken Loach picture than by sinking it into a tentpole blockbuster. Itrsquos certainly less risky: I, Daniel Blake, about a man who dies after his benefits are stopped , brought in  million at the box office alone no one knows quite what it cost, but probably less than pound million, and about a quarter of that was given to Loach in government grants and tax breaks.By contrast, X-Men: Dark Phoenix cost  million, and is expected to lose about  million overall. But thatrsquos capitalism for you, cynically pursuing profit by funding heartbreaking socialist narratives of neoliberal oppression, while throwing money down the stank to bring you Sophie Turner and Jenner Lawrence as sexy mutants in spandex.As it happens, I think Scorsesersquos Goodfellas, Coppolarsquos The Conversation and Loachrsquos Kes are better films than Joss Whedonrsquos Avengers Assemble . But this is not an especially controversial view. There is a tendency, in all the arts, for some work to be marked as ldquoserious and lesser work as ldquoentertainment.High art is better than low art, but the genre ision is nonsense. Those ldquoserious films are genre films, too: Goodfellasare gangster movies, The Conversation is a paranoid conspiracy theory, like Tony Scottrsquos blockbuster Enemy of the State, and Kes is a coming-of-age tale. These are all forms as established, and with rules as clear, as science fiction, Western, war, horror, rom-com or superhero pictures.ldquoLiterary fiction, of the sort that makes the Booker prize shortlist, is as much a genre as space opera or detective fiction indeed, it sometimes is one of those, even when it wonrsquot admit it. Margaret Atwood used to protest furiously that she didnrsquot write science fiction .The ldquoliterary quality of Iain Banksrsquo ldquomainstream books is not notably dferent from Iain M Banksrsquo science fiction. The fact that William McIlvanney and Ian Rankinrsquos subject is crime and detection does not impede their reception as serious fiction. If Cormac McCarthy is a better writer than JT Edson, they are nonetheless both authors of Westerns. Donald E Westlakersquos thrillersare recognisably in the same vein as The Count of Monte Cristo or works about revenge by the likes of Euripides, Webster or Shakespeare.New forms of consuming media have led to much wider availability of every possible form of art ndash think of whole TV channels devoted to classic film, instant access to almost any music on streaming devices, and the digital reproduction of the entire history of Western visual art.Itrsquos also led to catholic tastes and surprising crossovers: Philip Glass creating symphonies from David Bowiersquos rock music modern retellings of classic novels new visual responses to classical painting postmodern architecture period films with pop soundtracks .Itrsquos rather a shame that it hasnrsquot led to a reduction of the snobbish tendency to cram things into genres to be elevated or deplored, when the best works of art are about breaking out of, or transcending, such categories.If Aeschylusrsquos Prometheus Unbound is greater than Kenneth Branaghrsquos Thor , itrsquos not because of the subject matter: theyrsquore both tales of gods and heroes."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A happy day for equality  but a sad day for the Union","story":"The reason for breaking the shameful deadlock that has put democracy on hold for three years was not to pick up business where they left off, nor to attempt to bridge the irreconcilable gulf between warring parties, but to block one of the most signicant pieces of legislation to be passed in Belfast in years.Pro-choice campaigners, and hundreds of thousands of women across the country, won a victory on Monday.

Thi is a party that likes to say lsquonorsquo, he argues. ldquoIt can be persuaded to say yes only when someone asks whether it would like to spend some public money.There are three main options to the Ireland problem, he points out: create a hard border, keep the whole UK in the EU customs area for the time being, or agree a compromise in which Northern Ireland remains aligned more closely with the EU and put checks in place between it and the rest of the UK.ldquoThose... are the only options. And the DUP has rejected all of them. It has said no to a hard border, no to the May deal and is now saying no to the Johnson deal.ldquoIt has abstained on no-deal, presumably worried thatit said lsquonorsquo to no-deal then the double negative might mean that it had accidentally said lsquoyesrsquo to something.The DUP said no to the  Sunningdale Agreement, no to the  Anglo-Irish agreement and to the Good Friday agreement, Finkelstein argues. ldquoIT also said no to abortion, no to gay rights, even no to rock music.His conclusion  ldquoThese are the people to whom the mathematics of the Commons has given such great leverage. But do any of us have to like it  No.The Daily MailAndrew Pierce considers the resistance to Boris Johnsonrsquos ambition to hold a general election, in the light of the fact that MPs have swapped parties or allegiances since the last national poll. The fact that they were elected on s they no longer hold to means it is not surprising so many are lsquododging votersrsquo, he alleges, listing a host of MPs with narrow majorities who might expect to lose their seats.One group of MPs has no such reluctance, he adds: ldquoThey are the Scottish Nationalists. Riding high in the polls, they stand to gain  seats on current standings, Pierce says. He adds that the SNP has another motive for seeking an early election: Alex Salmondrsquos trial expected in January, on a series of charges including sexual misconduct allegations. ldquoSalmond has strenuously denied all the claims against him but the party fears the effect of any bad publicity.What of the Lib Dems  On the face of it they want to revoke Article  and cancel Brexit. ldquoRealistically the only way that could happen isthe Lib Dems get a parliaemntary majority - and the only way of possibly achieving that pipe-dream is with a general election.Even buoyed by defections pollsters rate their chances of a majority are slim, he says. ldquoThat is why... Swinson and her Lib Dems are pushing hard for a second referendum as the best way to halt Brexit.For Mr Johnson, calculations about the level of support he can count on are complicated further, according to Jonathan Freedland. Surely those who voted for the WAB are on his side  Not at all: ldquoMPs simply voted for it to receive a second reading, some of them motivated by the desire not to endorse it but to amend it. As Labourrsquos Gloria De Piero confessed, she voted yes, ldquonot because I support the deal but because I donrsquot.This explains the Prime Ministerrsquos decision to lsquopausersquo his bill rather than set a slower timetable, Freedland claims. The ldquothreadbare coalition backing it will unravel when the detail is examined. ldquoThe truth is, Johnson will never have a bigger vote for his deal in this House of Commons than the one he assembled tonight. It will only get smaller. No wonder he had to pause.The Daily Another key player is John Bercow, who as speaker of the House of Commons is meant to be impartial.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amHydrogen achievements in Orkney are in the spotlight as the finalists for the Scottish Green Energy Awards  are announced.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Customers travelling from Kirkwall will now be able to fly to destinations such as Exeter, Norwich and Southampton with just one ticket.Loganair and Flybe routes to and from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Manchester – the five main airports where the airlines’ networks meet – are included. According to the companies, this means that customers making a single booking for a connecting journey between Flybe and Loganair flights will be  check-in bags right through to their final destination with the assurance that they will be re-booked to their destination free of chargeweather conditions or other delays lead to missed connections.The airlines have said that the new codeshare agreement also offers a signicant saving for customers as they no longer have to pay the multiple Air Passenger Duty charges they faced previously when buying separate tickets from Loganair and Flybe to build their own connecting itinerary.Alan Tune, Flybe’s director of sales, alliances and strategic partnerships, said: “We are pleased to add Loganair to our ever-increasing list of codeshare partners, offering customers even more flight connection opportunities by linking our route networks.#The new codeshare agreement with our Loganair partner offers unrivalled connectivity between most of the main cities, islands and regions of the UK, and onwards to several key European cities, too.”Jonathan Hinkles, Loganair’s Managing Director, added: “I’m incredibly pleased to be launching this new partnership with Flybe, which will bring tremendous benefits for customers through assured connections, reduced travel costs and convenient through check-in.#The new codeshare agreement will link all of the communities that we’re proud to serve as Scotland’s airline with major destinations throughout the UK and Europe, and I’m sure that this will be fantastic news for UK tourism, business and by making it easier to visit friends and family.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This scheme will include looking at prehistoric seafaring and what the Isles were like thousands of years ago, what travel would have been like between the isles with very dferent sea levels. Shipwrecks will also be considered — uncovering more information about wrecks around the isles, looking at any that might still be unrecorded and sharing anecdotes and stories passed down through families and between friends. One aspect of the project will look at maritime cultural landscapes and how sea links and industries have shaped the character of each isle. Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission. Given the regular dialogue between the Scottish Government and the Commission over the past year, it beggars belief that Ministers should have been caught out in this way.“Meanwhile, businesses and communities in Orkney and Shetland are left wondering when they will ever get clarity over the future of these leline ferry services.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling.The scheme is expected to increase recycling of single-use bottles and cans and cut CO emissions, playing an important role in tackling the climate emergency. It will also give people an extra incentive not to litter.Zero Waste Scotland, who helped the Scottish Government design the scheme, is especially interested to hear from islands-based drinks producers, retailers, hospitality businesses, and other key stakeholders, such as tourism businesses.The draft regulations laid before the Scottish Parliament in September include a target of capturing  per cent of all scheme containers. Achieving that requires making the scheme accessible and practical for everyone in Scotland.In addition to this and six other island engagement events, the Scottish Government will complete an Islands Impact Assessment to ensure that any signicant unique impacts on island communities are captured and mitigated against. A webinar will be held after the final event to give people that could not attend a chance to learn more about the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer, Zero Waste Scotland, said: “We want to make sure that Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme works for the whole of Scotland. That’s why we are visiting Orkney to speak with residents, businesses and stakeholders. We want to benefit from their insight into how this will work for the islands.“Making the scheme a success in Orkney will require dferent approaches from in Scotland’s cities. From logistics and transport, to cash flow and tourism, we look forward to discussing how we can work together to deliver a world-class scheme.”Alastair Nicolson, programme manager at Highlands  Islands Enterprise, said: “This is a very ambitious scheme that aims to make a real dference to people and communities in every part of Scotland.“For the scheme to work effectively, dferent approaches will need to be worked out and applied. Models of recycling that work well in large towns and cities won’t necessarily bring about the desired results in rural areas, including islands and remote mainland communities.“It’s great that the needs of islanders are being recognised at this early stage of the Deposit Return Scheme through this programme of events on the ground and online.”The Orkney engagement event will take place at The Orkney Hotel, Kirkwall, on Thursday October , from am to pm.To sign up to take part, visit http:bit.ly DepositReturnOrkneyA webinar will be hosted by Zero Waste Scotland following its series of island engagement events.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He explained to the Commonsrsquo Transport Select Committee that some hard shoulders on dynamic smart motorways are only open to running traffic during the morning and evening peaks, but this catches out some drivers when their routine changes.ldquoPeople whose normal daily commute takes place at am or am,theyrsquove been to the dentist and come out at am they drive down the hard shoulder, he said.ldquoWhen we close it at other times of the day, people still drive down it.Mr OrsquoSullivan said there is confusion over when the hard shoulder is and is not open to traffic.ldquoWe get people who stop there when itrsquos a running lane, he told the committee.ldquoWhat we also find is because people arenrsquot sureitrsquos a hard shoulder or a running lane, even when it is open, the usage of that running lane is much lower because people arenrsquot sure whether itrsquos a hard shoulder or not.He added: ldquoI donrsquot think we will be building any more dynamic hard shoulder smart motorways.

It does not make economic sense to withdraw our markets in the EU, for the sake of other markets within the USA.

But unfortunately the price tag was unrealistic for most families, with costs of bikes in the thousands.She said: #Shetland Sport for All wants to keep the momentum going in Shetland and help people to access sport and activity no matter what their ability is.#The group is also in the running for a grant through the #Loot for Lerwick# event this coming Saturday.Ms Murray said: #Please head along to Islesburgh between am and noon and vote for their project to help them get funding to have more adapted bikes in the islands.#The aim of Shetland Sport For All is to bridge the gap for people in Shetland living with a disabilityto be able to access sporting activities to encourage and promote the development of sport and physical recreation among disabled people in Shetland to seek to improve the quality of le and health and fitness of disabled people through participation in sport to strengthen and extend the network of contacts, clubs and development groups throughout Shetland andas a branch of Scottish Disability Sport in accordance with the constitution and aims of that body..."},{"url":null,"title":"ofgem rejects shetland subsea cable plan ","story":"Government regulator Ofgem have said they are #unable to approve# plans to build a subsea electricity transmission cable between Shetland and the mainland, in a further blow to the Viking Energy windfarm development.This comes only a month after Viking failed to win government backing in the latest round of Contract for Dference auctions.In a statement released on Wednesday morning, Ofgem announced that the #award of these subsidies would have provided confidence that the wind farm is likely to progress, and protection for consumers from the risk of paying for an underutilised transmission link to the Shetland Isles.#In March, Ofgem said that they were minded to approve the estimated £ million link between Shetland and the mainland.They have said they #would welcome revised proposals from SSEN including providing greater certainty on the future of the windfarms#.This latest setback is also a blow to the proposed Energy Isles  turbine windfarm development in Yell, which is also reliant on a transmission cable between Shetland and the Scottish mainland going ahead. raquoMy goodness, sanity is taking over at last.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

Many of her previous publications topped the book charts in the UK and Ireland, some even making on to the prestigious Sunday Times Best Seller list.In her latest publication, the experienced cook s to her roots with wholesome recipes for easy and affordable meals to suit all occasions - from quick mid-week suppers to the traditional family Sunday lunch.For Jenny, food has come full circle, and her wisdom and advice over her long career has always reflected the needs and trends of society.Since the start of her illustrious career, which has seen her present pioneering television cooking shows, appear at events, establish her cookery school and publish extensively, her personal style has evolved and changed dramatically. Jenny describes her cooking style now as more relaxed and healthier, offering great results with less fuss. She has reflected this approach in her new recipes.Fundamentally, Jenny’s guiding principals have remained the same throughout her career. She wants to empower people to create tasty, wholesome food that brings everyone to the table with a smile on their face.“I have taken familiar recipes and updated them with a modern twist drawing on influences and tastes from the full spectrum of the global cuisine,” Jenny says.“There are few people who don’t appreciate the merits of a Sunday roast dinner, a slice of cake and warm, home-baked bread served with a bowl of soup.“My roots are in the country and in my new book I want people to connect with our world-class, local produce and enjoy the bounty of nature all around us while supporting and strengthening our food infrastructure.“I understand everyone is struggling in these uncertain times. We are all juggling busy schedules, domestic budgeting and a healthy diet, so I have created a collection of streamlined recipes for lighter, fresher dishes that are easy to prepare and heartwarmingly delicious and nutritious.”At Home With Jenny features food for all seasons from Valentine’s Day to Christmas and everything in between.

The PSNI say the device has now been removed for forensic examination to determineit was viable.Mr Carson said those responsible “have no support from the local community”.“Yet again, we can see people’s lives in the heart of West Belfast disrupted,” he said. “What cause this serves, nobody knows. These communities don’t want it – they’ve asked people who are involved in this type of incident to get off their backs and let them live in peace.”Police have appealed to anyone who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact them.

But for every bad news story about young people, there are so many more good news stories with many youngsters going above and beyond for the great of their own community.One such example is a group of girls from New Lodge Youth Centre who have recently embarked on an intergenerational project with elderly people in local nursing homes and accommodated living.An intergenerational project is one designed to help build better relationships between young and old people as well as tackle issues such as bullying and bereavement.The project also creates learning opportunities for the pupils and the elderly, with young people working one-on-one with seniors and asking questions about their childhood, work, hobbies and le in general.Paul Dynes from New Lodge Youth Centre said the intergenerational project came about thanks to their great relationship with Newington Housing Association.“Basically, the project came about after work between the youth centre and Martin Hamilton from Newington Housing Association, who use our building for ious events,” he said. “They have also provided us with support for ious programmes over the last couple of years. From our work together, it sparked an idea of doing some more things together. It was actually a group of young girls that came to one of our youth workers to express a real interest and want to engage with an elderly home or accommodated living or. as it is better known, some sort of intergenerational project.”The project is now in full swing with the girls spending a couple of hours each week engaging with the elderly.“The first session was all about storytelling, sharing experiences and memories before it progressed to taking part in games and activities to spark such conversations between them,” added Paul.“They were able to build up relationships with each other and started to understand more about each other which was key to the rest of the project. Since then, they have done all sorts of things together such as baking and other fun-based activities.“They have recently decided to go on to do a shared-art piece where they will create fashionable dresses to show the evolution of fashion over the years to the modern day.”Paul is now hopeful the project will be something other communities can take note of in order to break the stigma of some young people and elderly folk’s opinions of each other.“I think the bigger issue is that some young people may have views on elderly people and vice-versa.“Some young people get a bad name by causing trouble or engaging in anti-social behaviour and this type of project helps create an understanding of one another.“There is definitely a need for it within our community and indeed, in the wider society.“If there are people and groups who want to make it happen, it certainly can.“I would like to thank Martin Hamilton , James Begleyand everyone at New Lodge Arts and the Ashton Centre for their work and help in making the project happen.”To get involved with New Lodge Youth Centre, contact   "},{"url":null,"title":"farmers kept in dark about trade after brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Chesnutt, from the Ulster Farmers Union, speaking to a Republic of Ireland parliament committee on Britain’s exit from the EU, said it was essential that free-flowing cross-border trade is protected.“The industry is completely integrated, so it goes without saying to rip this apart makes no sense at all,” he told the committee.“We have a deal on the table but we need clarity, for instance Northern Ireland produce processed in the south, can it go out in EU trade deals to the rest of the world “Becauseit can’t, companies in the south might not want it, they need to be able to access those trade deals.“We’re getting conflicting clarication from producers and the government, we’re waiting for clarication on that and the same the other way.“On qualying goods, pigs going to Cookstownto be slaughtered from Republic of Ireland, and processed into UK market, is that a qualying good Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agri-food sector in the history of the State.Joe Healey“These are the things we need the answers to.”Mr Chesnutt added that the dangers to agriculture are not limited to the border counties.“This is not just a border community issue, this is the whole island of Ireland, we are completely integrated, as far as the north is concerned, for the prosperity of agriculture, we need to do something sensible to get this worked out.”Mr Chesnutt added that his group, which represents farmers in Northern Ireland, and had backed Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, said the situation had “gotten very political from the start”.“We did get some quite nasty criticism but we stand by the decision,” he said.“We moved on from there, now we have a new deal on the table, some say we’ve the best of both worlds in this deal, but we’re not so sure of that, that’s something we need clarication on.”All representatives speaking to the committee were clear that the sector has already begun to see the effects of Brexit.“Brexit presents the most serious threat to Irish farming and our agri-food sector in the history of the State,” Joe Healy, the president of the Irish Farmers Union, said on Wednesday.“With .bn euro of our food and drinks exports going to the UK, no other member state and no other sector is as exposed in these negotiations.“The UK is the market for % or , tonnes of Irish beef exports.“For the beef sector, the threat from Brexit is frightening.“The reality is, even before Brexit, massive damage is already being done to Irish agriculture.“In the past year alone, Brexit uncertainty and the devaluation of sterling have had a very negative impact on Irish agriculture, with losses in the beef sector alone at m euro up to the end of September .”The committee also heard that farmers had lost confidence in the industry, and that a major concern is a fall in funding for CAP payments after Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38622653.ece/b7be8/BINARY/181019dk2005.jpg","title":"northern ireland children eating seven times their daily limit of

years old reported as being overweightor obese .One of the key messages from the new campaign is that it takes a hero to be the bad guy.It warns that cutting back on treats can be really challenging and no parent wants to say no, but in these situations, children need to be protected - \"so be a hero and say no\".Visit the START campaign website at www.makeastart.org for helpful parenting tips on reducing treats, ideas for alternative healthy snacks, practical tools and videos to help reduce treats and supportive advice on how to make a healthy, positive start"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The rest are currently in the care of the RSPCA Middlesex branch.Pet welfare expert at the RSPCA Dr Jane Tyson said: “Without having fur to keep them warm, they also readily feel the cold so extra care needs to be taken in colder weather to help them stay warm.“They can also scratch their skin easily so bedding must be soft and it’s a good idea to make sure their nails are kept in good condition to make sure they don’t injure themselves.Warthog the Skinny Pig.“Although Guinea pigs are very misunderstood pets in some ways – for example, they should not be kept with rabbits – they are also very rewarding and characterful creatures.”Cheryl O’Keeffe, animal welfare administrator at RSPCA Middlesex, said: “We have absolutely fallen in love with the skinny pigs here – all the staff love spending time with them as they are real characters. They aren’t everyone’s cup of tea but I expect they will be rehomed quickly to the right family.”"},{"url":null,"title":"paris olympic logo compared to tinder shampoo and jennifer aniston","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Kremlin told Kurdish fighters to pull back from the entire frontier or  they would face being “steamrolled” by Turkish forces.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan echoed those warnings, saying his military would resume its offensive against Kurdish fightersthe new arrangements are not carried out.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Russian military police have started patrols in northern Syria Mr Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached an agreement on Tuesday that would transform the map of north-east Syria, installing their forces along the border and filling the void left by the abrupt withdrawal of American troops. The Kurdish fighters, who once relied on the US forces as protection from Turkey, were given a deadline of next Tuesday evening to pull back from border areas they have not already left.Iraq, meanwhile, closed the door on the US military’s attempt to keep the troops leaving Syria on its soil. Iraqi defence minister Najah al-Shammari said that those troops were only “transiting” Iraq and would leave within four weeks, heading either to Kuwait, Qatar or the United States.Mr al-Shammari spoke after meeting US defence secretary Mark Esper, who earlier this week had said the American forces from Syria would remain in Iraq to fight the so-called Islamic State group. Iraqi’s military said they did not have permission to do so.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Syrian government forces The clumsy reversal underscored the blow to US influence on the ground in the wake of President Donald Trump’s order for US troops to leave Syria. Those forces were allied to the Kurdish-led fighters for five years in the long and bloody campaign that brought down the Islamic State group in Syria.Now a signicant swathe of the territory they captured is being handed over to US rivals, and the Kurds have been stung at being abandoned by their allies to face the Turkish invasion launched on October .The Kremlin pointedly referred to that abandonment as it told the Kurds to abide by the Russian-Turkish accord.“The United States was the closest ally of the Kurds during the last few years, and in the end the US ditched the Kurds and effectively betrayed them,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, according to Russian newswires.“It’s quite obvious thatthe Kurdish units don’t withdraw with their weapons then Syrian border guards and Russian military police will have to step back. And the remaining Kurdish units will be steamrolled by the Turkish army,” he said.Turkey considers the Kurdish fighters terrorists because of their links to Kurdish insurgents in Turkey. It has demanded they retreat from the entire border region, creating a “safe zone” where Turkey could also settle some of the . million Syrian refugees on its soil.Ankara would gain that goal under the new accord with Moscow along with the agreement last week with the US that put a ceasefire in place.Kurdish forces completed withdrawing on Tuesday from a stretch of territory  miles wide along the border and  miles deep between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad. That pullback, allowing Turkish-backed forces to take over, was required under the US-Turkish accord.The new agreement with Russia allows Turkey to keep sole control over that area. For the rest of the north-eastern border, Russian and Syrian government forces will move in to ensure the Kurdish fighters leave. Then after the deadline runs out on Tuesday, Turkish and Russian forces will jointly patrol a strip six miles deep along the border.The Russian defence ministry said a convoy of military police had crossed the Euphrates River and deployed in the Syrian border town of Kobane.“The military police will help protect the population, maintain order, patrol the designated areas and assist in the withdrawal of Kurdish units and their weapons  kilometres away from the border,” it said.The Turkish military said it would not resume its offensive “at this stage” after the US-brokered ceasefire expired on Tuesday night. However, foreign minister Mevlut Cavusolgu said that Turkish forces would “neutralise” any Syrian Kurdish fighters they come across in areas that Turkey now controls.President Erdogan said the attack would start againthe Kurdish pullback does not take place."},{"url":null,"title":"487990","story":"Scenes at Stormont this week have been branded “farcical” after the first official meeting of MLAs in over  days failed to get off the ground. A last-ditch attempt to block abortion law changes in Northern Ireland led by the DUP failed, with the law changing at midnight on Monday. Unionist parties, who oppose the upcoming liberalisation, triggered the assemblys recall with a signed petition. Members of the SDLP were also in attendance. But Speaker, Robin Newton, informed MLAs that the Assembly had to elect a speaker and deputies with cross community support before any other business could take place. That became impossible when SDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared he wasn’t willing to facilitate a “unionist talking shop” and led his party out of the chamber. As they made their way out cries of “shame” were shouted by DUP MLAs. googletag.cmd.push As a result of their leaving no nationalist representatives remained, meaning no new speaker could be elected and the sitting was suspended after less than an hour. Jim Allister accused the SDLP of thwarting the formation of an Assembly and said they were therefore thwarting legislation to protect the lives of unborn children. The DUP later walked out, vowing that this was not the end of the matter and they would seek to challenge the law. Mrs Foster said it was a shameful day which would leave Northern Ireland with Europes most liberal abortion laws. They were swtly followed by the UUP after Robin Swann labelled the day’s events a “pantomime” and called on the Secretary of State to consider whether there is any future for the NI Assembly. ‘Pantomime’ Some unionist assembly members had been attempting to introduce the Defence of the Unborn Child Bill , which they hoped to pass by midnight. Two members tabled a Private Members’ Bill in an attempt to halt the Westminster legislation decriminalising abortion. DUP MLA Paul Givan argued the point as to why it should happen having sought legal advice from the Attorney General. The DUP leader Arlene Foster implored the Speaker to share his legal advice with MLAs. However, Mr Newton - who was elected as a DUP MLA - resisted attempts to persuade him to suspend assembly rules to allow the bill to be introduced. Legal advice was sought, he said, and he was content with the guidance provided which is “confidential and privileged”. In July, MPs at Westminster passed legislation which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Irelanddevolution is not restored by  October. Mondays sitting was the first time the assembly had sat for nearly three years.

He was killed aged just  whilst taking part in the dam busters raid in May, .Reporter: Eamon Sweeney::  Oct   addthis, Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II.Richard Bolitho was born in Derry on January ,  but was killed at the age of just  having taken part in one of the most pivotal events of World War II. William Bolitho, Richards father, was a Cornish commercial traveller in the seed business who stayed on in Ireland after marrying Jane Cuthbertson, the daughter of a local land steward, from Braehead just outside the city. In  the Bolithos moved from Derry to the town of Kimberley in Nottinghamshire where they bought a hotel. Presumably, while his mother and father got the new business up and running, Richard moved in with his aunt Emily who owned a local fruit and vegetable store. But, after her death, William Bolitho sold the hotel and took over the shop. googletag.cmd.push The young Richard Bolitho, an only child, was educated at the nearby Church Hill School and from there won a scholarship to Heanor Grammar School in . He joined the RAF in  but it wasnt until  that he was selected for aircrew training. After qualying as an air gunner Bolitho was posted to an operational training unit where he teamed with five others and they all flew together for the first time on February , . Six weeks later they were all posted to the newly formed  Squadron. Before WWII the British Air Ministry had identied the industrialised Ruhr valley as an important strategic target. The dams along the valley were the valuable source of providing hydroelectric power and pure water for steel-making as well as drinking water and water for the canal transport system in Germany. The belief was that attacks on the dams with large bombs could effectively cripple the manufacturing base heavily prized by the Nazis but at this stage the RAF had been unable to accurately hit hard enough to achieve that aim. It was calculated that a surprise nocturnal attack could work but there was no explosive device capable of achieving it. This is where Barnes Wallis came in. A scientist, engineer and inventor in early  he had begun experimenting with skipping marbles over water tanks in his garden. From this he developed a paper called Spherical Bomb-Surface Torpedo, the idea being that a bomb could skip over the surface of water, avoid torpedo nets and sink directly beside a battleship or a dam and act as a depth charge with the surrounding water concentrating the force of the explosion on the target. Wallis also developed backspin on these devices that would cause the bombs to trail behind the aircraft that dropped it and decreased the chance that the plane would be damaged by the explosion. It also increased the range of the bombs and prevented them from moving away from the target wall as it sank. After initial doubts, the RAF accepted Wallis bouncing bomb for attacks on the Mohne, Edersee and Sorpe dams in the Ruhr valley. Operation Chastise was carried out on - May,  by Squadron  which included Richard Bolitho. Using two spotlights to gauge the correct height, a modied Lancaster Bomber dropped a backspin drum shaped bomb which bounced over the dams torpedo nets hit the wall and spun down to the base before exploding. The Mohne and Edersee Dams were hit and caused catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and the villages in the Eder area. The Sorpe dam sustained minor damage. Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and and several more damaged. Factories and coal mines were also destroyed. The human cost was also catastrophic. Overall, an estimated , civilians- Germans and , mainly forced labourers from the Soviet Union died. By necessity of achieving their aim, one plane flew so low that it hit the sea with the result that its bomb was torn off and scooped up seawater into the fuselage. Another plane was consumed by flames when it ploughed straight into high voltage electricity cables. However, some historians have argued about the levels of success that the raids achieved stating that the dams were repaired in a matter of five months. The head of the RAF, Sir Arthur Bomber Harris thought that the entire episode had been harebrained all along later wrote: I have seen nothing to show that the effort was worthwhile except as a spectacular operation. The inventor of the bouncing bomb Barnes Wallis was awarded the sum of pound, for his war work from the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors. But, because of the loss of so many peoples lives during the raids he donated the entire amount to Christs Hospital School in  which allowed the children of the RAF personnel killed or injured to attend the school. Richard Bolithos last leave from the RAF before what became known as the Dam Busters raid was spent at home in Kimberley, Nottinghamshire where he was joined by his colleagues Flyod Wile, John Kinnear and Albert Garshowitz. Days later, in the early hours of Monday, May   all of them were killed during the raid. Sergeant Richard Bolitho was rear gunner on the mission his Lancaster Bomber was sent out on the first wave of aircraft taking part in the attacks. Their plane went down near Marbeck in Germany after being hit by anti-aircraft fire and were buried at Borken. They were later reinterred at Reichwald Forest War Cemetery. In all,  men in  planes took part in the attacks on the dams- of them died and three were captured. The Derry born Dam Buster is remembered on a war memorial which was first placed at his former school, Heanor Grammar School and later moved to Marpool All Saints Church in Nottinghamshire when the school closed in . Richard Blothios name is also on the war memorial at Kimberley, the village where he grew up. In May, ,  years after the Dam Busters raids on Germany portraits of all  men painted by artist Dan Llywelyn were unveiled at the Bomber Command Centre in Lincoln and the Dambusters Inn at Scampton in Lincolnshire from where the Lancaster bombers departed. In , three years after Richard Bolithos death, his parents ed to live in Northern Ireland and saw out their days in Portrush. Thirty-one years earlier on November ,  Richard Bolithos grandmother, Jane Cuthbertson from Braehead was buried at Derry City Cemetery having passed away at the age of . Her husband, Robert Cuthbertson was buried with his we having passed away on February ,  aged . Their daughter Jane Bolitho, Richards mother, died aged  on November ,  and is buried with her parents. Her husband William had died  years before her on May , aged  but is buried in his own plot in the city cemetery. Inscribed on the Cuthbertson grave in Derry is: Also their grandson Richard Bolitho, Flight Sergeant RAF VR, Killed in Action, Ruhr Dams,  May, , Aged  years.

And quite literally rising out of the ashes into a stronger, more resilient club with first class facilities. “Sean Dolans GAC are always welcoming new members and supporters, and I would urge the community in Creggan to get behind the club to ensure that this development is successful in building a vibrant Gaelic community not just in Creggan, but in this city.

A report entitled, ‘Unearthed’, summarises some of the most signicant archaeological discoveries in Northern Ireland between  and . In this period almost  licensed archaeological excavations took place, mainly as a requirement of the planning process. The publication was produced by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division . The report details how a “large enclosure” was uncovered within a housing development off the Skeoge Link Road in the Ballynagalliagh area of Derry. It was located on a relatively steep, south facing slope. googletag.cmd.push The enclosure was constituted of  post holes with  posts forming a separate arc in the north-west corner of the site. The majority of the post holes were of considerable size, with half of them producing broken bits of pottery, also known as sherds, within their fills. Some of these have been identied as belonging to the Vase tradition of Bronze Age pottery and other sherds have been identied as coming from the Cordoned Urn tradition. The general date provided for the use of the site is – BC. A substantial rectangular Neolithic house was identied at Turmeel townland, Co. Derry during the archaeological investigation of the A road near Dungiven. It measured approximately m long and m wide and contained almost  sherds of Neolithic pottery. The building was constructed during the period when farming and agriculture were introduced almost , years ago. At the Glenshane Road near Claudy a Late Neolithic ritual site was discovered during a quarry extension. This consisted of a timber circle – large wooden posts with an outer fenced forecourt – which dated to circa  BC. Timber circles are likely to have been the focus of elaborate ritualised activities attended by large numbers of people. HED Senior Archaeologist Andrew Gault said: “These excavations have resulted in exciting and important new information about our past, from evidence of the homesteads of some of the first prehistoric farming communities in Northern Ireland to more recent urban archaeological remains and industrial heritage. “It is intended that ‘Unearthed’ will continue as a regular annual bulletin of the most signicant archaeological discoveries arising from development-led archaeology in Northern Ireland.”  Discoveries in other parts of the country include a Bronze Age roundhouse at Rasharkin solar farm. It consisted of a post-ring, an internal heath, areas of stakeholes, and a segmented enclosure. Enclosed houses generally date to the Middle Bronze Age, c.  BC. Finds included a possible rubbing stone and several sherds of Late Bronze Age coarseware pottery. An th th-century tannery, a place where animal hides are tanned, was discovered within the centre of the site at Royal Exchange in Belfast. This site is located within what would have been the th-century core of the city, an urban industrial operation where leather would have been produced commercially. This was represented by a series of  tanning pits, the majority of which were constructed of wooden planks joined together by wooden dowels. Mr Gault concluded: “These new discoveries highlight the importance of archaeological mitigation in advance of development, as well as the signicant contributions made by developers and archaeologists in unearthing these new archaeological sites for the benefit of all in society.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This Friday, passionate wildle lover Killian McLaughlin will see his lelong dream of reintroducing some of Irelands extinct animals to their former natural habitat become a reality when the gates to his new sanctuary opens to the public.

Killian McLaughlin pictured with his wolves at the soon to be opened Wild Ireland animal sanctuary this weekend.  Speaking to the Derry Now, Killian said the purpose of Wild Ireland was to educate people on Irelands lost natural history, whilst giving a home to badly neglected animals. “If you go back thousands of years to when Ireland was covered in forest you would have found these animals roaming about,” Killian explained. “Due to humans, these creatures have been lost forever through hunting and deforestation. “What were trying to do here is to educate people that these animals belong here. We are quick to condemn other countries in Africa or Asia about the cruelty of hunting but we have already lost or native animals through hunting. “There are fossils of brown bears found in caves that show how many bears we had in Ireland thousands of years ago, the same goes for the lynx. “We have three wolves here and they only went extinct from Ireland in .” Working with several charities, Killian and his team rescued the animals from terrible conditions. “Working with Bears in Mind, we managed to persuade the Lithuanian government to give us the bears for rehoming. “They were kept in terrible conditions, they never even felt soil before, they were so used to concerte they were unsure of the ground but now they are beginning to be bears again. “We built them a three-metre deep pool so they can submerge themselves, before that the deepest water they had known was in their water dish,” Killian said. Despite being a full time job in itself, Killian has to juggle his work at the sanctuary with his day-job of being a solicitor. “Its been full on,” Killian laughed. “But I love what were doing here.

This is going to go to the last game no matter what andwe want to finish third orwe want to qualy for Europe then we have two games to win. googletag.cmd.push Unusual City’s winning goal was unusual to say the least but for Devine it was a case of his team making their own luck.“I think it started with our aggressive press,” he said. “It started with David Parkhouse pushing really hard to get down the line. Obviously it was a bit of fortune for us but Barry had to be in there, he had to be chasing the ball down. “It was a bit of fortune but over the course of the year we haven’t carried a lot of luck. We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

After a forgettable first half, Derry got the goal the game desperately needed on  minutes when Ciaran Coll raced into the area and as Clarke came out to narrow the angle, he simply rolled the ball across the face of goal for David Parkhouse to slot home his th goal of the season. googletag.cmd.push The game was now more open and it did not take St. Pat’s long to level the game when Ian Bermingham’s shot deflected kindly into the path of Chris Forrester who turned and fired low past Cherrie into the net to make it -. The final  minutes were extremely tense with the game in the balance but Derry came within inches of restoring their lead when Junior released McDonagh on the right and his low ball shot right across the face of goal with no Derry player there to touch it into the net. The Brandywell was stunned into silence however as St. Pat’s scored two goals in three minutes to seal the win. Substitute James Doona, on the pitch a matter of moments, raced clear of the Derry defence and sent the ball past Peter Cherrie who didn’t move as the ball rolled past him into the net.

The original production featured footage of the Foyle River, Grianán Fort and other border landmarks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, but for Mexico, this has been replaced by stunning new drone shots of the landscapes of Guadalajara – while the voice and words of Dublin spoken word poet Stephen James Smith on the track “This Island” have been substituted by those of Mexican poet, Elba. Eoin said he hoped the piece, which  takes audiences on a cinematic journey, questioning what borders mean to people, would resonate with the people of Mexico. “About two years ago I was working with other artists in Jalisco and happened to mention the Borders project – it seemed to resonate with them – what with the US border and Trump wall - and felt like something that needed to be performed there. We’d also always wanted to perform Borders on a large scale and I already had connections with the Zapopan Symphony Orchestra, so creating this new version just seemed like a good fit. “The original piece with Stephen James Smith focused on the way we live now and how it’s ok to be both Irish and British – so we wanted to do something similar in Mexico. “Luckily, Elba understood and got what we wanted straight away and will perform her own version with us on the night. “The crazy thing about the whole project was the drone shots when I initially looked at them, I thought they were taken in Ireland, not Mexico. We were kind of disappointed as we were expecting cacti everywhere, but the coastal landscapes look just like Donegal.  \"I guess it shows how much this is a global story – how lines are just man made and how this could have taken place on any country on earth.” Supported by the British Council and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, the pair will perform alongside the city’s Zapopan Symphony Orchestra – a full -piece orchestra - in their biggest gig of the year. This is not the first time Borders has been performed outside the North, with full capacity shows across Ireland, Britain and Europe, triggering a similar response with each audience. “There have been a lot of tears. The reaction so far has been pretty emotional, even most recently, during our Paris performance, which was unexpected.  \"People were seeing things in the visuals that we weren’t expecting, as they were left to interpret in their own way. The tears aren’t from sadness or depression though, but hope. “There’s a real communal feel during the shows with a lot of people fed up with what’s happening in the world - it’s quite beautul really, to be surrounded by a group people who feel the same way as you. He concluded: “I think we’ll get a similar reaction in Mexico,not more so – especially since we’re touching on their own problems and have Elba there to read her more personalised, local poem.” Following Mexico, it’s going to be a busy few months for the pair – performing Borders in Berlin, Toulouse and across Britain. Ryan said: “Next month we’re off to Berlin for the th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, followed by a full UK tour, then in March we’ll be playing at SXSW in Austin Texas. After that, we’re not sure, but it would be amazing to take Borders somewhere like Palestine or North Korea.” Jonathan Stewart, director, British Council Northern Ireland, said it was an honour to bring “Borders” to a wider audience. He said: “We’re delighted to support this project and help showcase Eoin and Ryan’s work internationally. “The times we live in can be incredibly isive, especially around the issue of borders, so it has never been more important for work such as this to reach wider audiences. Borders is a mesmerising visual spectacular and creates a world where boundaries just don’t exist physically but can also be metaphorical, and we hope that this message resonates and captivates the audiences in Guadalajara.” Borders will be performed this Friday and Saturday,  and  October, at the Centro Cultural Zapopan, Guadalajara.\",\"keywords\":\"Derry,MExico,Borders,Brexit\",\"articleSection\":\"Whats On\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Two Derry musicians are taking their ground- breaking audio-visual project, ldquoBorders, which began as a non-political reaction to Brexit, to Central America this weekend.\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.

When funding for the bypass has been confirmed, the piece of art will be fabricated.The news comes after it was confirmed recently that the Department of Finance is expected to approve the new roadrsquos economic appraisal by December which is viewed as a critical step in the process ahead of the required capital funding being released.While the required funding has not yet been made available, local politicians are hoping that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on site.The Department of Infrastructure says the preparation of the schemersquos economic appraisal report is continuing with Department of Finance approval for the document due to be sought before the end of the year.In order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents is ongoing in a bid to minimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.As part of the proposed multi-million pound development, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road. A new bridge will be constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass mdash which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district mdash is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.Roads officials are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the bypass would provide a good economic ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Children.jpg","title":"Children from integrated schools listen talk  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH school played host to a conference to mark World Mental Health Day last Thursday.Over  young people from  integrated schools across the province converged on Drumlins Integrated Primary School to take part in lsquoListeningrsquo mdash an event organised by the Integrated Education Fund.The compere was BBC presenter Jo Scott ands guest speakers included Mr Richard Pengelly, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health, and Kate Beggs, from the Northern Ireland Director of National Lottery Community Fund.Mr Pengelly said afterwards: ldquoYoung people are faced with a number of pressures including social media influences. Online bullying and exam pressure have all contributed to rising levels of anxiety and stress.ldquoIt is important we equip and educate our young people to deal with these issues and to look after their mental health.ldquoThere is support and help available for young people and their families and I urge them to avail of these services.Following talks delivered by young key note speakers, pupils discussed their views on the stresses and anxieties faced by young people.Participants were facilitated in small groups to share their thoughts and generated ideas to help develop support within their schools.Among those taking part were Kori Colgan-Murphy, a GCSE student at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, who has been a member of the schoolrsquos Gender Sexuality Alliancegroup for a number of years.ldquoThe GSA is open to all students including LGBTQ students and their allies, she said. ldquoIt is a place where students can come together to socialise, discuss issues, and support one another.Paul Collins, campaign fundraiser with the Integrated Education Fund, said: ldquoSchools in Northern Ireland have seen a dramatic increase in the number of young people with mental health issues.ldquoThese could be anxiety or panic attacks, stress and depression, eating disorders and even, as we sadly know suicidal thoughts.ldquoThe aim of this conference is to provide an open environment to listen to children and young people.ldquoTeachers and parents need to find out what mental health issues are affecting young people in order to provide them with access to the right type of support.ldquoOn the basis of the group discussions, we hope to develop and deliver a plan that can help to address the mental issues impacting on our young people and their wellbeing..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Dads.jpg","title":"Dads helping autistic children enjoy their favourite sports with new project  ","story":"FOOTBALL is often a rite of passage sport for many young boys and girls but for children with autism, taking part in mainstream clubs or school activities can be overwhelming.Two local fathers are trying to make participation a lot easier and stress-free for their children to enjoy this team sport.Gerard McCartan and Daniel Craig from Downpatrick are just two of the many fully involved members of Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group.They have been taking a group of  local children aged between six and with autism for a specially adapted football course for the last three weeks at the Ballymote Sports and Wellbeing Centre.Devised by Gerard, who works for Disability Sport NI, the course aims to build skills in incremental levels in a way which focuses on enjoyment.Gerardrsquos eldest child Cahaacuten, , has autism and was diagnosed just before he went to primary school. He and his we, who are committee members of the support group, have have always tried to integrate activities and sports for all of their three children.ldquoI didnrsquot want football to be a negative experience for my son or any other child, said Gerard. ldquoTeam sports such as football can be overwhelming for children with autism either in school or any local clubs but that doesnot mean they should not be able to participate.Gerard said that he has devised the five-week course which helps build up football skills at the appropriate level for each child.It will finish with a match of children playing against their parents in two weeks time.ldquoNinety-two percent of children with autism have a sensory processing delay so as coaches being able to communicate effectively to the children in a way that they can understand is important, explained Gerard. ldquoWe give the kids reward cards so they and their parents can see their progression which builds up to the match.ldquoThe parents are a brilliant support as some of the children would get very anxious but to have their parents there beside them makes it possible. With the added bit of theatre and drama we try to instil, it heightens the whole experience for them and helps to make memories for both.Gerard hopes to devise further sports courses for autistic children such as boxing.Aacuteine Sloan, chairperson, of the group, praised the contribution of the fathers, not just for helping their own children but for other local children with autism whose parents are members.She said: ldquoNot only is it fantastic that a programme of its kind is now available locally but that itrsquos down to two dads who took it upon themselves to fill the gap.ldquoDownpatrick Autism Family Support Group is % run by parents. Wersquore delighted that Gerard and Daniel have developed this programme so our children can have the same opportunities as their peers. The children can enjoy football in a relaxed and non-judgmental environment.Ms Sloan said that many children on the autism spectrum cannot attend the usual football sessions due to crowds, noises, dficulty following instructions and other considerations.She added: ldquoThis now gives these children the same chance as their peers.This is just one of the many programmes we have running at the minute. We currently have Lego therapy, pony therapy, occupationaltherapy and ious parent training nights.ldquoWe would urge any local families pre and post diagnosis who need some extra support to get in touch via our Facebook page at Downpatrick Autism Family Support Group..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Down.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre goes from strength to strength  ","story":"THE success story at the new Down Leisure Centre continues with ious user targets set ahead of its official opening almost one year ago being smashed.Local council officials have revealed that user numbers are ldquoextremely high with membership of the fitness suite particularly impressive.However, the huge demand to use the ultra-modern poundm facility is causing problems for council officials.

Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

He recalls that his mystical experience revealed to him that all people are mutually interdependent and all people are essentially good.Signicantly, the revelation led to him leaving his study of medicine and immersing himself in the study of psychology, social anthropology, sociology and African languages. And, during university vacations, Stan engaged in so-called participant observation research as a nursing assistant in psychiatric hospitals.He also played music with an African group known as lsquoThe Kirela Kidsrsquo, two of whose members, Robert and Joshua Sithole were proclaimed to be a foremost penny-whistler and second best guitarist in South Africa respectively at a jazz awards ceremony.It was through these musiciansthat Stan met his future we, Selin Mahlvane, who was herself a singer of traditional African music and a jazz singer.In , the author was awarded both BA and a BSc Science degrees, also receiving a bursary for being the top sociology student which resulted in his engaging in further studies, leading to him receiving an honours degree.After this, Stan engaged in further participant observation studies, this time as a lsquopretending patientrsquo in a mental hospital in Swaziland, subsequently writing this research up as a thesis, entitled, ldquoSituations: a model for the analysis of mental hospital practicesrsquorsquo. He received PhD degree for this research.While he was in Swaziland, Stan married Selin, a black South African. Such a marriage was illegal in South Africa and was banned under the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act. The couplersquos son, Kenneth, was born in Swaziland and was smuggled across the border into South Africa and itrsquos this backstory which forms the genesis of his new book.Already an acclaimed author, Stan argues that the reason psychiatric hospitals and psychiatry were so signicant was because the way hospitals treated patients was equivalent to the way black people were classied and dominated in apartheid South Africa.All this is described in his new book, along with a way to evaluate the therapeutic value or lack of value in staff-patient interactions.When Stan came to Northern Ireland, he became a clinical psychologist, working in psychiatric hospitals. He was also the co-founder of a self-help group for mastering anxiety, panic and stress.Some of the background to this group is contained in his new book, as well as in another publication entitled lsquoSoul On Firersquorsquo mdash a guide to mastering anxiety, which is also available on Amazon.Together with the process of mastering anxiety, Stan also engaged in research into overcoming depression, put together in a book entitled lsquoRising from the Deadrsquo and the process of recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, contained in lsquoVictory of the Spiritrsquo.All this, he says, forms part of an understanding of the radical alternative to psychiatric colonialism.ldquoThe worst part of psychiatry lies in its process of diagnosing so-called mental illness, along with its prescribing of drugs, supposedly for correcting and lsquochemical imbalance in the brainrsquo says the author.Dr Papenfus illustrates that such a chemical imbalance does not exist. In fact, he argues that the ldquofraud involved in creating and medical basis for psychiatry is no more than a myth and there is shown in great detail in the book.Also demonstrated in great depth is what the author describes as the ldquounscientic basis of pharmaceutical companies supposed lsquotestingrsquo of prescribed psychiatric drugs.ldquoThis fraudulence results in millions of peoplersquos lives being ruined, year after year and in one country after another, said Dr Papenfus.ldquoEven children are now becoming a huge market for prescribed psychiatric drugs and some of their extremely dangerous effects are described. The research involved in this exposure calls for a dramatic and urgent response. This is what lsquoRenewing our Livesrsquorsquo provides.Between  and , Dr William Barrington was the leading psychiatrist at the Downshire Hospital in Downpatrick. According to Dr Papenfus, it was during these years that traditional bio-psychiatry was replaced with social psychiatry.ldquoUnder his guidance therapy always included a social dimension, said the author. ldquoGoals were formulated and realised. The personal empowerment of patients included regular reviews of what was going on and how everyone was making sense of everyone .ldquoThe result was that the Downshire Hospital was widely regarded as the best psychiatric facility in Europe. Because Dr Barringtonrsquos way of working was still strikingly held by many nurses, social workers and others, this is what persuaded me to come to work in the Downshire in .But, when he arrived, the author claimed that the ideology of the medical model of mental illness was in force once again and ldquothe dehumanising processes of bio-psychiatry was prominent once more.Despite this, the author says a transformation was still possible ands this is the hope behind his new book.Two copies of the new book have been placed in Downpatrick Library and it is also available on order, from Amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Roy.jpg","title":"Roy Living healthy life to win coveted NI fitness accolade  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Roy Livingstone has won the Centra Action Cancer Endeavour Award at the Northern Ireland Health and Fitness Awards.The prestigious event sponsored by Centra mdash held at Belfastrsquos Crowne Plaza and attended by  guests mdash celebrated the outstanding achievements of the local health and fitness industry.The awards were presented by TV personality and fitness advocate Vogue Williams and Q Radiorsquos Ibe Sesay.Roy has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help raise much-needed funds for Centrarsquos charity partner, Action Cancer, cycling from London to Paris and, most recently, a -mile cycle in San Francisco.Congratulating the Portaferry man on his win, Jenner Morton, Centra brand manager, said that over the years, Roy ldquoreally has gone the extra mile when it comes to fundraising for Action Cancer.She continued: ldquoFrom his cycles in Paris and San Francisco alongside local events and initiatives, Roy and the wider team at Centra in Portaferry have made a real impact with the funds they have raised.ldquoFrom everyone at Centra, wersquod like to say a big thank you to Roy.Funds raised by Centrarsquos customers go towards funding the health action programme which educates children of all ages about leading healthier lestyles as well as Action Cancerrsquos so-called big bus which travels across the Province driving home early cancer detection..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Traders.jpg","title":"Traders offered input into Irish Street scheme  ","story":"BUSINESS owners in Downpatrick are to be given a key input into ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station site and a number of adjacent empty buildings.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy, with both organisations working alongside the Provincersquos Strategic Investment Board.Last week, the Recorder revealed that a development brief designed to transform the sprawling town centre site as part of a multi-million pound investment was being progressed, with hopes that the document could be completed before the end of the year.During Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee,council officials confirmed that town centre traders, Downpatrick councillors and relevant public agencies will be involved in discussions to guide the development brief process.When the brief has been agreed, it will be advertised, inviting developers to come forward to transform the site to kick-start a signicant town centre economic regeneration initiative.A formal launch of the brief is also planned before Christmas.Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains are reported to be interested in opening new premises in Downpatrick and view Irish Street as an ideal location as there are currently no other suitable sites available.The development brief will outline what the local authority would like to see developed in Irish Street to maximise the potential of every square inch of available space.Permission has also been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the Irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.It is understood that as part of the regeneration scheme, the vacant buildings adjacent to the former police base will be bulldozed to open up a huge area. The development site also includes the council-owned Irish Street car park.However, the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious regeneration plan and is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed progress on developing the brief for the Irish Street redevelopment.Cllr Curran, who has been asking for traders to be involved with helping shape the development brief, is delighted this is going to happen to help shape the future development of the Irish Street site.He said it is critical all key stakeholders are involved in what will be the biggest ever investment in the town centre.Cllr Curran believes that with everyone on board at this early stage, the planned new retail and commercial centre has a signicant chance of succeeding, providing a boost for all businesses in the town.ldquoThis planned development can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses who have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for generations, he said.ldquoWhile details of the Irish Street scheme were announced almost two years ago, signicant progress is now being made. I have no doubt that the opportunity to redevelop a major town centre will appeal to many in the construction industry.Cllr Curran said the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town cannot be overstated.Cllr Hanlon agreed that the redevelopment proposal will provide Downpatrick with a much-needed economic boost and welcomed plans to form a stakeholder group to feed into the development brief.She added: ldquoThis forum will be open to all Downpatrick businesses and I would encourage their participation and views to ensure that all ideas are heard and considered. This will no doubt maximise the benefit of the proposed regeneration of this site for all of Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16th October 2019 Funeral.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to former Down GAA star Eamonn Burns  ","story":"GLOWING tributes have been paid to former Down GAA player and manager Eamonn Burns who died suddenly last week.Hundreds of mourners turned out last Saturday to pay their final respects to the GAA star who was revered by everyone who knew him.A teacher at Shimna Integrated College where he was held in high esteem, Mr Burnshelped Down win two All Ireland titles in  and  and managed the team for three years before stepping down last summer.The father-of-two mdash who died following a heart attack mdash was buried at St Patrickrsquos Cemetery in Bryansford following a service of Requiem Mass in the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption in Newcastle.Local GAA teams lined the route as Mr Burnsrsquo remains were taken from his brother Colmrsquos house for Requiem Mass, while Shimna students formed a guard of honour at the church.Among the many tributes to Mr Burns was one from GAA president John Horan who said he had left ldquoa great legacy in the game.He added: ldquoOn and off the field Eamonn was a great ambassador for our association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Mr Horan said that it was with great sadness that he learnt of Mr Burnsrsquo passing and that it was only a few weeks ago at the jubilee dinner on All-Ireland football final day that he had the pleasure of meeting Eamonn and his colleagues as they saluted the th anniversary of the great lsquo Down team.He continued: ldquoThe special bond between the group was very evident and Eamonn was a big part of that. Not content with being a part of an iconic Down team, Eamonn was a man who was committed to giving back.ldquoHis club in Bryansford benefited and in more recent times he was prepared to put himself forward to take charge of the county team for three years and pass on his knowledge to a new generation of Down players.ldquoOn and off the field he was a great ambassador for our Association and we join our Mourne County colleagues and Gaels in lamenting his loss.Tributes have also been paid by former Down GAA legend Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty who referred to the late Eamonn Burns as ldquoa true legend because of the person he was.Doherty said: ldquoWhat very, very few people know is that in the build-up to one of the All-Ireland finals mdash I wonrsquot say which one mdash Eamonn was quietly nursing an injury. But such was his passion for Down that there was no way he was going to miss the game.ldquoFor me, that said much about the man he was. He ran the risk of maybe breaking down but through sheer willpower, courage and strength of character he came out triumphant.Doherty, one of the true GAA legends, said Eamonn Burns was never one to look for sympathy or seek comfort.ldquoHe stood on his own two feet and took what came at him. And when the going got tough he was always in there doing his bit for the cause. When you have a man like Eamonn in your corner, how could you fail to come out on top  he continued.Paddy Mo added: ldquoEamonn was a legend. Not just because he was a whole-hearted player who gave everything for the cause at club and county levels, but because he was as honest as the day is long.ldquoHe was a wonderful ambassador for our Association, honourable, dignied and respectful. In my book he was a true legend because of the person that he was. He has left a rich legacy both in a playing context and in the way he carried himself. His memory will linger on.Another colleague of the double All-Ireland winner, Conor Deegan, said he was left ldquonumb and devastated when he learnt of Eamonnrsquos passing.He added: ldquoWe are absolutely destroyed. Only a few weeks ago we were together at Croke Park. He took on the county job when it was not fashionable but nothing was ever about Eamonn there was just no ego with him. He just cared about the county. Itrsquos hard to believe that we will never see him again.Bryansford GAC mdash the Down manrsquos home club mdash which flew its flags at half mast following his passing mdash described Eamonn as ldquoa true legend of both club and county while Down GAA described him as ldquotrue son of Down.They said: ldquoEamonn has been taken from us too soon, we will miss you Eamonn but we will smile in the memory of the days that you gave us.Last Sunday, Eamonn Burnsrsquo sons Cathal and Thomas led the Down  team onto pitch in memory of father ahead of senior football final between Warrenpoint and Kilcoo at Pairc Esler, Newry.

The acts included opera with performers on horseback.ldquoThe horses were retired race horses which had been re-trained to perform in this show. There were breathtaking displays of riders with hoops and torches on fire, made all the more spectacular against the back of the floodlit castle.ldquoThe finale involved le-size inflatable horses, which were manipulated by dancers who moved with the music that filled the air. A spectacular display of culture for all to enjoy.On Sunday morning, the group viewed a historic presentation prepared by one of the historic and cultural associations in Lamorlaye.Ms Patterson explained: ldquoWe were then taken on a walking tour of the old Lamorlaye. The afternoon was free for the group to view a dressage display with ballet dancers at the Diane Stables. There was also a beautul show with Samurai warriors on horseback.ldquoThe activities just went on and on and the group was treated to a visit to a wine-making area in Gouvieux before being taken to the troglodyte quarter of Gouvieux and for a surprise dinner in a cave.The dinner was prepared by member of the committee and made all the more special because of the sing-song started by Herveacute Moula, chairwoman of the Lamorlaye Comiteacute de Jumelage, supported by Cllr Andrews and guests from Ballynahinch. The atmosphere was relaxed and this was the end to a lovely day.On the final day of the visit, the group was invited to view the facilities at the Golf du Lys, an exclusive golf course, which has facilities to host conferences, weddings and events, along with outdoor and indoor tennis courts, an outdoor pool and golf courses.Ms Patterson said: ldquoThe golf club has already hosted some players from Ballynahinch and they have asked uswe are interested in organising a reciprocal golf tournament with the local golf courses in Co Down.ldquoWe hope we will be able to take them up on this proposal when the French visit us in .ldquoOur final lunch was in a redundant factory complex which has been converted in to a stunning hotel and restaurant ndash testament to how an old property can be re-generated for the good of the community.ldquoThe programme for the weekend provided us with ample opportunity to meet up with those who had travelled over to Ballynahinch in July and to meet with some old faces from previous exchanges between Lamorlaye and Ballynahinch. It is our hope we will be able to sign a twinning charter with both the local council for the next five to ten years.Ms Patterson said that the two pilot exchange trips have shown the relationship is still as vibrant as ever, with new people getting involved on both sides.She added: ldquoWe are hoping to be in a position to host a small group over the St Patrickrsquos weekend and to take a small group out to Lamorlaye for the Bastille Day celebrations. We always welcome new families who would be interested in hosting French people and who would be interested in travelling out to France as part of the exchange.ldquoThose travelling pay for their own flights and the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group has facilitated the visits through the generous support of Newry Mourne and Down Council.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He explained to the Commonsrsquo Transport Select Committee that some hard shoulders on dynamic smart motorways are only open to running traffic during the morning and evening peaks, but this catches out some drivers when their routine changes.ldquoPeople whose normal daily commute takes place at am or am,theyrsquove been to the dentist and come out at am they drive down the hard shoulder, he said.ldquoWhen we close it at other times of the day, people still drive down it.Mr OrsquoSullivan said there is confusion over when the hard shoulder is and is not open to traffic.ldquoWe get people who stop there when itrsquos a running lane, he told the committee.ldquoWhat we also find is because people arenrsquot sureitrsquos a hard shoulder or a running lane, even when it is open, the usage of that running lane is much lower because people arenrsquot sure whether itrsquos a hard shoulder or not.He added: ldquoI donrsquot think we will be building any more dynamic hard shoulder smart motorways. Theyrsquore just too complicated for people to use.Other types of smart motorways include all lane running schemes where lane one ndash formerly the hard shoulder ndash is only closed in the event of an accident, and controlled motorways which have iable speed limits but retain the hard shoulder for emergencies.Smart motorways have been developed as a way of increasing capacity and reducing congestion without the more costly process of widening roads.There are growing concerns that the removal of a permanent hard shoulder has created a safety hazard, with some drivers being killed after stopping in live running lanes.In March, Derek Jacobs, , was killed when his car was hit after it stopped in the fast lane on a section of the M in Derbyshire converted to a smart motorway.This reportedly came months after a woman was killed on the same stretch of road after leaving a broken down car.But Mr OrsquoSullivan insisted that smart motorways are ldquoas safe or safer than conventional motorways.He added: ldquoI would prefer to break down in the live lane of a managed motorway or a smart motorway than I would prefer to break down on a live lane on a conventional motorway or on a dual carriageway.Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, told the PA news agency: ldquoThe rules, regulations and layouts of roads should be easy to comprehend whether people are driving along them at mph or mph.ldquoThe simpler motorways are to understand the safer they will be, as motorists concentrate on the hazards ahead rather than grappling with which lanes are available to them and which are not..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Some smart motorways are too complicated to use, says Highways England boss article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business.
